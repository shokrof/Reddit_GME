This entirely depends on dumdums selling their golden nuggets. How many golden nuggets are you going to give them? I've got mine and I'm diamond handing it. Why would I give up my golden nugget?


But realize they're going to hold as long as they can. They've already started hitting other shorts to build up cash for the inevitable GME squeeze. They cant hold forever of course but I guarantee you monday and tuesday are going to dip because of paper hands. 


So in the upcoming days, you'll have a discount on golden nuggets while the stock betas hold and wait for you to sell. You have FREE MONEY incoming in greater quantities...if you hold.

All you need to care about is the short interest ratio. Dont sell based on the stock price YET. Watch that short interest ratio and wait for it to approach 1. That's when you start selling. By that time your golden nuggets will hit thousands and you'll have all your tendies as promised.

This information has been discussed frequently the last view weeks, but may be new to the millions of autists and retards that joined in the last few days. You might be suppressing the stock by allowing your shares to be lent out to shorters.

""When can my shares be lent out?"":

If you have a margin account and are using the margin your shares are lent out by your broker to short sellers. Same thing when you are in a share lending program, IBKR and Schwab have those for example.

""How can I make it stop?"":

If it's possible cancel your enrollment in the share lending program or buy new stocks only in a cash account or something. But I'm retarded and no financial advisor so better google and look in here (the post I mostly ripped off for this). https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn3767/gme_gang_share_lending_education_for_dummies/ BTW I like GME

# When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

📷 [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%22&restrict_sr=1)

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

* Days  to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days  to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days  to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares  and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the  company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

\-  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same  thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin  Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take  alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share  movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

The reality is: GME will crash. Everyone knows this including Melvin. Melvin knows they can cover their short at a much lower price, why in the hell would they cover at $330 when the stock is worth $20 and will eventually go back to those levels?

He’s what the hive mind will say: “they have insane interest rates they have to pay on their short”. Those interest rates are nothing compared to how much it would cost to cover at $330 per share. MELVIN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO COVER THEIR SHORT AT THESE LEVELS. They are going to wait for the price to drop since it’s almost guaranteed to do so. Please listen to reason.

From what I understand, the clearing houses used to only require  a tiny percentage of the money used to purchase the stock as insurance while it is in the clearing process.
They changed that so that now, for certain stocks, they require 100% of the CASH which they will hold for the two days it takes to clear.
No margin buys allowed.
IF this is true, then what happens to the ITM options people hold at close?
Do they have to have 100% of available funds to purchase those shares in their account?
If they can’t purchase the shares, does the option expire worthless because people were unable to exercise?
An option is the right but not the obligation to purchase. That’s what it is.
If all these options expire today, what happens?

There is no mechanism in the stock market that allows shorters to get out without buying back ALL the shares that's currently floating on the market.

In fact, they're short on the shares they need to buy, because a good portion is held by institutions, ETF's, and Gamestop executives who will never sell all. And they're still short over 100%. Shareholders literally decide the price. They need to buy everything that's available to trade, no matter what.

Currently, they're propping themselves up by borrowing on 65% interest. 65% interest on borrowed money in the billions! They will fold eventually, most likely soon.

I admit that no one can see into the future, no one knows with 100% certainty how exactly things will go down, but that goes for all things in life. If you're still doubtful, even if you just put in $20 in fractional shares, you can likely sell it for any price you set it to when they cave and the squeeze inevitably happens.

To seize everything you ever wanted

In one moment

Would you capture it

Or just let it slip

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now

The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow

Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity

Ope, there goes Reddit, he choked He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy?

No He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes

It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke

He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's

Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody

Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping

This world is mine for the taking Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order

A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem

It only grows harder, only grows hotter He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him

Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter Lonely roads,

God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father

He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada

So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna,

but the beat goes on Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed

I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper

All the pain inside amplified by the

Fact that I can't get by with my nine to

Five and I can't provide the right type of

Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers

And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer

This is my life and these times are so hard

And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus

Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna

Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much

For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's

Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail

I've got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot

Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go,

I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot

So here I go, is my shot

Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

Amarin Corporation About To Shift From Loss To Profit,0,l7vwss,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7vwss/amarin_corporation_about_to_shift_from_loss_to/,19,1611964298.0,"With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at Amarin Corporation ($AMRN) future prospects. Amarin Corporation plc, a pharmaceutical company, develops and commercializes therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the United States. The US$2.9b market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$23m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$16m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Amarin will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company.

According to the 11 industry analysts covering Amarin, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of US$11m in 2021. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly a year from now or less! At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 61%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.

Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Amarin's upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.

Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 1.6% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.",2021-01-30 01:51:38

I messed around with stocks and options in my youth, but after losing a bunch of $, I swore that off for life.

That changed, today.

I have been watching this whole thing unfold from the sidelines. At first, I thought you all were just a bunch of money-hungry opportunists who would sell off as soon as GME hit $100.

But, you didn't sell.

Then the price rose to $300. I saw posts of people who made MILLIONS. Literal life-changing money. Yet, people did not sell.

I didn't quite understand at first, but after reading post after post about how hedge fund bankers ruined lives in 2008 and continue to ruin lives with blatant market manipulation behind closed doors, it's now extremely evident to me that the system is simply rigged against the common person.

I used to believe the narrative that anyone could make a killing in the stock market if they ""just played the game right."" Well, here you all are, playing the game right, buying stocks because you like them and think the value is higher than they do...and the ENTIRE SYSTEM is saying ""Oh never mind, making money in stocks is not for you common peasants, we need to keep you poor and stupid.""

I am simply astounded at the level of determination and diamond hands of this community. I don't know what this will do, or if anyone will see this, or what the real endgame here actually is, but all I know is that you all have these hedge fund billionaires scared SHITLESS for the first time in their lives. And, as someone who swore never to get involved in individual securities, I just bought GME. I won't ever sell this. When I am 75 and look at my portfolio, I want to see my GME position and be reminded of this moment. Whether it's $1 or $1000, I will not sell.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.

Nobody knows when though. But this is a pump and dump at its finest.

If you buy at $300 and it goes up to $500 will you sell and take $200 profit or will you hold thinking it will go to $1000? Will you sell at $1000? You must have an exit strategy.

What if it tanks back down to $10?

That's very likely.

Make sure that you do not invest your life savings into these YOLO plays.

Also people who are getting rich from owning options (not even owning shares exclusively) have 10,000% returns

At this point, the only way to have a 10,000% return on stock is if the price went to $30,000 per share... good luck with that!

TLDR be very careful and research before you throw everything you own into a meme stock

I wanted to let my fellow European (retard) investors know that just like the US has SEC we also have designated authorities we can complain and report to:

• Trading212 UK Ltd. is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK (Register Number 609146).  [Report suspected market abuse.](https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse/how-report-suspected-market-abuse-individual)

• Trading212 Ltd is regulated by the Financial Supervision Commission in Bulgaria (Register number RG-03-0237) which I assume covers the European investors. [File a complaint.](https://www.fsc.bg/en/for-the-consumers/complaints/) 

I encourage all European investors to contribute to this.

1) they made 3.6B last QUARTER alone from 6B in revenue. Thats 65% margin!!
2) short interest is 36% and get this, they only went public 4 months ago and they are already buying back $1B stock. Where have you ever seen anyone that goes public do a buyback this big so soon?!
3) they have no credit risk, i sent email to investor relations and their balance sheet shows the loans they make but they said they sell 100% of them back, 98% to the government and 2% to third parties so there is no credit risk here. This is what the shorts are missing because they’re lazy
4) on the last earnings call the ceo said they will announce a huge new partnership when they announce their next quarter and they said today that will be on 2/25
5) valuation: guys they will make 8B in profits this year on 14B in revenue and their entire market cap is just 45B!! This means they are trading at 5.5 times their PROFIT! the typical stock has a PE of 20 so this could be 4x and that DOES NOT even include the short interest
6) rkt ceo was on cnbc today and said “we know our partnerships and our profitability and this is not a stock you want to be short”
7) so many ipos come out and rise 100% right away and then go much higher. Rkt is super profitable and they went public at 18.50 and at 23 theyre barely up and have beaten big on both their last quarters

What happens when GME his 1000?,52,l7uvg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7uvg3/what_happens_when_gme_his_1000/,35,1611961858.0,"I think we should start talking about the collective action that we can take when GME hits 1000. If everyone plans to sell, then we're as bad as the fuckers we're trying to fuck over. GME will tank overnight and we'll mint a few new millionaires while the rest of the sub gets caught holding a bag of dog shit. Is there some collective action that we can take to help those with most need get out first? Maybe some will be greedy, but is there a way that we can coordinate our sells and holds so that those who were first in can be last out? We've proven that we can take money from those who need it least. Can we also prove that we can responsibly redistribute it to those who need it most, without cratering the stonk.

Really looking for thoughts here. I don't know if this is possible. I don't know how the markets could respond. I am not an economist or a financial advisor.

GME 1000 is coming and we need to be ready for it. DONT SELL UNLESS YOU NEED IT

Disclosure: I do not hold any shares in GME, but I am long AMC, because fuck em up on all fronts

EDIT: Seems like consensus here is GME 1Mil so ignore me maybe

I'm seeing a lot of talk about market orders.

DO NOT PLACE MARKET ORDERS!

All you do when you place a market order is reward 🧻✋ that are selling and funding their $420.69 limit sells.

Instead, in why not build an epic fucking wall of limit orders @ 300. If everyone's dry powder is sitting on the line at $300, the biggest Hedge Fund short dildo in the world ain't going to do shit. All you autists will be buying it back to $300 in a heartbeat.

**If you really want to buy, make it $301.**

**If you just want to be the last hope of holding the line, make it $299.**

If the price soars, it just gives all the hedgies another chance to re-up their shorts. It's far better to park the price above $300 and watch them bleed out on their billions of dollars in interest payments.

We don't need to be firing off our own 🚀's right now. Sit your ass down in this goat path, draw a line in the sand, and let them come and take our shares from us.

Short-seller ladder attacks - PLEASE READ THIS - POSTING AGAIN FOR VISIBILITY

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

NOT SELLING.

Your making hedgefunds money too. Blackrock and Scion capital in particular. TSLA is being shorted by Scion and Burry is making money there too. 

I think people got the point. can you guys go back to starting to stop shorts from making money from the rest of the market? I worked hard to build my portfolio and have been an avid follower of WSB but is this going to continue. I and like all other WSBers spend time to dig through SEC filings, market trends,  do research to support, do fundamental analysis and learn technical analysis. Is the point to get it to $1000 PT or get governments to level the playing field for us retail investors? 


We have media attention and the governments attention too. We have knocked two hedgefunds out with 100% losses and what it means to be short squeezed. because these were shorted does it mean that the funds or people aren't shorting other tickers? look at apple, Microsoft, MT, Tesla and almost every other ticker, shorts are making money. 

Now it should be time to pressure governments to change shorting laws so this doesn't happen again. Can I ask you guys to please go and support the other tickers?",2021-01-30 06:34:24

Capitalistic Version of a Re-distribution of Wealth,126,l844bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l844bn/capitalistic_version_of_a_redistribution_of_wealth/,12,1611982957.0,"I think we all know there’s been a major change over the past years wherein The People have been pushing for a more fair and equal country and world. There’s been support for versions of socialism, that some may or may not agree with, primarily because people want to be cared for and live in a just, non-corrupt world where each individual has equal opportunities to prosperity. 

Going back to the beginning of human-kind: when there is an absence of leadership or care for the citizens of a tribe, The People always find a way to fight back for themselves. 

I personally believe there’s been a lack of effective leadership for awhile in the world. We have wanted a more equitable world and, at least in America, there hasn’t yet been an effective way to reverse income inequality. Now, while our current situation maybe isn’t the end-all, it is so incredible to me because we are seeing The People fight back for themselves.  The governments of the world have seemingly pushed back on the redistribution of concentrated wealth via a more socialistic agenda. So what did this r/wallstreetbets community do? Utilized the tools (capitalism) at our current disposal to trigger a redistribution of wealth, from Hedge Funds that bet against our economy *to the everyday retail investor*. 

I truly hope this is a new day in the world. Where we can take issues into our own hands and solve problems and become more unified. Not only are we seeing major gains for the retail investor but a huge empathetic use of said gains; I love seeing all these donations to good causes like autism research, for example. 

I hope everyone keeps making tendies. GLTA

Common Sense Regulation by a Retard Because CNBC Guests Won't Talk About It,227,l83any,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83any/common_sense_regulation_by_a_retard_because_cnbc/,23,1611981039.0,"I have had CNBC up 24/7 to watch the shitshow happen on there. I know I shouldn't be to support our boi u/deepfuckingvalue, but I gotta know how the opposition is looking. The common thread among most of the supporters of big money is this: ""Let the SEC figure out how to regulate this. I don't want to comment."" Even AOC's stream, including her guests, wouldn't say anything. I think it's very important we voice our opinion on this. We need to let regulators know what WE want. If you disagree, you can downvote. That's the great thing about this. I have 10 years of game design experience and at the end of the day, Wall Street is a game with rules, so I felt like I could give us a voice here. So let's make the rules a bit more fair and less broken.

So my policy idea is simple: **Cash-Secured Shorts**.

Puts are cash secured. Why shouldn't shorts be? Unlimited downside is monumentally stupid. We've seen that concept broken down with this play. So how would this work? Simple:

When someone places a short, they have to set a max cash loss with it. This amount is cash secured and set aside so long as your short is live. This can be either done as a monetary value or a stop loss style tool.

If you want to sell options into that, you can, but if your stop loss triggers, the option is market purchased back. Much like a Margin Call. The short can still lose more than the cash secured amount, but it will be small enough to account for. It won't have infinite downside and will constrict mass short selling.

Benefits:

1. This allows short sellers to bet down without letting them do naked shorts with insane leverage.
2. There will never be a solvency issue with shorts again. At least not from shorts.
3. Short-based market manipulation will become much, much harder.

Cons:

1. This does not solve over-trading the float (which is not the problem). You can still get 140% float with shorts. At least it'll be cash secured.
2. Short selling strategies will become much more limiting, due to having to put up collateral.
3. Short squeezes can still occur and will be far easier to trigger this way. I think this will make short sellers think twice about trades they make and the 140% problem will go away.
4. It takes a little bit of work for brokerages to build a new system to change the way shorts are traded.
5. Education will have to happen. Fortunately it's usually only big money that shorts, so they'll figure it out fast.

From a user experience perspective, this isn't a difficult addition to their system. Cash secured puts are already in place, so the monetary hold can be reused. They will have to add a new bar that incorporates a selection tool for their cash secured value.

This is more complex UI than just allowing a straight sale of a shorted stock, but it's only one row. They can manage that in any brokerage app/system.

I believe my system will save the market from ever experiencing another short-based solvency issue. Margin can still be traded into shorts, but that becomes hedged by the people offering the margin, thus still keeping everything cash secured.

If you have anything you'd like to add to this or correct, feel free. Let's give the regulators something to work off of. Many don't seem to even know how this system works, so we can't leave it up to big money to ""teach"" them what they need to do to fix this. We'll end up getting screwed in the name of ""retail protection"".

If anyone can help share this, please do. I don't have Twitter. I think getting this upvoted will spread the idea and I'm hoping Youtubers and other people spread it or at least discuss it.

Like all Robinhood customers, I received an email today at 1:28pm stating that they may exercise or sell options expiring today due to market volatility.


My options were sold at 2:22pm (I am aware of Robinhood's 3:00pm cutoff time to sell, this was different).


This is blatant market manipulation and my options were illegally sold without my consent.

If you have an account full of boring boomer stuff like actual shares of SPY and so on listen up. If you're in for the long run you probably don't need to worry but if you might need the money in the not too distant future at least consider hedging with some OTM puts on SPY or some other index. These obviously need to be long dated, ideally 12+ months out. Don't devote too much, perhaps 1-2%. See it as plunge protection.

"No, Robinhood, Webull, and other brokers who limited buying yesterday are not colluding.

So what actually is happening?

**TLDR**; The DTC raised collateral limits to settle certain stock transactions from 1-3% to 100% for the 2 days held in escrow, which trickled down to clearing houses which don’t have the capital to clear the current trading volume at 100% collateral, so clearing houses restricted buying of those stocks to prevent themselves going under. Clearing houses are securing loans to bridge the gap and once additional capital is secured, will re-admit buying of those restricted stocks, including our beloved $GME.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

What is the DTC?

The Depository Trust Company is the bee’s knees. Back in the day when you bought a stock, you were given a piece of paper, like a $10 bill in your wallet, to certify that you have cleared payment of the stock and are now the rightful owner. This was all fine and dandy in the olden days when there far were fewer traders and even fewer companies to trade, but pesky humans just love to continue to invent new things, especially computers.

Can you imagine trying to trade stocks today still backed by pieces of paper? It just isn’t feasible. So in the early 1970s a digital solution was devised; enter the DTC.

The DTC is the record keeper of who owns what, and they certify >95% of all trades on the market. They are the ones who certify that /u/DeepFuckingValue (aka the God of WSB) actually owns the 50,000 shares he paid for a year ago and ensured whomever sold him those 50,000 shares got paid for them.

Watch the video: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtc.asp

DTC guarantees that if you sell a share, you will be paid for selling that share. Very important fundamental service provided.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

The two sides of the trade.

Whenever a trade happens there are two sides; the customer side and the street side (yes, the Wall Street). Brokers (Robinhood, e-trade, etc.) represent the customer side of the trade and the market makers represent the street side. When you place an order to buy a share from your broker, they in turn go to their Market Maker(s) to make the trade. The MM, after verifying things appears kosher, then sends the order to their clearing firm to begin settling the trade. In order to settle the trade with the DTC, the clearing firm is required to pay the DTC somewhere between 1%-3% of the notional value of the trade to be held as collateral in escrow for \~2 business days until the trade is settled. The clearing firm submits the trade to the DTC who certifies the trade and facilitates the final transaction and release of funds.

1. /u/DeepFuckingValue buys 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250,000)
2. Robinhood places order with their MM, Citadel (they bailed out Melvin with $2,750,000,000) who then communicates this order with the stock exchange the security is listed on
3. Citadel sends order to Apex (clearing house for Robinhood, Webull, Tastyworks, SoFi, Ally, and most of the newer app-based trading startups)
4. Apex sends trade to the DTC along with 2% collateral ($5,000)
5. Two days later the DTC says the trade is good and settles the transaction
6. The seller is paid $250,000 and /u/DeepFuckingValue is given his 50,000 shares. Brokers basically front the cash to make it all official during the 2 day settling period and your transaction shows in your account already even though it technically hasn’t yet settled.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So what happened on Thursday when buying became restricted?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es2YXQNVEAAepgT.png

The DTC, and consequently some clearing houses, for certain stocks raised their collateral requirements from \~2% to 100%. You read that right. If the collateral to buy 50,000 shares @ $5/share ($250k) was 2% ($5k), it was now raised to $250k. That means for every single buy order (from Robinhood, Webull, etc.) running through their clearing house was required to front 100% of the notional value to their clearing house, Apex, and have it sit there in escrow for 2 business days. 

Well look at the trade volume on $GME, it was averaging \~70M/day this past week before Apex’s buying restriction. If we assume half that daily volume was buy orders, 35,000,000 trades \* x shares per trade \* $$$/share = billions. Clearing houses simply are not equipped to front these levels of cash at 100% collateral, so buying was forcibly restricted.

It’s important to note that there is no collateral required on the other side of the deal, to sell a share, collateral is only required on the buy side. This is why you could still sell your share but not buy additional shares.

Another note about the clearing firms is, once trades that happened two days ago settle, the funds used for collateral become available to them again and if their risk models allow it, can re-open accepting new buy orders.

Brokers using different clearing houses, or brokers that can self-clear their trades, were generally still capable of handling these new requirements. A presumption could be made that if they are already large enough to be able to self-clear trades then they probably have access to more capital to meet collateral requirements and aren’t forced to deny new buy orders.

**I highly encourage each and every one of you to watch this interview with Webull’s CEO who explains exactly how they and brokers using Apex as their clearing house were forced to restrict buy orders due to increased collateral requirements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM**

🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now let’s look at this from the other side of the trade.

Melvin Capital shorted millions of shares of $GME. Their broker facilitated this action, which in-turn was transacted by their market maker(s), ran through their clearing house(s) and settled by the DTC. What happens when Melvin is bled dry?

Melvin loses everything, and it’s still not enough to cover their debt. The clearing house is next on the chopping block and steps in to provide the funds that Melvin can no longer provide. They write it off as a loss and will be amongst the first in line of creditors seeking payment during Melvin’s solvency process to try and recoup whatever possible. But what happens if they can’t cover the cost of all of those shares?

And that’s where we’re at today. Clearing houses are seeking short-term bridge loans from major institutional banks to secure enough $$$ to settle everybody’s trades. They are teetering on the edge and are shoring up their accounts for the pending tidal wave that is our beloved short squeeze. If they run out of money, the market could cease to function properly and we’re looking at a near system-wide collapse.

Bleeding Melvin dry means bleeding Melvin, their market maker(s), AND their clearing house(s). The MMs & the clearing house(s) are collateral damage and should not be the target of our focus. But don’t worry, they’re all insured anyways, but they still need funds now to continue to function nominally.

So at the end of the day, Citadel didn’t exactly go to each broker and tell them “hey, stop letting people buy shares so we can exit out of our positions.” But they are using their MM advantage to continue their ladder attacks to drive the price down. As a MM they are allowed to increase liquidity by creating new shorted shares, but they must be repaid by market close. 

So are they playing dirty? Of course they are, and we expected them to. If you managed billions of dollars, wouldn’t you do everything in your power to prevent losing it? Sure, they didn’t heed warnings from their risk assessment department who probably told them to turn tail and cut their losses, doubled-down, and committed to giving us all our long-awaited tendies.

As important as making money is, we have to remind the people at Wall Street that we are not like them - we are not money hoarding people. Let's spread the wealth and help charities out, which probably need it more than ever because of the pandemic.

Even just donating 10% of your money will make a huge difference. If you're unsure what you want to donate to, consider donating to something that you care about, or an autism charity (you know why).

Charity Navigator helps you find tons of charities that are highly rated (Use most of their money for their cause, etc). Note: DO NOT DONATE TO AUTISM SPEAKS. They have a long track record of disrespecting those with autism and are generally just a shitty company.

**EDIT: A lot of common people are in need right now and are not able to pay for things they need, so going on GoFundMe and even donating 10-25 dollars can really help someone out.**

1-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

2-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh fucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

3-Melvin fucked up with this whole situation, but these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and professional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win. If you keep selling, they can slowly cover over time while keeping the price steady.

This afternoon is probably going to be a rough one to stare at the charts. These greedy fucks are about to get pounded and they know it. There will most likely be another short ladder attack this afternoon to drive the price down. As others have said, if we stay above $115 and $60, we are dancing when those calls are exercised. 

This squeeze is not going to be an Instant thing. It won't hit close and shoot to $10,000. It will be a bleed over the weekend and into next week. If you can't handle the volatility, stop looking at the charts constantly. Your shares will still be there when you come back. Enjoy the weekend, go outside, jerk off, I don't give a shit what you do. I will probably set a $120 buy order just in case I can scoop some more shares on the cheap. If you have fucking calls, please for the love of God, manage them before close. I would not be surprised if the brokerages do some more shady shit.

Institutional Ownership of GME is well over 100%. How do shorts cover?,282,l7xrab,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xrab/institutional_ownership_of_gme_is_well_over_100/,113,1611968569.0,"Per https://fintel.io/so/us/gme, it seems that the institutional ownership of GME is at ~160%. 

The largest shareholders are

1	FMR LLC	17.63

2	BlackRock Inc.	13.20

3	RC Ventures LLC	12.90

4	DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP	10.81

5	VANGUARD GROUP INC	8.37

6	STATE STREET CORP	5.84

7	Senvest Management, LLC	5.54

11	Permit Capital, LLC	4.79

12	Scion Asset Management, LLC	4.30

13	ROYCE & ASSOCIATES LP	2.29

Total institutional ownership in just the top 13 companies: 100.85%

This isn't counting the board of directors either. So unless a *lot* of institutional people sell, the shorts *cannot* cover. Add that to the *millions* of shares in call options expiring ITM today, there are going to be millions of shares bought and *delivered* on Monday/Tuesday. Not sold on those days, delivered. That is just buying pressure.

Additionally, according to S3 Partners LLC, Open Short interest as of this morning is still 58MM shares. https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20

TL;DR: There are more institutional shares than total shares while Short interest is 113% of float.

EDIT: It's important to consider that some of these institutional owners could have rebalanced, or exited their positions entirely. For instance, yesterday Must Asset Management disclosed that they sold all their GME shares on 12/31/20. So there can be a month delay in the reporting.",2021-01-30 03:02:49

In order to rebuff an attack there needs to be enough buying at that price to counteract the momentum of the attack. I’ve set a limit buy order at $320 for what I can afford. If you’re looking for a good entry point, this is it. This is a huge battle in the war of GME.

If you currently are holding ITM options for GME and have the funds to exercise: DO IT!!!! Especially if they’re fringe, a short attack or another round of cheating could make them useless any second.

Worst case scenario there is also a large volume of puts at $300, and an even larger volume at $115. If $320 is too high consider $300 or even $115, if they’re able to close those out it’s a huge loss for us.

A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,29187,l7xj5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/,1581,1611968061.0,"There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions.",2021-01-30 02:54:21

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours. In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong. I suspect we'll learn some of the truth years from now when some investigative journalist writes a book about it.*

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis. I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language). The last two posts might be impressive, but you should follow it in chronological order and pay attention to the evolution of sentiment in the comments to experience [true enlightenment](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/posts/).

Anyway, I apologize, but this post will be very long--there's just a lot to unpack.

Pre-Market

Disclaimer: given yesterday's pre-market action I didn't even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre-market. I'm less confident in my ability to read what's going on in a historical chart vs the feel I get watching live, but I'll try.

Early in the pre-market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit, discounting the probability that the short-side will give them a deep discount later, which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday. If they're right they can sell some small volume into the pre-market top, wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down, and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip. Buy-side here look to me like people FOMOing and YOLOing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz, or what looks to be market history in the making. No way are short-side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices.

[Mark Cuban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZZnVs-KM4)\--well said! Free markets baby!

Mohamed El-Erian is money in the bank as always. ""upgrade in quality"" on the pandemic drop was the best, clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic, and boy did it print. Your identifying the bubble as the excessive short (vs blaming retail activity) is [money yet again](https://youtu.be/Gxan42tXhbo?t=164). Also, The PAIN TRADE (sorry, later interview segment I only have on DVR, couldn't find on youtube--maybe someone else can)!

The short attack starts, but I'm hoping no one was panicking this time--we've seen it before. Looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open.

CNBC, please get a good market technician to explain the market action. Buy-side dominance, sell-side share availability evaporating into nothing (look at day-by-day volume last few days), this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass. There is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it (woops, I guess I should have knocked on wood there).

If you know the mechanics, what's happening in the market with GME is not mysterious AT ALL. I feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early ""for their own good"" (with all sincerity, to your credit) rather than explain what's happening. Possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling/encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately (possibly fair point, but at least come out and say that if that's the case). Outside the market, however...wow.

You Thought Yesterday Was Fear? THIS is Fear!

Ok short-side people, my hat is off to you. Just when I thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion, you went and took it to 11. What's even better? Yelling fire in a theater with only one exit. That way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties. Absolutely brilliant.

Robin Hood disables buying of GME, AMC, and a few of the other WSB favorites. Other brokerages do the same. Even for people on 0% margin. Man, and here I thought I had seen it all yesterday.

*Side note: I will give a shout out to TD Ameritrade. You guys got erroneously lumped together with RH during an early CNBC segment, but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week. No one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention. And you didn't stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time. My account balance thanks you. I heard others may have had problems, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt given the DDOS attacks that were flyiing around*

Robin Hood. Seriously WTF. I'm sure it was TOTALLY coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape, what looked like a DDOS attack on Reddit's CDN infrastructure (pretty certain it was the CDN because other stuff got taken out at the same time too), and a flood of bots hit social media (ok, short-side, this last one is getting old).

Taking out a large-scale cloud CDN is real big boy stuff though, so I wouldn't entirely rule out nation state type action--those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest.

Anyway, at this point, as the market dives, I have to admit I was worried for a moment. Not that somehow the short-side would win (hah! the long-side whales in the pond know what's up), but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action. That concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide. But first...

**A side lesson on market orders**

Someone printed bonus bank big time (and someone lost--I feel your pain, whoever you are).

During the face-ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of 7 figures. It took me a second to realize it, then another second to process it. Then, as soon as it clicked, that one, glorious moment in time was gone.

What happened?

During the insane chop of the short ladder attack, someone decided to sweep the 29 Jan 21 115 Call contracts, but they couldn't get a grip on the price, which was going coast to coast as IV blew up and the price was being slammed around. So whoever was trying to buy said ""F it, MARKET ORDER"" (i.e. buy up to $X,XXX,XXX worth of contracts at any price). This is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all/most of the contracts on offer (HFT shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders, which is far safer, but something only near-market compute resources can do really well). For retail, or old-tech pros, if you want all the contracts quickly, you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get... BUT, some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of... $4,400, or something around that. I was too stunned to grab a screencap. The buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious, nigh-obscene backstop limit. So someone got nearly $440,000 PER CONTRACT that was, at the time theoretically priced at around $15,000. $425,000 loss... PER CONTRACT. Maybe I'm not giving the buyer enough credit.. you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first, but, especially in low liquidity environments, if a HFT can peak into your order flow (or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring), they can end up front running your sweep, pick off the reasonable contracts, and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange. Either way, I hope that sweep wasn't loaded for bear into the millions. If so... OUCH. Someone got cleaned out.

So, the lesson here folks... in a super high volatility, low-liquidity market, a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find, and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot. And someone did. If you're on the winning side, great. It can basically bankrupt you if you're on the losing side. My recommendation: Just don't try it. I wouldn't be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this, but no way to know (normally that's crazy-type talk, but after today....peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest, most financially devastating ways to bleed big long-side players, just sayin').

Back to the market action..

A Ray of Light Through the Darkness

So I was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons.

On the one hand, I was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip (I'll admit, I FOMO'd in too early, unnecessarily raising my cost basis).

On the other hand, I was worried for the retail people on Robin Hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options: Watch the slide, or bail. All while dealing with what looked to me like a broad-based cloud CDN outage as they tried to get info from WSB HQ, and wondering if the insta-flood of bot messages were actually real people this time, and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag.

But I saw the retail flag flying high on the 3rd market halt (IIRC), and I knew most would be ok. What did I see, you ask? Why, the glorious $211.00 / **$5,000** bid/ask spread. WSB Reddit is down? Those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape. I've been asked many times in the last few hours about why I was so sure shorts weren't covering on the down move. THIS is how I knew. For sure. It's in the market data itself.

I'll admit, I tried to one-up those bros with a 4206.90 limit sell order, but it never made it through. I'm impressed that the HFT guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been, and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on I'm sure others tried the same thing. Occasionally $1,000 and other high-dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on, which told me the long-side HFTs were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly.

So, translating for those of you who found that confusing. First, such a high ask is basically a FU to the short-side (who, as you remember, need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions). More importantly, as an indicator of retail sentiment, it meant that NO ONE ELSE WAS TRYING TO SELL AT ANY PRICE LOWER THAN $5,000. Absolutely no one was bailing out.

I laughed for a minute, then started getting a little worried. Holy cow.. NO retail selling into the fear? How are they resisting that kind of price move??

The answer, as we all know now... they weren't afraid... they weren't even worried. They were F\*CKING PISSED.

Meanwhile the momentum guys and long-side HFTs keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short-side are plowing into their ladder attack. Lots of HFT duels going on as long-side HFTs try to intercept shares meant to travel between short-side HFT accounts for their ladder. You can tell when you see prices like $227.0001 constantly flying across the tape. Retail can't even attempt to enter an order like that--those are for the big boys with privileged low-latency access.

The fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short-side people.

Why, you ask? Because it means liquidity is drying up, and fast.

The Liquidity Tide is Flowing Out Quickly. Who's Naked (short)?

Market technicals time. I still wish this sub would allow pictures so I could throw up a chart, but I guess a table will do fine.

DateVolumePrice at US Market CloseFriday, 1/22/21197,157,196$65.01Monday, 1/25/21177,874,00$76.79Tuesday, 1/26/21178,587,974$147.98Wednesday, 1/27/2193,396,666$347.51Thursday, 1/28/2158,815,805$193.60

What do I see? I see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near-exchange compute power in the world won't let the short-side HFTs maintain order flow volume for their attacks. Many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading. Nope--it was just the craziest.

What about the price dropping on Thursday? Is that a sign that the short-side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than Wednesday? Is the long side running out of capital?

Nope. It means the short-side hedge funds are just about finished.

But wait, I thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out? How is it that price being lower is bad for them? Won't that allow them to cover at a lower price?

No, the volume is so low that they can't cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly. Just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices (especially when WSB keeps flashing you 6942.00s).

It's true, a higher price hurts, but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point. The only tick that will REALLY count is the last tick of trading on Friday.

In the meantime, the price drop (and watching the sparring in real time) tells me that the long-side whales and their HFT quants are so certain of the squeeze that they're no longer worried AT ALL about whether it will happen, and they aren't even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore.

Instead, they're now really, really worried about how CHEAPLY they can make it happen.

They are wondering if they can't edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow-out trade for the history books (probably). You see, to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares. It doesn't matter what those shares cost. If you're certain that the squeeze is now locked in, why push the price up and pay more than you have to? Just keep pressing hard enough to force short-side to keep sending those tasty shares your way, but not so much you move the price. Short-side realizes this and doesn't try to drive price down too aggressively. They can't afford to let price run away, so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage, but they don't want to push down too hard and give the long-side HFTs too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster. That dynamic keeps price within a narrow (for GME today, anyway) trading range for the rest of the day into the close.

Good plan guys, but those after market people are pushing the price up again. Damnit WSB bros and Euros, you're costing those poor long-side whales their extra 0.0000001% of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets... See, that's the kind of nonsense that just validates [Lee Cooperman's](https://youtu.be/mI-nItz56Fs?t=279) concerns.

On a totally unrelated note, I have to say that I appreciate the shift in CNBC's reporting. Much more thoughtful and informed. Just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible. A lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them. And they're worried that you guys look confused and worried--and if the experts on the news are worried....??!

You should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at, who can explain it to us unwashed masses.

Ok, So.. Questions

**There is no market justification for this. How can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly??** *(side note: not that that should matter--if you want to throw your money away why shouldn't you be allowed to?)*

We're not trading in your securities pricing model. This isn't irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing. The model is not a real market. There is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have, and possibly all the money their brokers have, and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too! You may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow. But the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented. Remember? That's what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero. Remember what you told the KBIO short-squeezed people? They had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk, including more than your initial investment. You guys know this. It's literally part of your job to know this.

But-but-the systemic risk!! This is Madness!

...Madness?

THIS. IS. **THE MARKET!!! \*Retail kicks the short-side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole\***.

Ok, seriously though, that is actually a fundamentally sound, and properly profit-driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds' justification for going >100% of float short. If they can be allowed to gamble INFINITE LOSSES because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt, can't others do the inverse on the possibility the company I don't know.. doesn't go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a $43bn market cap company (CHWY) that does exactly some of the things GME needs to do (digital revenue growth) maybe? I mean, I first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the 30s and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no-brainer momentum trade. The squeeze is just, as WSB people might say, tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus.

I get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of GME. Great. Isn't that what makes a market?

Regarding the consequences of a squeeze, in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex-market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market. I mean, they handled the VW thing somehow right? I see now that I just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though--those guys are so hardcore (I'll explain why I think so a bit lower down).

**If hedge fund people are so hardcore, how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade they're talking about?**

Because it's an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered. And the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in GME. In fact, the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything. They just dug themselves right in there. Kind of impressive really, in a weird way.

What does the short side need to cover? They need the price to be low, and they need to buy shares.

How does price move lower? You have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down (man, I knew econ 101 would come in handy someday).

But wait... if you have to sell shares to push the price down.. won't you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover?

The trick is you have to push price down so hard, so fast, so unpredictably, that you SCARE OTHER PEOPLE into selling their shares too, because they're scared of taking losses. Their sales help push the price down for free! and then you scoop them up at discount price! Also, there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses, when you get right down to it. So, you know, you just need to get really, really, really good at making people scared. Remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right.

On the other hand..

What does the long side need to do? They need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on. And then they need to hold on to them. They can't be weak hands either. They need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle, and the immense pressure of mind-numbing fear... they need to be as if they were made of... diamond... (oh wow, maybe those WSB people kind of have a point here).

Why does this matter? Because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow. They simply won't be there, because they'll be safely tucked away in the long-side's accounts. Once you run out of shares to borrow and sell, you have no way to move the price anymore. You can't just drop a fat stack--excuse me, I mean suitcase (we're talking hedge fund money here after all)--of Benjamins on the ticker tape directly. Only shares. No more shares, no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever.

Ok, doesn't that just mean trading stops? Can't you just out-wait the long side then?

Well, you could.. until someone on the long side puts 1 share up on a 69420 ask, and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a Friday. Let's just say it gets really bad at that point.

Ok.. but how do the retail people actually get paid?

Well, to be quite honest, it's entirely up to each of them individually. You've seen the volumes being thrown around the past week+. I guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow. If they choose to, and time it well. Or they could lose it all--this is the market. Some of them apparently seem to have some plan, or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out. Maybe it works out, but maybe not. There will be financial casualties on the field for sure--this is the bare-knuckled capitalist jungle after all, remember? But everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow, so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else. In theory, anyway.

And now, Probably the #1 question I've been asked on all of these posts has been: **So what happens next?** Do we get the infinity squeeze? Do the hedge funds go down?

Great questions. I don't know. No one does. That's what I've said every time, but I get that's a frustrating answer, so I'll write a bit more and speculate further. Please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation I wouldn't normally put in a post.

The Market and the Economy. Main Street, Wall Street, and Washington

The pandemic has hurt so many people that it's hard to comprehend. Honestly, I don't even pretend to be able to. I have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all. Honestly, it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine (or better than fine, looking at my IRA) versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever-widening divide that, let's be honest, has been growing wider since long before the pandemic.

People on the other side--who have been told they cannot work even if they want to, who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all, are wondering if they're even living in the same reality.

Because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs, or some amazing tech stocks have 10x'd in the last 6 months. How can that be happening during a pandemic? Because The Market is not The Economy. The Market looks forward to that brighter future that Economy types just need to wait for. Don't worry--it'll be here sometime before the end of the year. We think. We're making money on that assumption right now, anyway. Oh, by the way, if you're in The Market, you get to get richer as a minor, unearned side-effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic.

Wow. That sounds amazing. How do I get to part of that world?

Retail fintech, baby. Physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment, but stocks will do. I can even buy fractional shares of BRK/A LOL.

Finally, I can trade for my own slice of heaven, watching that balance go up (and up--go stonks!!). Now I too get to dream the dream. I get to feel connected to that mythical world, The Market, rather than being stuck in the plain old Economy. Sure, I might blow up my account, but that's because it's the jungle. Bare-knuckled, big league capitalism going on right here, and at least I get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else. At least I'm playing the same game. Everyone has to start somewhere--at least now I get to start, even if I have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times. I've basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before. This is number on a screen going to 0 is nothing.

Laugh or cry, right? I'll post my losses on WSB and at least get some laughs.

Geez, some of the people here are making bank. I better learn from them and see if they'll let me in on their trades. Wow... this actually might work. I don't understand yet, but I trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade. I don't understand it, but all the memes say it's going to be big.

...WOW... I can pay off my credit card with this number. Do I punch out now? No? Hold?... Ok, getting nervous watching the number go down but I trust you freaks. We're still in the jungle, but at least I'm in with with my posse now. Market open tomorrow--we ride the rocket baby! And if it goes down, at least I'm going down with my crew. At least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious I'll forget to cry.

Wow.. I can't believe it... we might actually pull this off. Laugh at us now, ""pros""!

We're in The Market now, and Market rules tell us what is going to happen. We're getting all that hedge fund money Right? Right?

Maybe.

First, I say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears. Secondly, because the rules of The Market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume. We are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair. The Market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal The Market is supposed to be. This is the version of the market I make my trading decisions in. However, the Real Market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges, when things are taken to extremes, or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point, or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the Real Market get stretched. GME ticks basically all of those boxes, which is why so many people are getting nervous (aside from the crazy money they might lose). It's also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself. Because it's money, and people really, really, really like their money--especially when they're used to having a lot of it, and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more... flexible, shall we say.

Ok, back to GME. If this situation with GME is allowed to play out to its conclusion in The Market, we'll see what happens. I think all the long-side people get the chance to be paid (what, I'm not sure--and remember, you have to actually sell your position at some point or it's all still just numbers on your screen), but no one knows for certain.

But this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of The Market and back into The Economy.

Geez, and here I thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldn't ever have to think and worry about that thing again.

Unfortunately, while he's kind of a buzzkill, [Thomas Petterfy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) has a point. This could be a serious problem.

It might blow out The Market, which will definitely crap on The Economy, which as we all know from hard experience, will seriously crush Main Street.

If it's that big a deal, we may even need Washington to be involved. Once that happens, who knows what to expect.. this kind of scenario being possible is why I've been saying I have no idea how this ends, and no one else does either.

How did we end up in this ridiculous situation? From GAMESTOP?? And it's not Retail's fault the situation is what it is.. why is everyone telling US that we need to back down to save The Market?? What about the short-side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with?? We're just playing by the rules of The Market!!

Well, here are my thoughts, opinions, and some even further speculation... This may be total fantasy land stuff here, but since I keep getting asked I'll share anyway. Just keep that disclaimer in mind.

A Study in Big Finance Power Moves: If you owe the bank $10,000, it's your problem...

What happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back? It's a scary question to have to face personally. Still, on balance and on average, if you're fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking (especially if you're reasonably careful). Lenders can take a risk loaning you money, you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise. Sometimes it doesn't work out. Sometimes it's due to reasons totally beyond your control. In any case, if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off, pick yourself up as best as you can, and try to move on and rebuild. A lot of people had to learn that in 2008. Man that year really sucked.

Wall street learned their lessons too. Most learned what I think most of us would consider the right lessons--lessons about risk management, and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk, concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets, etc. Many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of, shall we say, unhealthy lessons. Also, to try to be completely fair, maybe managing other peoples' money on 10x+ leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement. I could actually, genuinely buy that. I know I make mistakes under pressure even when I'm trading risk capital I could totally lose with no real consequence. Whatever the motive, here's my read on what's happening:

First, remember that as much fun as WSB are making of the short-side hedge fund guys right now, those guys are smart. Scary smart. Keep that in mind.

Next, let's put ourselves in their shoes.

If you're a high-alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a $20bn 10x leveraged to 200bn portfolio, get caught in a bad situation, and are down mark-to-market several hundred million.. what do you do? Do you take your losses and try again next time? Hell no.

You're elite. You don't realize losses--you double down--you can still save this trade no sweat.

But what if that doesn't work out so well and you're in the hole >$2bn? Obvious double down. Need you ask? I'm net up on the rest of my positions (of course), and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here. Speaking of momentum, imagine the move if your friends on TV start hyping the story harder! Genius!

Ok, so that still didn't work... this is now a frigging 7 sigma departure from your modeled risk, and you're now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world, and quickly converging on infinite downside. Holy crap. The fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning--and man, even the broker is freaking out. F'in Elon Musk and his twitter! You're cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to Mars first thing tomorrow... Ok, focus--this might legit impact your total annual return. You need a plan, and you know the smartest people on the planet, right? The masters of the universe! Awesome--they've even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook!! Of course! It's obvious now--you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning. So simple. Sticky note that Mars trip cancellation so you don't forget.

Ok... so that didn't work? You even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too. Ah well, that was a long shot anyway. So where were you? Oh yeah.. if shenanigans don't work, skip to page 10...

...Which says, of course, to double down again. Anyone even keeping track anymore? Oh, S3 says it's $40bn and we're going parabolic? Man, that chart gives me goosebumps. All according to plan...

***So what happens tomorrow? One possible outcome of PURE FANTASTIC SPECULATION...***

End of the week--phew. Never though it'd come. Where are you at now?... Over $9000\*!!! Wow. You did it boys, and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet.

\**side note: add 8 zeros to the end...*

Awesome--your problems have been solved. Because...

Just heard Senate Majority Leader is working with democratic senators and some Republicans on crafting a federal cannabis reform bill. This is huge. The senate has been the barrier, and now the majority leader is onboarding change in cannabis. News just coming out, dont know how long i'll hold for but this is fresh and $apha is undervalued.

Some simple maths.

Post merger $TLRY & $APHA (remember they keep the $tlry name, and $apha gets some .83 $tlry per share of $apha)

if $TLRY is worth $24 post merger, that puts its Market cap at about $10 Billion, thats on par with CGC.

if $TLRY is @ $24...then take $24x.83=$19.92ish per share of $APHA post merger.

if $APHA is @ current prices of about $13...then take $13/.83=$15.66 per $TLRY x approximately 420m(nice) shares post merger = 6.5 Billion market cap...the largest cannabis company in the world worth 65% of $CGC?? IMO that'd be highly undervalued.

if $CGC is worth 10 billion on anticipation of change in US laws, I imagine at the MINIMUM the new Tilray would be worth the same.

&#x200B;

and finally my $12 calls running me at 14.46 breakeven for $APHA...$14.46/.83=$17.42 post merger value.

I haven't all-in'd but I very much want to spread the love for all these great cannabis companies. I'm holding back because the market is pretty volatile right now, and if theres a dip, I'd like an ever better average.

&#x200B;

Edit: $CGC market cap is wrong my bad, using my old maths on it. @ $41 its valued at 15 Billion... If i value the new $TLRY like $CGC, which I do, that would put $TLRY post merger price more about $36 and $APHA would be valued closer to 29.80\~. I like this stock",2021-01-30 02:37:29

Watching this video makes my blood fucking boil. Bill Galvin's comments perfectly embody the boomer/legacy financial mentality about this whole issue. I think we are doing a good job of discussing this but theres one concept here that I really want to unpack.

Bill (his mommy calls him William) keeps referencing how this is all just speculation with no basis in rational valuation, etc. He is explicitly saying that is bad for the economy and dishonest. Ok Bill, institutional market participants trade based on technicals, momentum, and a whole host of other inputs that have nothing to do with valuation in any sense and you didn't seem to have a problem when they were doing it....

The point here is that market participants can buy and sell securities based on whatever fucking thesis they have whether its because they actually did a boomer DCF or maybe they just like the name of the company. For them to come out and basically imply that trading is only acceptable, ethical, ""good""(whatever the fuck that means) if it is based on rational valuations theory is fucking absurd and dangerous.

We are the check and balance in the market. If people want to lose money thats their fucking prerogative...we signed the disclaimers. Trading purely on technicals is fucking great. Trading on momentum is amazing. Trading because your wife's boyfriend recommended some hype stock is the best. This was a genius trade thesis based on an in-depth understanding of market mechanics and market structure -- large institutions are exploiting these sorts of liquidity dislocations (with no basis on valuation) on a daily basis at scales 10 times the magnitude.

Fuck this guy. Fuck what he stands for. Fuck his point of view.

WHY BROKERAGES SHUT DOWN BUYS FOR GME AND OTHERS,248,l7wvz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7wvz1/why_brokerages_shut_down_buys_for_gme_and_others/,76,1611966574.0,"OK, I've watched WeBull CEO interview, read few things here and here is my understanding of the situation. I knew next to nothing about stock market just a month ago, so take it with a grain of salt.

Here is a diagram of roles showing how money exchange hands. These are just roles, some companies act as multiple roles.

                         +------->    DTC     <---------+  
                         |                              |             
    buybroker -> clearing company <=[3 days]=> clearing company -> sellbroker  

When we buy or sell, money don't exchange hands immediately. They go via clearing process, where roughly speaking they just record all transactions, then settle the balance with each other **every 3 days** with a single balancing payment. It is important to understand, that balancing payment is much less than total volume of trade between clearing companies, because on average everyone trades with everyone. For this particular trade 3 day delay means, that sellers clearing company is on the hook: they already paid seller, but real money for this deal will come later.

What if buyers clearing company goes down? Nobody likes to be exposed, so the mechanism of collateral was invented. All clearing companies deposit cash in custodian (DTC) to guarantee that if counterparty goes bankrupt, they are not at loss or at least exposure is calculated upfront and accounted for. It's logical that collateral is calculated in proportion to the expected balancing payment.

When WSB started trading, all expectations were off, all risk models were out of the window. There was a risk that Melvin Capital wont be able to pay for the stocks they are buying or more precisely wont be able to clear 3 days down the line when settlement is due, this in turn would bankrupt other clearing companies on the market, causing cascading effect.

So custodian (DTC), being in a risk management business, decided that GME stocks causes to much risk and demanded 100% collateral . What does it mean in practice? Now suddenly clearing companies need to deposit 100% of **whole GME volume** they are trading, which is much more than what they could afford immediately. They had no option other than to refuse to clear GME trades, which in turned caused RH, WeBull & others to shut buys.

Why European companies continue to trade? I don't know. Maybe their clearing process is much faster (minutes? hours?) and their exposure is much less as a result, so collateral requirements are significantly lower.

this isn't mine

this is not financial advice buy GME 🚀🚀🚀🌕

edit: fixed the diagram

edit 2: Clearing companies wanted higher collateral but this still was suits dictating the rules.

edit 3: CITADEL IS BOTH A HEDGE FUND AND A CLEARING COMPANY SO THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS IN THAT POT AS WELL

edit 4: fellow retard in comment section u/massdev addressed what my post didn't: 

""Problem is with your analysis is that it only fucks buy side which makes no sense because you are getting capital in exchange for paper.

Sell side is the exposure and was allowed to continue because the cunts tried to collude together to exit their worst short positions and shake out paper retail hands with a short ladder.

Melvin’s position being untenable isn’t a cascade or systemic failure as evidenced by they still exist and they are still trying to salvage their position while being propped up by the market makers, clearing houses and platforms.

This isn’t a game for the whole enchilada, by the time regulation, legislation and punitive catches up this will be long over. The naked short selling created the opportunity, that is the root of the problem and that smart money didn’t butcher them shows sharks don’t eat sharks.""",2021-01-30 02:29:34

I remember my brother helping my father count pocket change on our kitchen table. That was all the money he had left in the world. While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protestors. I will never forget that.

My Father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death.

 This is all the money I have and I'd rather lose it all than give them what they need to destroy me. Taking money from me won't hurt me, because i don't value it at all. I'll burn it all down just to spite them.

Congress and media will use Robinhood as the scapegoat but the real issue here is Citadel.  Don’t get me wrong, Robinhood deserves all the shit it’s going to get thrown at. After “the call” with Citadel, Vlad could’ve told them to fuck off, “We built Robinhood for the people.” He could’ve raised margins to 100% for those stocks, something reasonable, but no he caved into Citadel’s request. But destroying Robinhood isn’t going to stop the problem.

For those of you that don’t know, Citadel is a Market Maker. They are literally the definition of Market Manipulation. I’m not going to explain that to you, look it up. All done now? Good we can move on. They make their money selling option contracts. How is that manipulating the market you ask? Well, it is when you have brokers like Robinhood selling you data and you working with shorts keeping prices down. Why else do you think they bailed out Melvin? Connect the dots you autists!

Nothing will happen with them anytime soon because they have paid off everyone that could expose them. Everyone on Wallstreet knows this, everyone in government knows this. Yes even AOC, even fuckin Ted Cruz who’s just clout chasing (His wife’s a top exec at GS, he knows this shit, he knows nothing is going to happen.) AOC hinted of this during her Twitch stream yesterday. Congress has BS committees whose job is to “make money.” They even paid off Janet Yellen. She ain’t no JPow.

Your natural follow up question is “okay how do we stop Citadel if they have so much pull?” The simple answer “buy fuckin TSLA because Elon is papa.” I’m not going to bore you with all the TSLA DD because they’re all over this subreddit and all over twitter. If you fuckin reply with gordon johnson, teslacharts, or mark spiegel, fuck off you really are a retard. The only thing I will touch upon is FSD. Listen to the earnings call. Elon says they’ll start offering FSD subscription in 1-2 months for $200 per month. I’ll do the math for you autists taking into account that only 20% of drivers will pay for that (that’s a lowball number). There’s currently roughly 1 million Teslas on the road capable of FSD.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/)

If you take a 20% FSD take rate of those 1 million Teslas, that’s 480mil revenue yearly just from FSD alone the first year. This is not including the 800k+ deliveries expected this year. By 2025, when there’s roughly 5 million Teslas on the road, FSD revenue will be about 2.4 billion annually.  Don’t listen to all the FUD on how Tesla missed EPS or auto margin % is down. Those analysts are missing the big picture. This is why even Elon himself said Tesla is well worth the 1 trillion valuation

Okay let’s get back on track because those of you who made it here want to know how to expose Citadel. Not only are they a Market Maker, they’re a known Tesla Market Maker.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771](https://www.barrons.com/articles/hedge-fund-citadel-discloses-huge-stake-tesla-stock-51587762771)

They’ve been manipulating the price on Tesla for years. The media have helped make their jobs much easier. Watch CNBC, that’s all the evidence you need. You know who else is short Tesla that connects all of this with GME? You guessed it: Melvin fuckin Capital. 

[https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5](https://lostinthoughtt.medium.com/elon-musk-tweets-about-gme-because-melvin-capital-shorted-tsla-for-years-6d00512080c5)

Where do you think all that money that Citadel is bailing Melvin out with is going to go? Yup shorting Tesla. Who else is going to benefit from that? If you guessed Citadel, come on down and get your free stock. Before I get to my next point, let’s take a look at Tesla short interest.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)

As of 1/15, there is still 56mil shares shorted. That’s a whopping 46-47 billion $ worth of shorts (3x that of GME). To add on to those shorts, there’s also a new “synthetic short” made by Tesla joining the SP500. To summarize for you, there are active funds which track the performance of SP500. At the end of the year, they’re judge by how well they do with respect to the index. A surprising amount of them still do not own Tesla so YTD, they are well behind the index due to not owning any Tesla. A good amount of them are waiting until post Q4 earnings (now) to buy shares thus creating a “synthetic short.”

[https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1344267081018175489?s=20](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1344267081018175489?s=20)

How do we get the ball rolling? The same idea as GME, buy what TSLA you want, force Citadel to start having to buy shares for their calls, get these synthetic shorts to start buying and you can probably guess what happens next. This time, if they decide to pull the same shit, they can’t say they’re “protecting the investor” because Tesla “is” a great investment. Congress and Joe can’t say they’re for climate change if they’re going to choose the likes of Citadel over Tesla. 

With that, I want to end this and remind you again to NOT FUCKIN SELL GME. If you have to take, some profits from the rest of your portfolio. I’m selling everything else in my portfolio and going all in on TSLA and GME.

They led people into thinking they would be able to buy non fractional shares today on Robinhood which I trusted (big mistake) so I didn't open up another brokerage account because it seemed like a hassle. 

All they did was turn the BUY button from grey to green, making you think you had the ability to buy and hoped the spotlight would be taken off of them.

The fact is, the hedge funds know that the majority of people buying GME use Robinhood because it's still the easiest platform to trade on and get started on. All they did to do continue to manipulate the volume was make it slightly harder to buy GME by adding additional steps; first realize you still can't buy GME on RH, then research & find another broker, sign up, fund it, etc., to the less experienced investor these tasks can be a huge turn off simply because of the added steps.

As someone who has studied marketing tactics and psychology I've learned that by adding even 1 additional step to the checkout process you could decrease conversions by more than 15%, think about what adding 5 steps would do. If things aren't easy to do, less people will do it, look at volume today still extremely low relative to the days prior to RH disabling the ability to buy.",2021-01-30 02:23:59

I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

# The Great RobinHood Ass-Covering

*(sources listed at bottom for images & info btw)*

**Pre-cursor Statements:**

* This is sort of a question + hypothetical + little tinfoilery so bear with me regarding RobinHood's ""f*ractional share*"" / ""p*artial stock*"" ownership investing tool (*I'm not sure what they call it*).
* I'm also under the assumption a lot of you purchased these 'partial shares' in an attempt to get in with the GME move.

**The Hypothetical Rambling:**

So let's [look at how many institutions had stakes in GME](https://i.imgur.com/1DA71UK.png) prior to what will most likely go down in history as the most hilarious HF short-covering shitshow of all time. [Even looking through the alphabetical assortment of institutional ownership](https://i.imgur.com/lIfPwV5.png) I don't see anywhere that Robinhood owned GME prior to the reporting date of 12/31/2020. So how is Robinhood able to sell small partitions of an equity / stock without actually owning it? This questions is bugging me, especially [since they claim these fractional shares are pieces of actual whole shares](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/fractional-shares/). So if Robinhood is selling these fractional shares... wouldn't they have to initially own the whole share in order to partition this stock into sublet shares to sell on their platform?

Enter the tinfoil hypothetical - **Robinhood never actually bought the GME stock and just sold the partial shares to investors, effectively creating their own uncovered GME position.** You autists purchased so many GME fractional shares that Robinhood's risk assessment team had a stroke. Combined with the GME shares they handed over on margin, the fact multiple major short-positioned HFs were frantically covering their own ass, and how many ""*whole shares*"" were needed for covering all the sold ""*fractional shares*"", RobinHood had created themselves an environment in which they are getting fucked harder than a mollied-up Kimberly Guilfoyle at an RNC convention. Once the realization set in that RobinHood is potentially on the line for 1,000,000s of uncovered GME shares they had to do something.

Welcome to Thursday 01/28/2021 where Robinhood freezes the sales of GME, strips margin accounts of GME positions, and gets their hands dirty in price manipulation based on the fact they had control over a massive GME purchasing power group. My hypothesis is they used this time to cover their own asses and buy their own shares of GME to close out this magnificent fucking failure of their own investing platform. It's completely possible they are even the reason behind the +100% short interest because they were borrowing already short-sold shares from Citron to sell the margin account GME positions and fractional shares.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Robinhood put themselves in their own short-sold position with GME with fractional shares, possibly margin sales as well, and they halted the GME stock on their platform so they themselves could cover.

This is just speculation and a thought, I'm curious if this holds any weight or could be a realistic situation. What are your thoughts?

**EDIT 1:** Additional note - it's possible they planned to pay out the fractional shares a cash-dollar amount based on performance but then we find ourselves in a darker place. If the partial equity (*fractional share*) was never real in the first place, and the bought + settlement exchange is cash only and detached from an underlying asset... wouldn't this effectively be a Ponzi Scheme?

**EDIT 2: Apparently they aren't allowing people to buy fractional shares anymore on GME** \- this potentially supports my hypothetical.",2021-01-30 02:04:12
DFV talks to the Wall Street Journal,786,l7w856,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7w856/dfv_talks_to_the_wall_street_journal/,90,1611965031.0,"He’s officially famous boys 

https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696?mod=mhp

The investor who helped direct the world’s attention to GameStop, leading a horde of online followers in a bizarre market rally that made and lost fortunes from one day to the next, says he’s just a normal guy.

“I didn’t expect this,” said Keith Gill, 34 years old, known as “DeepF—ingValue” by fans on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum and “Dada” by his 2-year-old daughter. He said he didn’t set out to draw the attention of Congress, the Federal Reserve, hedge funds, the media, trading platforms and hundreds of thousands of investors.

“This story is so much bigger than me,” Mr. Gill told The Wall Street Journal in his first interview since the unboxing this week of a volatile new stock market game. “I support these retail investors, their ability to make a statement.”

To many of them, Mr. Gill—who until recently worked in marketing for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.—is the force behind the triple-digit gains in shares of the videogame retailer GameStop, up more than 900% this year through Thursday. On Wednesday, the stock jumped 135% to $347.51, a record, before plunging to $194 a share Thursday as online brokerages clamped down. At the start of the year, GameStop shares went for around $18.

Many online investors say his advocacy helped turn them into a force powerful enough to cause big losses for established hedge funds and, for the moment, turn the investing world upside down.

Mr. Gill posted a screenshot of his brokerage account Wednesday, showing a roughly $20 million daily gain on GameStop shares and options. “Your steady hand convinced many of us to not only buy, but hold. Your example has literally changed the lives of thousands of ordinary normal people. Seriously thank you. You deserve every penny,” replied one Reddit user, reality_czech.

The next day, Mr. Gill posted another screenshot—showing about a $15 million loss. After Thursday’s market close, his E*Trade brokerage account, viewed by the Journal, held around $33 million, including GameStop stock, options and millions in cash.

“He always liked money,” said Elaine Gill, his mother. As a child, she said, “he would get money from those scratch tickets that people didn’t know they’d won. People would throw them on the ground…A lot of times there was still money on them.”

Mr. Gill’s online persona—he goes by “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube—has drawn tens of thousands of fans and copycats who share screenshots of their own brokerage accounts. As the GameStop frenzy peaked this week, hundreds of thousands of new investors downloaded applications like Robinhood to join the action, according to Apptopia Inc.

Mr. Gill said he wasn’t a rabble-rouser out to take on the establishment, just someone who believes investors can find value in unloved stocks. He never expected to have a legion of fans debating his identity online, or millions of dollars in his trading account, he said. He was just a dad with an online hobby and a plastic kiddie slide on the front lawn of a Boston suburb.

Mr. Gill began investing in GameStop around June 2019, he said, when it was hovering around $5 a share. Earlier that year, the game retailer was hunting for its fifth chief executive in a little over 12 months. Mr. Gill kept buying. Although he never played much besides Super Mario or Donkey Kong, he saw potential for the struggling retailer to reinvigorate itself by attracting new customers with the latest videogame consoles.

“People were doing a quick take, saying GameStop was the next Blockbuster, ” he said, a chain caught in a retail decline. “It appeared many folks just weren’t digging in deeper. It was a gross misclassification of the opportunity.”

Mr. Gill, tall with shoulder-length hair, opened a YouTube channel last summer, and he worked in the basement of the home he rents in Wilmington, Mass., to avoid disturbing his daughter after bedtime, he said. On his channel, he touted GameStop and Belgian beers. His favorite is Delirium Tremens.

On a recent YouTube live-stream, he wore a red headband and aviator sunglasses while fielding questions on stocks. He poured himself Prosecco then switched to beer as he celebrated big gains and gave shout-outs to legions of viewers and traders in a seven-hour-plus extravaganza. The stream has tallied more than 200,000 views.

Mr. Gill’s obscene username on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum is supposed to reflect a belief in value investing—buying shares of companies that are inexpensive relative to the underlying business.

Among his many Reddit fans, Mr. Gill “will go down as the greatest legend in the history of WallStreetBets,” said Jon Hagedorn, a 34-year-old training supervisor based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. “He’s the original OG.”

The stock’s wild ride, seemingly divorced from standard measures of corporate value, has spurred complaints that investors banding together to provoke this kind of frenzy amounts to market manipulation.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it would “act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity.” Mr. Gill said he hasn’t heard from the SEC.

Fast times

“The first thing that I had asked him when this craziness started was: is this illegal or anything dishonest? He said, ‘No mom, it’s not,’” recalled Ms. Gill, who lives in Brockton, Mass., where she and Steve Gill raised their son.

In high school, Mr. Gill was a distance runner, and he earned national honors on the team at nearby Stonehill College, where he graduated in 2009 with an accounting major. He ran a four-minute mile until sidelined by an Achilles injury.

Mr. Gill moved to New Hampshire for a few years and found a mentor, an investor and software developer his aunt introduced him to. He holds a designation as a Chartered Financial Analyst and said he was drawn by the complexity and challenge of stock picking, which became an outlet for the energy he once put into running. He started working at MassMutual in 2019.

In the summer of 2019, he started building his position in GameStop and would post screenshots of his E*Trade account’s options positions on WallStreetBets forum. “Holy s— bro, what made you drop 53K on GameStop?” one trader posted about one of Mr. Gill’s screenshots in September 2019.

In the months that followed, he posted regularly, putting up a “GME YOLO update,” a reference to GameStop’s ticker and the mantra “you only live once.” He showed off gains in the five- and six-digits, and times when his investments plunged.

Mr. Gill stuck with GameStop, and his wagers became day-trader lore.

To fans, he tapped into the desire by millions of amateur investors around the U.S. to try their hand at stock trading. Trading fees have fallen to zero, and apps allow investors to buy and sell on their phones. The easy market access is augmented by an online community swelled with eager helpers.

Many first-time investors stuck at home in the pandemic said they found solace in chatting with others online about trading stocks or options, as well as hearing from those making profitable bets.

The discourse isn’t always positive. An off-Reddit chat room associated with WallStreetBets is filled with obscenity, racism and antigay screeds. Many on the platforms lash out against Wall Street power players, and some express a desire to see the financial pros reel from losses.

“I’m not out for anybody,” Mr. Gill said. “Roaring Kitty was an educational channel where I was showcasing my investment philosophy.”

Bear bust

Many on Wall Street disagreed with Mr. Gill’s bullish view on GameStop and have taken a big hit as a result. Hedge funds and other investment professionals piled into wagers that the shares would tumble.

To bet against a stock, hedge funds borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and return them. That allows them to pocket the difference between the prices. But when a shorted stock stages such a dramatic rally, it turns painful, often forcing them to exit from the positions by purchasing shares at a loss. In turn, that can inspire sharp gains in stocks, known as a “short squeeze.”

The bearish positioning of hedge funds was part of what drew many small GameStop investors, anticipating a short squeeze. Mr. Gill said his investing strategy didn’t entirely depend on a short squeeze, but he knew others were potentially betting on it.

So far, the professionals have been wrong, giving a win to Mr. Gill and other individual investors who bet big on GameStop. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital Management and Maplelane Capital were the ones burned, as well as jeered by boastful Reddit investors.

Many others have piled into GameStop, trying to ride the rally “to the moon,” as many Reddit investors say. Individual investors have also piled into shares of companies like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. in the hopes of catching similar momentum and making a quick buck.

GameStop has garnered hundreds of thousands of posts over the past month across Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, according to data this week from Meltwater, a global media intelligence company. As the stock has vaulted higher, its shares have traded in a frenzy, making it one of the most popular bets in the U.S. market in recent days, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Seasoned traders are starting to take into account the behavior of influential investors like Mr. Gill and others.

Mark Sebastian, founder of Chicago-based Options Pit and an options trader for around 20 years, has developed a screener analyzing reams of stocks to spot those with heavy activity from individual investors. He buys or sells options based on which stocks are gaining momentum, trying to ride the wave higher or lower. Recently, this included AMC, though he said he wasn’t a fan.

“We’re trying to get on these names before they completely take off,” Mr. Sebastian said, calling one recent trade “free money.”

Mr. Gill said his life has changed overnight and hasn’t set his future plans. He would like to continue the “Roaring Kitty” YouTube channel, maybe buy a house. “I thought this trade would be successful,” he said, “but I never expected what happened over the past week.”

He has one dream in mind. “I always wanted to build an indoor track facility or a field house in Brockton,” he said of his hometown. “And now, it looks like I actually could do that.”

Luckily, I haven’t accrued a ton of crippling debt or medical needs yet either.

Yesterday, I told my dad about my positions (literally all GME). He’s always encouraged me to make smart investments, so he was very skeptical.

“Alex, they can find shady ways to get themselves out of this”

“The share is worth $4, please get out in time”

“This almost sounds like a Ponzi scheme”

I heard it all from him. In response, I told him:

“Dad, we can remain retarded longer than they can remain solvent”

I could see his faith in my investments drain from his face.

The mods have made a post explaining much more thoroughly the risks that are actually involved. I recommend everyone [look at it and understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/) just how things can result in everyone getting nothing.

\------------------------------------

First off, I am not a financial advisor and currently hold shares in GME. I stand to gain or lose from this as much as anyone else invested in GME at this time.

I'm seeing a lot of talk about the mind games at play here. The important one to note is that many billionaires and talking heads are making this to be the day that makes or breaks us. This is not true. As explained in several other posts there is still plenty of time for them to cover, and it will take them days to do so. This may not even end next week.

**\*\*DO NOT SELL TODAY\*\***

It's the end of the month. People need to pay rent. Many people have everything they're worth riding on this. They will say and do everything they can today and this weekend to scare you, and make you want to exit with the gains you have. This is one of only many potential plays they have. Here is a list of other things to come:

**\*\*Coordinated downtime of various brokers\*\***

We've already seen this. Be prepared for Robinhood and their window-licking collective to throw their hands in the air and say ""Woops, trade volume crashed our services, sorry kids!"" The upside here is that you can't sell if things are frozen, but they'll tank the price while it's down to make you panic over potential losses and pressure you into selling when the app recovers.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Blatant Lying on Positions\*\***

One of the main resources we have been using to track where we are in all of this is % of float shorted. If people decide to start lying about these numbers there isn't much to stop them. They have the ability to do so, it's on us to confirm with numbers whether or not that's true. If Shitadel/Marvin/Anyone Else decides to start making up numbers they'll try to convince everyone they're already out of their positions. When they do that, the media will start blaring horns about ""Unnatural meme stock prices"". Again, we've already seen this with various shithole news outlets and talking heads.

**\*\*Forced Sell Limits\*\***

Sell limits are important, and to be honest I don't know enough about how they're managed by the algos to say exactly what effects they have on automated services. They're so important, that RH and other brokers are rejecting limit sells at what they consider unreasonable prices. This is also a scare tactic. What happens if things sky rocket but you can't login to make your sell at a real price? Better make it something more reasonable for those big boys in suits to pick up, something under $10k, right?

**Fuck you, HOLD!**

They can't do this forever. Retail holds a very large amount of available shares, and they will need the vast majority, if not all of them, to cover their positions. WE GET TO MAKE THE PRICE. GME GO  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

Realistically, I know there are people here that put in their net worth and don't want to hold forever. 5 shares at $5000, $6000, or even $9000 is life changing money for them. I understand this. But the potential is there for this to go much, much higher. We now hold all of the cards, the chips, the blow, the table, ***AND THE HOUSE!*** They're looking to buy back in. We get to name the price. Don't miss that opportunity.

Once again, I'm just some dude on the internet. Don't use this as financial advice. But also

🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 **GME** 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Bad people are bad. They will lie, they will cheat, they might even steal. They will threaten you. They will scare you. The strongest defense you have is to **HOLD AND KEEP HOLDING!** They are desperate and you are winning.

I genuinely believe in the new business model of Gamestop and wish to see it succeed.

&#x200B;

**-Important Edit-**

You will see posts from people claiming horrible, terrible things happened to their accounts, or were reported by news articles. No matter what the claim, even if they have a screenshot 'confirming', wait for more people to source this and verify. They have joined the masses and are doing their best to spread false information. I speculate some screencaps we've seen have been photoshopped or source edited.

DTCs and Clearinghouses: The Shadiness of Yesterday's Buying Halt,124,l7vyax,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7vyax/dtcs_and_clearinghouses_the_shadiness_of/,29,1611964395.0,"Based on my understanding of the process of delivering money from a completed trade...

You sell your shares for a $10 gain. The clearinghouse has to have that $10 and holds it for up to 2 days, then they transfer the liability to a DTC who also has to have your $10 themselves. Then, that DTC goes to the person buying the shares from you for the $10 you earned. They then deliver that back to the clearinghouse or deliver it directly back to you.

The normal collateral rate that a DTC requires a clearinghouse to have is 2%. They raised it to 100% yesterday. Is that unprecedented? It seems like the SNEAKIEST way the big suits could think to stop us from buying GME and starting the squeeze was to up the collateral to an unreasonable level, knowing that the clearinghouses had no option but to ask brokers to stop letting people buy the stock.

It seems to me that some late night phone calls were made before yesterday to these DTC's to up that collateral requirement, knowing that it makes it way less obvious that something corrupt is going on. WeBulls CEO went on Banzinga yesterday and explained this, but i have seen ZERO coverage of this by CNBC. It is so SHADY that Robinhoods CEO didnt mention this once, yet Webull's CEO has no problem saying this on a small youtube channel.

&#x200B;

Does that sound likely to any of you more advanced/experienced traders?

&#x200B;

WeBull's CEO starts to explains the process around 1:06:20.

You can skip to 1:09:00 for more TLDR info.

Idea - Aggregating different models to track GME short interest,80,l7vxx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7vxx6/idea_aggregating_different_models_to_track_gme/,26,1611964371.0,"The short interest % seems to be a big indicator of when the squeeze is happening. One problem is every sites estimates are different. For example Ortex currently has it at 75%, S3 has 113%, Marketwatch has 120% etc.

I wonder if there'd be any value in creating a model that aggregates the GME short data from a bunch of different models so we can trend it. Even though none are fully accurate, if they all drop around the same time that will be a clear sign that the squeeze is upon us and the tendyman cometh.

Now, I am not nearly enough of an autist to do any coding shit to create this model myself. But if there are any programming wiz giga-autists reading this, let me know if this might be worth pursuing, or maybe its just retarded.

I remember the days when we’d be ridiculed by r/stocks and r/investing for just attempting to post over there. When we had nothing but our shared loss porn to keep us going. When we thought 1ronyman to be our lord and savior. When all was lost in the December Crash. When biotech was the craze. When weed stocks took off and then subsequently fizzled out. When we all doubled down on our Tesla positions in 2018 and lost more than half of it 2019. The road has been long and hard (not as long and hard as my girl’s boyfriend but still) for an autist who’s been fighting the good  fight for 3 years. I can only imagine what it was like in the before days. When market autism was lonely and full of loss. 

Remember, we all came to do one thing. Stop being slaves to the scam that is this global economic system. Support our new brothers and sisters in their pursuit. Teach them what we so painfully had to learn so that they might be better than us.

Apart from holding $GME, we need to have a thread discussing the different brokerages:

- Who didn't betray retail investors

- Who still as of now, allow options / non-margin purchasing of $GME, $AMC, $BB, $NOK, etc... THAT ARE UNRESTRICTED (RH's 5 shares of $GME is still BLATANT manipulation)

- Whose mobile app is decent

- If any brokerages have a lucrative bonus to leave RH

- etc, etc, etc,

Showing wallstreet and the government the power of the individual. Making hedge fund managers, and the government show their real colors about what they care about (money, not you).  Love it. 

The fact that so many people are making money from it at the same time? Love it more. 

GME is at an all time high, which is awesome. But what is to stop someone from short selling NOW? (I know basic trading, but short selling is a bit over my head, so forgive my ignorance.) If someone decided to short sell at the current price, the bottom falls out, and it drops back to single digits- they would make a killing right? 

So, what is to stop wallstreet mofos from doing this? Yeah, we may have screwed them out of some money temporarily, but if they can do the scenario I just outlined, then we are only making them their money back and then some in the long run. 

Also, the cultish attitude of ""say nothing else, just buy GME"" is a little odd, and has an almost wallstreet mentality. As opposed to a WSB *fuck with the system* mentality.

**EDIT**
*Okay. Addendum to the scenario. One learned commenter said the following ""They have shorted already and are running out of money.  But we all will sell eventually.  Be in a couple days/weeks/months,  people will grow bored of this and resell these stocks. GME is basically doomed to go back to $0.50 stocks eventually. So OP wants to know what’s stopping someone from shorting the stocks at their peak, and buying them back when GME does (and it will) plummet back to a reasonable price. I almost guarantee it’ll happen."" 

Given this, what is to stop me, or anyone else in WSB from shorting TODAY? I mean we were the ones who got it to the price it's at, if we sell our shares, then short it, can't you basically make money going both ways? *",2021-01-30 01:34:48

Congratulations and holy fuck to those of you in the GME Squeeze. I was a doubter. I missed the boat entirely, but I bought 3 shares this morning at an average of 334 and I’ll hold to oblivion. Seriously. This 1k means absolutely nothing to me. I went 99.9% cash yesterday and I will hold this last tiny remaining position until it’s a penny or I hit my sell limit at $4200.

Some of you may have seen this post yesterday

I believe this is true. 

This explains the broad market selloff of everything besides squeeze stocks this past week aside from yesterday, and the continued bleed today now that the strategy of forcing the squeezers out by restricting trade seems to have failed. 

I had 20k wiped off my account value in hours the other day. That’s not important because it was house money. What’s important is *what caused that fear* and the answer to that may be: a liquidity crisis. 

What happens if brokers like IBKR and RH fail? If they are forced to admit margin is ineffective, their risk management systems are flawed, and short squeeze scenarios like this reveal that *they do not have the ability to cover the cash that flows through their institutions*? 

What happens if these hedge funds who went naked short get fully liquidated in margin calls *and don’t have the money to back it up?*

Not only are we bound to see a *firestorm* of legislation that could scare the markets, the actual *void* of money that will be created could tank everything. 

What would the impacts be of Robinhood failing? If *everyone* who has their money in the market via RH pulls out because they’re not sure that their broker actually *has* the money to pay them? 

TLDR: If the squeeze gets fully squoze, I am pretty certain the entire market will tank (**with the exception of the squeeze stocks**) Therefore, please keep squeezing, because I want cheap stocks.

Not only, they also put the wrong birthday. So every time I tried to setup a brokerage account, it said I was entering the wrong credentials. 

I called Fidelity and they told me I was going to have to submit a paper application to correct the incorrect birthday. I said I'll do that, but I'll probably try to find someone else, because I'm trying to get my assets out of my Robin Hood account. He asked to put me on hold to see if there was something he could do in the back office. He put me on with someone with the 401k department (he stayed on the line while I talked to her). In the end, she told me I was going to have to do a paper application too. He thanked her for her help and told me to stay on the line so he could see if he could try something else. Best fucking customer service. He helped walk me through creating an account, changed my birthday, and walked me through get a transfer set up for my assets at Robin Hood.  The customer service is such a refresher from the nightmare we've had to deal with with Robin Hood.

I love capitalism. The power of competition. Fuck Robin Hood.

SUPPORT SCHWAB & AMERITRADE FOR NO RESTRICTIONS $SCHW,191,l7uzee,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7uzee/support_schwab_ameritrade_for_no_restrictions_schw/,57,1611962107.0,"**Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity** were the only large brokerages that did not lock out its users and allow massive market manipulation by Citadel.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

We should show some love to $SCHW by the best way possible - buying the fuck out of the stock and transferring over your investments/holdings. I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

We need to send **RobinHood, ETrade** and **Webull** a message by leaving their brokerages in the masses. **We will not tolerate Market Manipulation.** This will be the fastest way to say FUCK YOU to each platform. The upcoming class action lawsuites will decide their fate later.

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Even my girlfriend's boyfriend signed up and asked me for investing advice.

Combine that with all the upset Robinhood, E Trade, WeBull users that will be transferring their investments/holdings to Fidelity/Ameritrade/Schwab next week.

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 16% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week.

Schwab and TD Ameritrade were so overloaded that it was experiencing a slow down over the past few days due to the insane amount of new retail investors and increased usage.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 5.8 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to absolutely destroy upcoming earnings. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Everyone seems to be investing with their tendy money. Just look at last years growth in new accounts. Current Q1 2021 numbers will blow away these registrations to the point that the servers were overloaded the past week with so many registrations. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transfers their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuites as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuites against it and possible liquidity issues?

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** Transfer your money/holdings from your scumbag brokerages into TD Ameritrade/Schwab since it was one of the only brokerages who didn't lock out its users. Combine that with expected next earnings beat thanks to growth in retail users + account transfers. Load up in calls in the process and get rich as we send it to the moon. Fuck RH, WeBull, ETrade. LONG $SCHW and show it some love

$STPK TENDIES 🚀,8,l7uxqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7uxqf/stpk_tendies/,18,1611962009.0,"DD on $STPK

Stem Inc. ($STPK) is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems, network integration, and battery optimization. They brand themselves as ""the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public"" - a lot of buzz words I know but bear with me

First, let's take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works. Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy. In recent years battery storage (and in part renewable energy) hasn't seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs.

This being said, recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial / industrial level. Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it.

https://preview.redd.it/xy2e3iml1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32

While battery storage has improved, it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn't feasible with our global energy infrastructure. Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production.

Ok, so now that we know how it works, what does the market look like?

* All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade
* Over the next decade, the US market is expected to grow at \~45% CAGR and the global market is expected to grow 31% CAGR
* Future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment

https://preview.redd.it/7x98ssvk1yb61.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e525ba6bab348a408ec2b59297d03cbcf5b896

Great, so how is $STPK revolutionizing this space? They are doing so by providing a ""one stop shop"" solution for utility companies. Stem's solution can provide integrations with hardware (batteries) and the grid (network), while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage.

https://preview.redd.it/ljxci0lu3yb61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2728140badcbc979109ce3c895f65d3e6057b26

Their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key.

Interesting, so let's move on to their AI software called Athena. Athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems, collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation, grid power or battery power.

https://preview.redd.it/gdctb7fs1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d3265db7fc1978a56bece0b8cac1385bac36f1

Athena is a HUGE part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary. It is a large part of their moat, as they have 24 issued patents for it (so no competitor can replicate it).

Now, let's move onto their financials. First, it's important to understand they have a hardware and software business

* Increased rev from $17 mil to $33 mil YoY, expected to increase to $147 mil in 2021
* 81% CAGR from 2020-2026
* Gross margins have hovered around 12-18% since 2018 but expected to increase to 40%+ by 2026
* 90% of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts (not pipeline!) -> underpromising and overdelivering
* Software revenue expected to account for 30% of total revenues by 2026
   * $14 mil in 2020 -> $240 mil by 2026

A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward. They need to execute yes, but I'm confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5+ years, and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection. They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially.

Lastly, I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla's valuation is their energy business. Interestingly enough, they actually use batteries from Tesla, Samsung, and Panasonic. Additionally, they have a partnership with Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/0xxgetre2yb61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1046d1c13b9ea7363515171e0986eae45fbd0e

In my opinion, this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space.

TLDR: Stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain. More specifically:

* Large TAM + strong macro tailwinds
   * \~$1.2 trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by 2050
   * Battery storage capacity expected to increase by 25x by 2030
* Market leader with best in class technology
   * 900+ systems operating or contracted with Athena
   * 75% market share in CA BTM storage market, largest in the US
   * First mover AI platform that operates with 40+ utilities, 5 grid operators and over 16MM runtime hours
* Highly visible growth
   * Recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth

We are doing silver squeeze wrong,179,l7uvcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7uvcg/we_are_doing_silver_squeeze_wrong/,81,1611961851.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see from my wsb post history, I am an OG precious metals bull. And I am all for teaching a lesson to silver short sellers and manipulators. They are truly the next level boss compared to those funds, who shorted meme stocks. But dear friends, you are doing wrong if you buy ETFs like SLV or SIVR because **JPM**, by far the biggest manipulator and the biggest power in silver market, **will be on both sides of your trade**. You can read my old simple write up about how this came to be [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/).

TL;DR: JPM is, supposedly, both the biggest shortseller of Comex futures contracts and the custodian of silver on which above-mentioned ETFs are based upon. You can not initiate a short squeeze if the other side’s long position is increasing in value by your own hand.

There’s a high possibility, that those paper ETF obligations are largely speculative and uncovered by actual physical silver. You can see that Comex delivery and generally silver market recipients are mostly ETFs in recent years, who cover their paper positions when they want to. Read the prospects of those ETFs: SLV is not required to immediately purchase physical silver to cover your investments in that instrument, they simply track the price.

**Again, I repeat: do not buy SLV or SIVR** if you are aiming for a short squeeze. That would be exactly like trying to start a short squeeze on GME by sending fees to Melvin Capital.

Instead, if you can, **buy actual silver futures**. Store it in your mothers basement, if you have to. That will make them feel the real pain.

If you absolutely have to buy silver ETF, I suggest going for PSLV by Sprott or similar instruments. They are redeemable for institutions actual physical silver ETF and purchase silver from Canadian Royal Mint, if I’m not mistaken. You can read the prospect [here](https://sprott.com/media/1451/pslv-prospectus-en.pdf).

Full disclosure: not an investment advise. I personally hold no physical silver ETFs, but I am long on numerous silver miners positions (most of which I listed on wsb).

Remember, we are the captain now. Good luck, frenz.

P.S.: funny enough, PSLV is an actual name of Indian rocket. So  🚀  🚀  🚀

Why did Robinhood do it? I think they were embarrassed . . .,85,l7upns,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7upns/why_did_robinhood_do_it_i_think_they_were/,42,1611961495.0,"Like all of us, I was mad as hell when Robinhood blocked buying yesterday.  I started digging into it and the following is what I THINK I know. 


I think that Vlad was SORT OF telling the truth about being beholden to their “clearing house” and that the decision to restrict the buying of certain stocks was based on directives from those guys. (Who “those guys” were is trickier . . . )  

In his [interview]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuCcchMOsKE), Vlad said “As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearing house deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.”
I think that’s largely a true statement.  The SEC does set monetary levels that brokerage firms must maintain in order to continue to do business.  But in this case, there is no evidence that the SEC had anything to do with the trading restrictions, as the interviewer points out.  

So let’s look at the other thing he mentioned--the role clearing houses play.  

The way it works is that a trading app like Robinhood doesn’t actually buy the stocks for you—what they do is provide a link from you, the retail investor, to a clearing house that does the actual buying.  You deposit your cash with the app, place your trade, RH sends it to the clearing house, and you almost instantaneously own your stock.  (I won’t cover options here) From your perspective, you put your money in, buy your stocks, and then you own them.  What happens behind the scenes is a bit more complicated.  Your trading app accepts your money and places an order with the clearing house to buy, or sell, the stock at the price that existed when you placed your order.  The clearing house receives the order and actually buys or sells your stock, then lets your trading app know it went through.  Here’s the tricky part—that process between the app and the clearing house can take up to two days.  Normally, this does not affect the retail investor at all—except during the recent unpleasantness.  

In normal times, the clearing house will require the trading app to prove they have the money to buy the stock, but the trading app only has to show they have 1-2% of the total amount.  So if you place an order to buy a stock for $100, the clearing house requires the trading app to show liquid funds of 1 – 2 dollars before they will agree to process that trade for the app.  Usually this is not a problem—the app has plenty of money to cover the normal volume of trades.  But with the increased interest in stocks such as GME, the volume of trading went up so high that the clearing house demanded that Robinhood have 100% liquidity to cover the volume.  Robinhood did not have that much liquidity (that’s my guess) so they stopped all buying of the affected stocks. 

In the interviews, Vlad said “clearing houseS” – plural – not “clearing house,” singular.  So we must assume they deal with more than one.  

Then I started digging to find out WHO these companies are, and . . . nothing.  The only thing I could find is a [statement from Robinhood]( https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/whats-clearing-by-robinhood/)  in 2018 that they were becoming THEIR OWN clearing house.  

This news was also [covered by CNBC.] (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/robinhood-launches-its-own-trade-clearing-system-as-customer-growth-surges.html)  This states that Robinhood used to use Apex Clearing, which is apparently the biggest one out there, but implied that they would no longer use them.  

Webull CEO Anthony Denier confirmed that THEIR app’s decision to restrict trading WAS because of a directive from Apex. Denier said, “Our clearing firm gave us a call and said we're going to have to stop allowing new opening positions in the three names, AMC, GME, and KOSS.” (https://finance.yahoo.com/video/heres-why-robinhood-restricting-users-173049721.html)   He didn’t mention Apex in that interview, but it is noted [here]( https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/webull-and-public-remove-restrictions-on-memestocks-after-citing-trade-settlement-firm-as-the-cause/).  

What this looks like to me is that Apex jacked up the liquidity requirements for buying in certain stocks—whether this is because of their OWN money issue or their fear of issues on the side of the apps, I don’t know.  But they did lift restrictions eventually.  

So what about Robinhood?  Is Robinhood their own clearing house entirely, or do they do SOME of their own clearing and use another clearing house as well?  I don’t know.  Maybe one of you smart autists can figure this one out.  

My suspicion is that they ARE their own clearing house, as their website states, and that they found themselves in a dicey position, money-wise. This would be very embarrassing for a company like this to admit, I’d think.  Basically, having to say, “We’re not really able to play with the big boys” would make them look weak.  They are trying to blame it on outside entities, but looks like it was just one arm of the company directing another?  

In any case, there are STILL [tough restrictions]( https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) on trading certain stocks.  Your position in GME can be no more than 5 shares TOTAL. 

I opened a new account with Fidelity.  My Robinhood portfolio is going to sit there until the moon is reached as I understand it can take up to two weeks to transfer.  I also heard that Fidelity will cover the transfer fee if you ask them.  

I’d love if anyone can add to this speculation (and obviously please correct me if I got anything wrong!)  Ain’t none of this stuff financial advice—just my own senile ramblings. 

I’m a Grandma with coal hands.  (Better than paper, not quite diamond 😊  But holding my 7 shares 🚀  for now!

EDIT:  tl;dr  I think Robinhood's clearing house (themselves) doesn't have enough money to cover these trades

EDIT AGAIN:  Don't take this as a defense of them--they should have been fucking honest.  And I am not even sure there WASN'T collusion with Citadel Securities--but that's a deeper dig.

i know that we are living through a moment of shared euphoria and it is easy to get caught up in it. by all rights i should be asleep by now. but i want to point out how fast this is happening, and how incredibly complex the relations associated with it are. the white house is watching wsb, it's getting front page news coverage worldwide. u/deepfuckingvalue is worth fifty million fucking dollars and is still holding. i have acquaintances and friends i have never spoken to about investing or stocks before messaging me to ask me about gme or amc or bb.

the point i am trying to make is that although we have seen stocks [rocket emoji] before, and although wsb has sometimes gotten fleeting references in say the financial times or the wall street journal, the last seventy-two hours has completely ushered in a new era for wsb. we as a collective entity have broached the mainstream consciousness.

we all know this. my post pertains to how we can use it to our advantage.

my fear is that the casuals are going to lose their nerve and start selling. it is imperative that wsb sends out a message to buy and hold gme, amc and bb (and nok if you're into it, it's 2021, nobody minds what you're attracted to anymore buddy). panic selling because of increased pressure on wsb is not an option. allowing mainstream media to act as propaganda mouthpieces for hedge funds and investment managers cannot be stopped, but it can be proactively countered.

we are seeing historical levels of market participation by people who have never before been a part of the market. if we can convince them to keep constant and hold, prices could skyrocket higher and faster than we have ever seen in recorded history.

When the pandemic started and stores everywhere were slowly closing down I was frequenting my local GameStop a couple times a week for about a month because all these different sales would pop up and I wanted to grab a few things while they were cheap. I got along with the dude that worked there.,142,l7ud2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7ud2r/when_the_pandemic_started_and_stores_everywhere/,9,1611960702.0,"He was practically the only person I ever saw in there, I assume because hours were getting cut and whatnot. 

Anyway, we would have conversations about videogames we both liked and would talk about the craziness of the pandemic. This guy was just a regular employee working the register and keeping the inventory displayed nicely around the store. He was super passionate about videogames in general and we had some good convos about games from the past and how they changed and evolved the industry and new stuff coming out and so forth and so on.

One of the last times I was in there before they shut the doors and started doing online order pickups only things were looking pretty grim and I asked him what he thought about GameStop possibly closing and disappearing from the videogame market landscape, we had both expressed how overpricing products and giving people super low amounts of cash for trading in games was pretty lame and just generally not cool of GameStop prior to this so his answer kind of surprised me...

When I finally brought up GameStop closing he looked me dead in the eyes and said with sincere passion; (almost verbatim) ""this job has literally been my dream since I was a kid, if this place goes down in flames I'm going down with it, I fucking love working here.""

I remember this cause it always stuck out to me, like, damn its just a GameStop, but i guess I can understand how this dude really loves his job especially if you are into videogames in a big way. Good for him. I haven't thought much about what he said there until this week.

I mention this because it truly is shameful what these people were trying to do by playing the market and shorting and squeezing GameStop out of existence and destroying X amount of people's jobs and livelihoods. I got blocked from buying GME yesterday morning when the purchases I made late into the previous night (Wednesday) on Robinhood were cancelled right as the market opened on Thursday morning at 9:30am. I really wanted to be a part of it, not for any personal gain but a deliberate loss just to try and teach the hedge funds and every other wall street homewrecker a lesson.

It's a bit late into the game now and i'll still try to buy GME once i get approved by a company that lets me actually buy the stock, but for now I just wanna say I appreciate everyone who has been able to get involved and is holding the stock for reasons other than personal gain. You have mine and most of the world's utmost respect and admiration for what you're doing and I hope you are all able to make a difference with the game that is being played right now between the rich and the poor.

Just wanted to share that.

Short seller ladder attacks - an ELI5 explanation,273,l7ud1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7ud1x/short_seller_ladder_attacks_an_eli5_explanation/,19,1611960700.0,"Short-seller ladder attacks 

Yesterday the shorts planned an attack which saw the share price plummet. This was on paper only. in reality, there was no buying or selling of many shares, it was just smoke and mirrors.

It is just hedge funds selling non-existent shares to each other at lower and lower bid prices.

example: I have a Toyota to sell for $20,000. There are two guys that need to buy a car. They talk to each other in front of me and Person 1 says to Person 2, ""I will sell you my Toyota for $10,000. His car is too expensive"". This car does not exist. They make an agreement on a non-existent car in front of me. An hour later they come back and then Person 2 says that he will sell the Toyota back to person 1 for $5,000.

Now a non-existent Toyota appears to have changed hands between these two people and the market would think that from seeing this exchange that the car is only worth $5,000, rather than the $20,000 I want to sell it for.

Now I have two choices. I can fall for their trick and think to myself, ""Hmm, maybe my car is not actually worth $20,000 and I should just sell it for $5,000, because that is what the market is saying it is worth"".

OR, I can see through these fake tricks and see that in reality, these two idiots are trying to trick me into selling them something valuable for 1/4 the price.

Yesterday this is what happened on the share market, to GME shares, instead of the Toyota.

They want us to sell for very cheap because they manipulated the market to deceive us.

BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW IS THAT WE CAN SEE THROUGH THEIR LIES, WE KNOW THEIR GAME AND THEY NEED THESE SHARES MORE THAN A THIRSTY PERSON IN THE DESERT NEEDS WATER.

Well guess what, the SEC didn’t do a fucking thing and now yesterday clearing firms decided to limit trading on gamestop because they were having even more failure to deliver issues.

Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares  being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We  retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a  LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly changed the rules ""to protect""  us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory  authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other  actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the  number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.

GPRO - Let it RUN!,2,l7ubic,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7ubic/gpro_let_it_run/,28,1611960599.0,"Posting another DD on GPRO from a financial perspective. I know words are hard for you retards so maybe numbers will help.

GoPro’s revenue is expected to be \~$1B for ’20 (slight decline admittedly but that’s due to COVID) which means their market cap is currently only 1.4x their revenues. That is dirt cheap.

I don’t think PE is appropriate for this stock so let’s look at FCF. As mentioned in my original post \[Link\], GoPro is expected to generate \~$100M of revenue from the subscriptions @ 50% margin is $50M. That along with its camera sales should get it around \~$100M of FCF. This means the company is only trading around 14x FCF!!!

Taking a look at just one competitor (Garmin: GRMN) they are trading at 40x FCF. Not a clean competitor but a competitor still.

They also rolled their debt at a lower interest rate. If the outlook for the company truly got worse, despite decreasing rates, the debt price would not have really changed. They’re turning a corner.

Don’t sleep on this one.

TLDR: GoPro makes cameras and generates cash 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀

"Pernicious Investment Corporations and Boomer Money, The Inside Scoop!",65,l7trd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7trd5/pernicious_investment_corporations_and_boomer/,31,1611959126.0,"We have seen all manner of perfidy coming from the MM while pushing their buttons with GameStop. Something has happened here\~\~some of us have great insight into exactly what has taken place. The big question at this point will be: is there going to be the full-scale investigation into these big firms, and the way they manage money, that we deserve? And--once becoming aware of the consequences of their perfidy--will we have the guts to shut them down and face the consequences that they've been holding over our heads this whole time?  


Here's the case for why society is going to want to pull curtains over the whole thing from here:  
These big investment firms--like Citadel--have all of this entrenched legal power. They control all of the inside aspects of the market economy; they trade around retail, they don't pay taxes. They scalp bits of money from all different corners of the marketplace. They are quite literally, parasites on our civilization. And\~\~here's the kicker: they're playing with boomer money.  


From what I can infer, as long as these companies' bottom lines haven't been breached, they're able to leverage all of their equity however they want--but they have a top line, too! This past week, we've seen the market come down as a whole--just a little bit--because these big firms had to take money out of the game to pay off their top line balance.  


Now--here's the big question: do these companies, shorting GameStop, have to cover their shorts tonight? I'm sure you've all seen the post by zerohedge--120% short float, 2.1 days to cover. What does this mean? Does it mean what we think it will mean?

What it seems to suggest is that they have until MIDNIGHT, TONIGHT, to pay off their shorts\~\~so, here's where things get interesting... Their goal, then, is to keep GME as low as possible, so that--tricky, tricky--they can cover their shorts \*after hours\*. Yeah--they don't want you to have that MOASS...  


So\~\~what's the MM's plan? Well, this would be it, if I were to guess...  
Manipulate the market today, by limiting the calls / puts they sell you, to try to buy up as many calls dated for next week as possible, and as many puts as possible. Going into after hours, they will--probably in some dark black pool that we won't even notice--pay down their covers--resulting in a massive squeeze come Monday morning, where the price will have skyrocketed\~\~1,800/share, I don't know\~\~and, woah! There will be a rush to cash in on those calls! But... Low and behold--you can't. Why? Because the MM control your broker. Then, the price crashes. Shit! You couldn't do anything about it! They sell all of those shares they covered, and cash in on their puts...  


So--this is clearly illegal, and these people deserve to face the consequences of their actions, right?  


Well--not so fast, there, cowboy. Because if they do have to pay up, that means they're going to have to liquidate their equity...  


Give you a second to think about that...  


What does that mean..?  


It means they're going to dig into the boomer's retirement 401k's to pay out. Oh--so what? It's only a few hundred billion or so, or whatever, right? What harm could it do to the economy? Well--consider this... The mass retirement age of the boomer population is in 2022.

Did you think that the market would want to keep their money in the market to give boomer's a nice retirement?.. Absolutely not. The MM plan on divesting from the stock market before boomers start cashing out\~\~as soon as the inflows start coming in, they're crashing the whole game and making off with their prize winnings.  


So\~\~what happens when we launch a legal investigation into Citadel, and demand justice. Demand that they stop playing this game, and preying off of the people's money?  


They crash the stock market.",2021-01-30 00:25:26

Just be prepared for whats next!

By Al Root

The short squeeze that continues to send shares of GameStop higher has spread to other small capitalization stocks with high short interest. And while it would be more difficult for this kind of trading to spread to large capitalization stocks, there are some that share similar characteristics with those that popped.

High short interest is, essentially, a high percentage of total shares available for trading borrowed and sold by bearish investors betting on price declines. It can exacerbate a stock's price rise in a short squeeze because investors like hedge funds, who for the most part are active short sellers, have to buy more shares to cover bets as losses mount. That's what happened when traders targeted GameStop (ticker: GME) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), whose short interest is far above the average short interest for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500.

Goldman Sachs publishes a report that looks at the holdings of 814 hedge funds with $2.4 trillion of gross equity positions. As of the start of the fourth quarter 2020, the most recent report available, 10 of the stocks Goldman calls ""very important short positions"" for hedge funds with the highest short interest included: C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Aon (AON), Duke Energy (DUK), Analog Devices (ADI), Kroger (KR), Simon Property (SPG), Hormel Foods (HRL), Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) and Chipotle Mexican Grille (CMG).

Those are not small capitalization stocks like GameStop. GameStop is worth more than $24 billion as of Wednesday's closing price, but six months ago it was valued at less than $300 million. The average market cap of Goldman's group is about $44 billion. The least valuable company is Willis Towers Watson with a $26 billion market cap.

The short interest in these 10 doesn't compare with stocks such as GameStop or Bed Bath and Beyond, either. The average percentage of stock available to trade sold short in the 10 stocks is about 7%. Short interest in Bed Bath and Beyond is about 67%.

Lower short interest limits the potential for a big move. But there are rumblings of a squeeze. The average gain in the 10 VISP stocks over the past five trading days is about 1.2%. The S&P 500 is down about 2.6% over the same span.

If fallout from the GameStop squeeze continues, the impact could spread to those 10 stocks. Kroger and Hormel shares are already up more than others, by 17% and 13%, respectively, over the past five days. That's because losses piling up for hedge funds can cause them to sell long positions. It also means they may have to cover short positions, the trading action that is causing more intense short squeezes like GameStop's.

Gains like GameStop are unlikely for those stocks. Still, nothing seems to be off the table these days.

Storytime - How I underestimated the GME movement and lost a million dollars in the process,290,l7thzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7thzg/storytime_how_i_underestimated_the_gme_movement/,72,1611958431.0,"So little backstory. I've been around the markets for a while but I never did great or paid that much attention until I got into options in 2019. I'm pretty good with numbers and math was always my strong suit, so I felt this was a game I could actually be good at. I was. I turned 50k into close to 5 million this month (I have multiple accounts but IBKR was my main). Most of my big winners were TSLA options (bet big on Q1 2020 earnings using call spreads, and bought a bunch of leaps during COVID dip) and also put a lot of money into things that shall not be named except for in Elon's twitter profile.

Now to GME. I've been following WSB for over a year now I think, so I had seen DFV's posts. I followed a lot of the logic as I've seen short squeezes, gamma squeezes before, and I even followed the logic of the ITM options causing issues this Monday and Tuesday. So I had no position until Tuesday. On Tuesday, I saw not only did IBKR have over a million shares available to short but the fees were going down (I keep both the number of shares shortable and shorting fees visible as I believe this to be valuable information for investing in any stock). So on Tuesday with the stock trading in the 120s-130s, I thought this is going to be done soon.

Boy was I wrong. So I ended up selling 40 naked calls (1/29 $150) when I saw the prices of these spiking as well - average price of between $20-25. Big lesson - don't sell naked calls. I've done it before and it's worked, but it's not worth the risk. So arrogant me leaves these open cause AH trading for GME has been relatively stable. Then Elon tweets and it's all over. Even at the beginning of trading on Wednesday it looked like this bubble was about to pop, but then it shoots up to 365 and I'm liquidated for a total loss of around 1 million dollars.

Alright,  I'm fucking retarded and I suck at math, but I'll give you a long drawn  out post because I've got nothing better to do with my time.

First  let's take a look at the yahoo finance page for GME. According to the  statistics gamestop has 69.75M shares outstanding. That is how many  gamestop shares exist. Right below that you'll see that gamestop has  46.89M shares floating. That is how many shares are actually in  circulation and are ""tradeable"".

Now let's walk away from yahoo finance with those numbers in mind and go to  [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  According to this website 97.68% of shares outstanding for GME are  being shorted. Since we know that GME has 69.75M shares and 97.68% are  shorted you can do the math and find that the total shorted shares for  GME is around 68.13M.

Now that we  know that there are 68.13M shares being shorted we can compare that  number to the 46.89M shares floating. Do some more math and you see that  68.13 is 145.297504798465% of the total 46.89M shares floating.

So  we come to the conclusion that 97.68% of the shares outstanding are  shorted or 145.3% of the float, the shares that are actively being  traded, is shorted.",2021-01-30 00:12:11

Kevin O'Leary (Shark Tank's ""Mr. Wonderful""):  


""The definition of the market is speculation when you buy and stay long in a stock you are speculating about the profits you hope appear and you take that risk""  


""The best thing we could do for this market right now is leave it alone and just shine the light of transparency on it. if you are short, let it be transparent and you now run the new risk that these effective social media vigilantes are going to come after you and squeeze you in your short. And that's going to make a lot of hedge funds think a second time before they try and go short in a stock which I think it is great.""   


Paraphrase: We have 100s of millions of people who have nothing set aside for their retirement. And along comes a platform that has millions of investors....And yes, they will lose money as every investor does. Just shine transparency on it.  

And, finally, he made the argument that CNBC ignores, that GME now has a new lease on life:   


""How do you know that Gamestop executives are not going to take advantage of this situation and make a pivot just like Netflix did when they were shipping out CDS in the mail?"" 

Anchor breaks in to say they need to protect ""the little guy"" from the ""big guy"" (which is a joke since they only care about the ""big guy."") 

""The only person I care about are the people who lost their jobs. . . I really don't care if a few hedge funds go to zero. Who cares?""  


Anchor: what about the kids who take the stimulus checks and put it on margin and could go to bankruptcy:   


""They didn't learn investing in high school so let them learn in the real world."" 

I got so sick of CNBC yesterday that I ponied up for extra $14 a month for a cable package including Bloomberg and it is so much more balanced and nuanced plus you get a lot more news of world markets and commodities. CNBC really only covers U.S. stocks. Which is only a fraction of the financial/economic picture.",2021-01-30 00:04:10

Some of you may know of the Three peaks and a dome house pattern as it was brought up a few times  around march of last year. I believe SPX/SPY is forming the largest Three peaks and a dome house pattern ever seen, if correct this implies severe global economic downturn and the greatest depression in history. Here are some examples and a comparison to the current SPX 5 year chart so you can draw your own conclusions. 

look forward to arguing with you all.

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-29-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.

> The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.

*****

> # 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants

> J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses.

> U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket.

*****

> # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading

> Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively.

*****

> # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure

> Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.

Everything that has unfolded this past week from the media, the exchanges, the hedge funds and the big money at the top.

The 1% are under fire, from regulators and bankruptcy. This GME situation is unprecedented and will forever make history.

If they’re going down, they’re taking us with them, the volatility we’re all about to see will be known for generations to come.

A. They cant physically cover because there are not enough shares. It would not be logical to try. 

2. Then why havent they been force covering by their broker/bank/clearing firm?

A. This is the key, we have all seen the margin requirements for GME quadrupled for the rest of us this week. There is no way a normal hedge fund with 70m shorts can stay liquid at price 500. Hedge funds are all traders and the number one rule of trading is always to live and fight another day. They dont yolo like an autist. 

3. So who is behind the GME short?

A. Someone who is not affected by normal margin rules. Someone who is connected to all financial intermediaries. Someone who has near infinite capital or can create capital, someone who cannot be seen to be connected to this trade. 

My speculation is this is a major US bank, my money would be on Goldman. This is pure speculation. 

4. How can banks still prop trade after dodd frank?

A. This is easy and well known, they simply setup or fund a hedge fund that looks to be separate and secretly pull the levers behind the scene.


So there you have it. My guess is the people behind this short is the same ones behind the 2008 collapse, via roundabout ways behind the scene and once again if they fail US financial system go with them....

Here is the data: https://imgur.com/a/VRS7vLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, as of market close on Thursday, shorts on AMC have doubled down on their positions. Almost no shorts exited their positions during the criminal and illegal period where brokerages halted AMC/GME buying. This looks good for us, because a short squeeze has yet to happen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As seen on the short shares data, around 165 million of AMC shares are being sold short. To calculate short interest, we mainly want to look at 2 things: shares outstanding and market float. For all you autists out there, the difference between these 2 numbers is that market float is the total number of publicly available shares in the market. ON THE OTHER HAND, shares outstanding includes restricted shares (like executive stock options) that cannot be exercised without special permission from the SEC.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's important to look at here is the market float, because that is what we are competing against the hedge funds with. The current market float of AMC is around 100 million shares. With some quick monkey math, we see that the short interest with respect to the market float is 165%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does this mean for AMC? The squeeze has yet to happen. Buy shares and hold baby. Hedge Funds playing the short side will have nasty tactics up their sleeve, but they played their biggest trick on Thursday by restricting clearing firms and brokers. If we hold and buy shares, they are FUCKED.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW, ONTO GAMESTOP: Based on the data from my friend, the news is not as great for GME as it is for AMC, but it is still VERY good. Here is the short interest data for GME: https://imgur.com/a/N77KcfS. As we can see, those criminal hedge fund bastards closed a fuck ton of their short positions when the brokers restricted GME buying. As of now, the shorted GME shares is hovering around 60 million shares.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's do some more quick monkey math: Based on Yahoo finance, the market float of GME is around 47 million shares. This means the short interest with respect to market float is around 127% for GME. Although it is not as high as it used to be, the squeeze has yet to be squoze.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what do we do with GME? The same as AMC. We buy and hold and buy and hold until the criminal bastards at the hedge funds are forced to close their positions. I asked my friend for the short data on our other beloved stocks, and I will say that AMC has the highest short interest currently with respect to market float. However, if we buy and hold everything, the price will eventually squeeze. I know that RH is being retarded right now, but do everything you can to purchase these shares if we want to squeeze AMC/GME. Open Webull, Fidelity, etc. Personally, I hopped over to Cashapp to buy a fuck ton of AMC shares on the dip. Anything works. It's us against them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this get's enough attention/if all of you guys are interested, I will ask my friend to pull up the updated short data over the weekend to update you guys on Friday's (yesterday) price action.

Public Service Announcement for those coming off big wins - Take a pause to reset!,218,l80kji,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l80kji/public_service_announcement_for_those_coming_off/,113,1611974874.0,"Disclaimer - **I am not telling you to sell if you are confident in your DD and Positions**. This is general advice I don't see in WSB.

Fellow WSBers,

I felt the need to write this to the collective group. Many of you have added a zero or more to your overall NET WORTH in the last couple months, weeks or days. Congratulations, that is awesome. I am truly happy for you and wanted to offer some advice.

&#x200B;

* **Take a Break.** Revel in the win. You need some time to reset on your new situation.
* **Do something nice for your immediate circle** \- significant other, family, close friends, a stranger.
* **Don't tell everyone how well you did.** You can say in general but keep it vague. Your money is your money, no one needs to know. There are people in this world that will take advantage.
* **Leave 50% of the big win in cash** for at least a couple days, a weekend, a week to reformulate your move forward. Pushing it back into the game immediately is a great way to lose it all.
* **Don't forgot what got you here.** Some of it was luck, some skill, some determination. Accurately assess your ability. May be time to join Theta Gang with some of it and buy 100 block chunks of stock and sell some Covered Calls or sell Cash Secured Puts.
* **Start thinking about Retirement.** If you are young, start a ROTH IRA and fully fund it for 2020 and 2021. BIG BONUS - You can trade this money without worrying about taxes until you pull it out when you retire.
* **Pay off some debt** \-  Be smart actually transfer some to your bank account and pay off a credit card, student loan (leave $10k or less in cause Biden comes through), your car (maybe, most interest rates are 3.5% or so). I would probably not pay off a house cause you need dry powder for future plays but it does bring piece of mind.
* **Tax Man cometh and he will take away, prepare for it**. You will pay short term taxes (same as your income tax rate). Some of you will bump up a couple tax brackets this year and for the first time in your life have a significant tax bill. SET ASIDE 25% or more for taxes. If you held for over a year it is capital gains at 15%. If you traded in retirement accounts, congrats you trimmed years off your retirement age. It may be worth the money to actually talk to an accountant or tax professional. You may want to pay someone to do your taxes in 2020/2021.
* **DO NOT MAKE ANY BIG PURCHASES** for a time period. You will make poor decisions in the moment. Why do you think the casinos have expensive malls right next to them. Easiest way for them to get their money back is when you drop it on something that is over priced.
* **Review your budget**, or create one if you don't have one. Don't start spending above what your current salary/income stream is.
* **DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB.** Don't assume you can get similar results moving forward.  Don't become a day trader. The market has been crazy since last Feb/March and frankly for the last 10+ years. It can and may slow down.

These are the thoughts of a dad and exactly what I would tell my sons.

Why?!? Because now there are thousands of people who have a higher purchasing power. That means a lot more money will be spent in local businesses, shopping centers, car dealerships, etc. It will more evenly be distributed among the masses. It will also be taxed which means more money for government assistance programs and infrastructure, and all the other bullshit government spends on. It seems to me that this is more about ego and precedent than the actual dollar value for these market makers pushing against the squeeze. They stand to lose 11.2 billion, which to us seems like a lot but to them doesn’t even amount to a drop in the bucket. Long story short I think common sense says this will galvanize our economy.

"1-29 Market Dynamics, GME Should be $1000+, Systemic Risk Fears. Watch out today!",849,l806ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l806ec/129_market_dynamics_gme_should_be_1000_systemic/,259,1611974005.0,"**TLDR: Today's movements are a combination of panic around systemic failure Monday, with some selling of winners to buy GME and other meme stocks by the broad market.  It's also the VIX/Risk Parity unwind trade happening. My opinions: a) GME would be 4 digits if not for the factors today around calls and shares being hard to buy. So it could be 4 digits Monday, depending upon regulatory actions b) we are risking a real financial crisis here if GME does get to 4 digits, c) the fed & treasury dept are likely to intervene Monday and don't want this bubble, but dare only attack it indirectly, D) there's going to be over-regulation out of this. Positions: was short when I wrote, now long VIX to hedge catastrophe, but strongly long ES into weekend.**

We are seeing today is a bunch of things. It's a little similar to what we saw Tuesday and Wednesday - A lot of selling on fear of systemic failure. What is different though is that on Tues/Wed it was hedge funds covering shorts while dropping their winners. You can see this in the movement of GVIP which is an ETF that mechanically picks hedge fund long favorites. It underperformed market dramatically on those days, then overperformed yesterday. Today it is performing around market.

You also see winners being dumped by retail to now buy GME - I think that's clear in the chart.

Lastly, there's a risk parity trade and momo trade around VIX going on it's fear, risk parity trade, and retail dumping their favorites to buy GME. Explaining all in detail here:

**Why I think GME would be 1000+ Today Normally** 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

It's hard to buy call options. They are the leverage that makes this go up fast, multiplicatively with the narrow effective float now and the short interest. We aren't gamma squeezing as much, but it's still multiplicative in a way other parts of the trade aren't. Today, there's restricted buy (and IV is realy expensive...), and there are dealers selling 5m net shares as calls roll off (probably), and you can't get options most places... And the stock is still up a ton. That to me means without the unwind, and with options broadly available, and buys unrestricted, we'd be at $1000 today or more. Of course, we all know it's a bubble, and bubbles only sustain as long as net capital to the bubble increases. We surely are near the peak - after which it must unwind. But, regardless of the true outcome, we'd be at a much higher price today if not for all of these negative price dynamics piled on - limited new call options, trading restrictions, Friday option unwind. That leads me to my next point.

**Systemic Failure Fears:**

This GME thing is allowing a ton of leverage. Shorts leverage the stock with their 140% short. Longs are leveraged on calls. You put those together, and total GME leverage might be 40 or 50 or 60x at times when options were cheap (less now, but still significant), and it has further unpredictability around a failure-to-deliver option trade. Also, should illiquidity be created where there aren't really GME shares to sell, and dealers have to buy frantically or shorts are forced by dealers to cover, you'll see tons of forced selling elsewhere. Selling causes more selling, that selling causes vix spike, which causes selling... and that in turn means people who were OK on gme short now must cover because the rest of their portfolio is underwater. What might have been 15b to cover suddenly becomes 100b to cover, and other portfolios with no exposure to GME blow up too.

You put that all together, and there are real fears that this can cause a bankruptcy or at least lack of liquidity for any of Brokers (remember, Robinhood almost ran out of money yesterday), Market Makers, and also random carnage across institutions that are short (or long on margin).

It's impossible to forecast this, and models are breaking. In other words, people are scared, even though the total bubble here is only a about 10 billion dollars of capital really exchanged at the end of the day. But, this could cause contagion at this point - if a good amount of brokers, clearing houses, and/or market makers blew up, which I think is on the table if GME is in the thousands, the entire market gets de-stabilized for a while until it's fixed - trades won't clear, accounts locked, sudden drop in all liquidity, and a lot of loss of trust for a while. This is analogous to pinching an artery or something - the damage hits the basic infrastructure that allow the markets to function if it gets much worse, and there's a recovery period even if the damage isn't fatal. This is why I think the market is selling off so hard today primarily - no one wants to hold risk into a GME $1000+ monday, unless you are long GME. 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

Also note - as GME goes lower today, SPX is stabilizing. The less chance it goes to $1000+, the les chance of systemic risk. But, without the net option selling today, it likely would be up double. With new call options on, I think more. Which of course begs the question of if the regulators will allow for call options on Monday.  But, this clearly has upwards pressure that is strong.

**Hedge Funds:**

Hedge funds had to cover shorts and dump longs to stay properly levered. You saw that with the GVIP dump tues/wed. No longer the case - so hedge funds are either well hedged, or aren't really the ones being forced to cover shorts right now. But they definitely took big damage.

**Retail GME Trade:**

A lot of retail favorites are selling off more today, like Disney, various favored day trading stocks that aren't current memes, etc. That's adding some vol as people rotate to GME.

**VIX and Risk Parity, Momentum Funds**

Whenever vol of a stock in the S&P 500 goes up, the S&P 500 vix also has to go up too. There's a class of funds called 'risk parity funds' that basically try to adjust their allocation on risk/reward basis, so when vix goes up, they assume the risk of S&P 500 went up, so they allocate less to it.. this sends it down.. increasing vix. There are also momentum funds that see this happening and just chase the trend. That further adds momentum down. People aren't going to calm down significantly until systemic risk is off the table here.

**My Views on Fed Actions**

This is a financial crisis about to happen in plain view. The fed will take action to stop it, because it's obviously happening. They can do this very easily with lines of credit to brokers and clearing houses and market makers, and can also stop the cycle by keeping call options off on GME potentially, but that's more politically dangerous. In any case, I think the feds will find a solution that takes systemic risk off the table. They acted very fast during COVID. I think good chance they do it Sunday before market, then do it Monday. If they don't, Monday could become ugly.

I think the Fed will want the GME bubble to die, but they also don't want the political heat for blowing up a trade that's symbolic of political activism for a bunch of people. My sense is their only move is to just squeeze the option market to make it so few calls get created, while also restricting new shorts. If calls are fully restored, this goes very high very fast.  Restricting shorts does make it go higher too as it reliably ends the short interest. Realistically though, the fed and treasury want this to stop, and will be cunning.

**How I'm Trading This**

It's possible this gets resolved, or the fed does something now, or people BTFD with all the money, but I think this is a situation that could quickly make a -5% market move or a vix spike to the 40s again (we had 37 just 2 or 3 days ago at the close) into the close. So I don't really want to be long with anything 0dte and I'm currently effectively short + long vix. I  expect to switch long on my theory of fed support near or after the close, and a lot of people will be freaked out at the idea of carrying over-weekend risk into the potential of GME at $1000+ blowing things up. As I mentioned above, if SPX looked stable enough, I'd rotate long for next week - but would hold my VIX calls to near or at close no matter what.

**Overregulation**

The government will not let this crisis go to waste and will absolutely over-regulate. Expect sensible changes like - things that make shorting harder, and make it harder to have huge amounts of open interest of calls. But they may over-do it or do unrelated things. This will make our options trading hobby less fun unfortunately, because options will tend to be less accessible, more expensive and less potent.

*Yeah, I'm a bear sometimes. I'm actually up 50% YTD despite my horrid GME shorts. I like taking the plausible bets that win big when they work, and cost less when they don't. IT's the WSB mentality. I have a very small long-term put position on GME. I am long ES, long vol (hedge).*

You guys are confusing volume with real retail volume. Total Volume includes all the bullshit selling they are doing with each other. Retail volume is how much buying and selling is retail movement.

"" We are seeing short interest remain high though - my hypothesis is that the hedge funds covered their riskiest positions already and replaced those with new shorts (betting that the price would come down from its \~$300 level right now).

"Silver, an undervalued inflation hedge with short squeeze potential",818,l7zzg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver_an_undervalued_inflation_hedge_with_short/,253,1611973554.0,"# Silver as an inflation hedge

Historically, silver has acted as a stellar investment when the government is printing money or inflation is high. See the below graph to see how silver performed in the inflationary 70s and how it has performed over the last 20 years while the federal reserve has been expanding its balance sheet.

[Non-inflation Adjusted Silver Prices](https://preview.redd.it/ygjf3w5yhce61.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=14f2ed833b6ea911255af963f1dbc9ba892afa84)

I probably don't have to tell you, but I will for those who aren't up to date on the government finances. The government is printing a shit ton of money. Like, the amount of money printing is insane and unprecedented. The M1 money supply went from $4T to $6.7T in 2020 alone. That's a 40% increase in the amount of money! This has never happened in the history of the United States. See graph below.

[M1 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/t94jy8n0ice61.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb1acd38d62a4419c88144403409f9e8856c40c)

Once the vaccines are distributed, which is happening this year, and everyone can start to consume again, inflation will come roaring back. Commodities have already started blowing up which is a preliminary indicator of inflation. See the price of corn, soybeans, and steel below.

[Soybean Prices](https://preview.redd.it/7qistbc3ice61.png?width=2596&format=png&auto=webp&s=4082dd15f2ac0c0dc9d14e3844d79cf707b1f93c)

[Corn Prices](https://preview.redd.it/qe552ho5ice61.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1ee8e1f6f6a4a0ef02668e1cb61bfccca442de)

[Steel Prices](https://preview.redd.it/3gxihu07ice61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=54f4ca69f4e43c911db2bc3e26620cad2857dc4f)

Although the government has printed lots of money in 2020, it is guaranteed they will continue this trend into 2021. The fed is purchasing $120B every month of treasuries and mortgage backed securities, which is equivalent to printing another $1.4T this year. Also, the democrats control all three branches of government and have released a $1.9T covid bill. This is just the covid bill! Biden also has huge plans for infrastructure as well, meaning we will see another multi-trillion dollar bill this year! Because of the expected inflation from these actions, we've seen 10 year interest rates spike over the last month. An increase in interest rates means that big money is expecting increased inflation in the future and demand a higher interest rate to compensate for that. See 10 year interest rate spike below.

[10 Year Treasury Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/k4yflr8aice61.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6bca7107f2c10afe6ee33ea314c66ed06b8ae8b)

While 10Y interest rates are spiking, the real yield (interest rate - inflation) is falling! See graph below. This means that you are losing more and more money by holding a bond/treasury. There are [$20T of US treasuries](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-marketable-treasury-issuance-outstanding-and-interest-rates/) that are yielding negative interest and the people owning them want to get out! They are losing purchasing power by holding those treasuries!

[Real 10Y Treasury Interest Rates](https://preview.redd.it/c5b5bazcice61.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b014889e31790198d35bd309bb7d6a35235bc769)

So where will all the money go from the sold treasuries? Inflation hedges and stocks. What are some popular inflation hedges? Gold and silver. So which horse should we choose? Silver, because it has a much smaller market cap ($1T vs $10T) which means it is more volatile. Just look at what happened in 2020. From March to August, silver rallied 140% vs gold's 40%.

# Silver is historically undervalued

There are a few ways to look at the price of silver today vs the historic price. If we look at a current CPI inflation adjusted graph, we will see that the all time high of silver in 1980 was around $120/oz.

[Current CPI Inflation Adjusted Silver Prices](https://preview.redd.it/wd2m1q6gice61.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=76db652b758ae47ff599f7b1ea0653d1734c3497)

This shows that there is huge upside in the price of silver from where we are now, but that doesn't tell the whole story. After the inflationary 1970s, there were sweeping changes made to the CPI to mask the large amount of inflation that was occurring. You can read more about these [here](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/historical-changes.htm). Shadow Stats, a website devoted to measuring economic indicators with the original methods, has a graph of inflation measured with the old CPI shown below.

[1980 CPI Consumer Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/juq84d3kice61.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=059b11433926561c33a675bde2d3faa233eb6567)

If you've wondered why cost of living, houses, and other assets have gone up a ton over the last twenty years, while reported inflation is very low, this is why. If we use the 1980s CPI to calculate the inflation adjusted price of silver, we get a much different story.

[1980 CPI Inflation Adjusted Silver Prices](https://preview.redd.it/7n4crotlice61.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc6818aa9e4cc0d8ee02c0d2ef108c745ab7831)

This shows that the real all time high of silver is around $700! That's 26x the price of silver today. It's an understatement to say we are a long way from all time highs. What could bring us back to these highs?

# Silver supply and demand

Over the past 5 years, [silver supply has been drying up](https://www.cpmgroup.com/update-new-silver-supply-is-drying-up-faster-than-death-valley/). It is becoming harder and harder to get silver! This is due to declining grades at existing projects, a lack of new discoveries, and very few new mines coming online. Below you can see the change in the annual mine supply and the amount of money being invested in finding new mines.

[Changes in Annual Silver Mine Supply](https://preview.redd.it/qe2bfhknice61.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f23589c2a23a7716661ca20ae3604dd2bde69)

[Annual Additions to Silver Mine Capacity from Development Projects](https://preview.redd.it/uqkh7kvoice61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=50d30edaffa327c1ed52457feb5558c06836eb5f)

While silver supply is shrinking, [the demand is exploding](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190417102750.htm#:~:text=Silver%20is%20a%20core%20element,price%20of%20building%20each%20unit.com). Emerging technologies, like solar, exceedingly are in need of silver. We already touched previously on Biden's upcoming infrastructure/green bill, which was one of his largest campaign points. His agenda is to move away from oil and fossil fuels and towards green energies like solar. Many of these green energies use silver, which will [create sustained demand into the future](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/06/05/emerging-technologies-to-drive-silver-demand/?sh=1bc943337bd4)! Not only will there be sustained demand, but many banks are short silver leading to a possible short squeeze in the price.

# Silver has short squeeze potential

Silver has been heavily shorted and manipulated for years. There are multiple cases about JPMorgan and other banks resulting in [over $1B in fines](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html). Also, the paper silver market is over 200 times the physical silver market which means that there is not enough silver to go around if people take delivery! Investors pulled record amounts of silver off the COMEX earlier in 2020 and have started again. There are massive inflows into SLV, around $750M last week and $500M in one day. Look at the chart below to see the massive spike in inflow.

[SLV Inflows](https://preview.redd.it/fr73fecqice61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=946fd2dacacdf7ba21eaa06ed21ef65ce592494c)

SLV is an ETF that holds its silver in allocated accounts, which means it is taking the silver off the market and contributing to the paper silver squeeze.

# How to play this

I have 6/30/2021 $25C on SLV but I have heard PSLV is just as good. Both hold physical silver. Miners, like AG, are leveraged silver, but they will not contribute to a squeeze because they are producing silver, not pulling it off the market. My positions are shown below.

[My Positions](https://preview.redd.it/9d6iz6urice61.png?width=2210&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0eb9530b29335b519a89604117eea4eea7fbdac)

If this is well received, I will release future updates.

TLDR:

Silver is the perfect inflation hedge, supply is shrinking while demand is spiking, and a short squeeze could occur. Silver to the motherfucking moon. 🏄‍♂️🌕🚀

I manually added them up because I'm retarded. There's probably a way to do it automatically.

Right now at a stock price of $329, there are 63,025 calls expiring in the money today. At 100 shares per contract, that's 6,302,500 shares potentially trading hands after market close today. I say potentially because some people may choose to roll them out to a later date, reasons unbeknownst to me.

The current ITM strikes with the highest OI (Open Interest):

\-$115 - 10,371 contracts

\-$200 - 9,233 contracts

\-$320 - 7,835 contracts

The next highest strike up with high interest is $570 with 3,949 contracts.

I don't think it's any coincidence that the current price is hovering around $320. If I had to make a retarded guess, I'd say it's being ever so slightly manipulated to hover here. My uneducated guess is that just before market close, we'll see a short attack to drive it below $320, forcing the 7,835 call contracts at the $320 strike to expire out of the money.

I'm not a financial advisor, and I really don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I found a website and added up some numbers. Do what you want with this info. I'm truly an imbecile and you should in no way, shape or form use this information for your personal ""investing"" decisions.

**Not financial advice, stop messaging me asking what to do with your rent money, just go blow your landlord**

# Shorts couldn’t have covered because short interest is up!

This isn’t true. Suppose Melvin started covering their $20 shorts on Tuesday afternoon around $100 and continued to cover as the price was squeezed up to $200 after hours. That night margin calls go out and on Wednesday morning all the small shorts cover or get liquidated, squeezing the price up to $350. During that time institutions (possibly including Melvin) open up *new* shorts between $250 and $350. Short volume increases but those new short positions aren’t in any danger of getting squeezed unless retail drives the price to $400-$500. Short interest alone does not mean more squeezing is possible; you have to consider borrowing rates, entry points, and the number of involved institutions too.

# Shorts couldn’t have covered because volume was too low!

Also not true. The volume you see reported comes from the Consolidated Tape Plan (CTP). Exchanges and ECNs / dark pools are required to report trade information as it happens to the CTP for aggregation and redistribution out to all institutions and brokers, who then pass it down to their clients in the form of price and volume graphs. But not all trading happens on venues that are subject to CTP reporting. For example, Gabe Plotkin of Melvin could have simply called a few hedge fund buddies he knows to be *long* GME and cut a deal. He could also have gone to a Citadel and directly swapped out his shorts for higher priced shorts, paying the difference as a premium (sort of like rolling a short call out) and having Citadel’s market maker operations cover from their book (at the cost of liquidity for retail traders). Or he could have used Citadel’s loan to buy calls to collateralize his shorts. CTA reported volume does not tell the whole story.

# Keep buying and we’ll squeeze out the new shorts!

Retail buying power is probably going to get exhausted at some point. The initial argument for the GME squeeze was “Hey look, this company is undervalued, overshorted, and cheap”. Now the valuation is much higher and it’s no longer cheap enough for retail to move easily - and especially calls, calls are so expensive now that gamma squeezing to initiate a short squeeze is a lot harder.

Squeezing shorts that got in at $400 is going to be hard. And if you *did* squeeze them out, they will short again at $500 or $600. The higher the price and the less unreasonable the short entry points, the harder it will be to squeeze.

# Market makers will have to buy tons of shares today!

Probably not, to be honest. Market makers adjust their positions dynamically to remain delta neutral, they don’t just wait until the last minute to hedge. Sometimes (like during gamma squeezes) they fall behind and they get stuck with a directional position on the stock, and have to catch up later. But yesterday’s conveniently timed retail trader lockout kept gamma low and prices suppressed so there was plenty of time to catch up. You never know what could happen after hours, especially if a lot of options a right at the money, but don’t expect market maker hedging to kick off a subsequent short squeeze.


# So I should sell?

I’m not saying that, you just need to come up with a *new* reason for your decision, because I think the initial thesis has more or less been satisfied by this point.

Here are some reasons you might decide to hold or buy:

1. You think Gamestop the company is undervalued at $350.
2. You think squeezing shorts that got in between $250 and $350 is possible.
3. You think there is money to be made on volatility over the coming weeks, such as more gamma squeezing of market makers.
4. You think the media coverage will lead to more FOMO and you want to ride the momentum.
5. You think my reasoning is bullshit and the $20 shorts didn’t actually cover yet and are about to be liquidated.
6. You like the stock. You want to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder, own part of the company, take part in proxy votes, etc. and benefit from long-term growth of the business.
7. You want to make a moral statement about hedge funds, market makers, brokers, and the dirty pool they play.

If any of that rings true to you then take out a second mortgage on your house and buy that shit. (Don’t do that. >!Actually yes do that!<)",2021-01-30 04:10:23

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

Joe Kennedy famously decided to sell out of the stock market in 1929 before the crash after getting stock advice from his shoe shine boy, and taking this to mean that the market was saturated. When you hear your normie friends and family members talking about $GME and r/wsb, these are the modern day shoe shine boys.

At some point or another, $GME will have to return to a somewhat normal valuation. This doesn’t have to happen any time soon and could take quite a long time, but it will become a battle of who can remain solvent for longer. As much as I want WSB to win this battle, The cards are stacked against them. Hedge funds have more leverage, more resources, and lower interest rates. In the end, sadly, I think a lot of traders here coming late into the game will get fucked.

Let's debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin because this is getting ridiculous!,0,l7zfpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zfpe/lets_debunk_a_few_things_about_gamestop_and/,267,1611972331.0,"Hi,

I want to preface this by saying that this is not financial advice and this is purely for entertainment and informational purposes only. I have no position on Gamestop stock at the moment and no position on the other very volatile stocks either.

I realize that this is a long post that very few people will read so **if you don't want to read all this, at least read the next paragraph :**

TL;DR : *Gamestop is very risky and most probably much riskier than you can imagine as the stock price can go back to 10 or 20 in just a day or 2. The price does not reflect the fundamentals and if suddendly people realize that they can't sell the stock at a higher price as they hope they could, nothing will justify those high prices and the stock price will collapse very quickly. (See Wirecard chart to see what I'm talking about). A lot of you accept those risks the same way a lot of you accepted the risks of investing in bit###n or any scam related to it : you're ok with it only because it's going up and will cry about it as soon as it's going down. And for the novices here, I don't think you fully grasp how insane this is right now as you have no frame of references : you see stocks skyrocketting and think that this pretty rare and I'm here to tell you that it's never happened since the dot-com bubble and i don't know if you remember but this shit didn't end well (even for good tech companies).*

Another thing : English is not my native language so sometimes I'm going to express myself poorly and I apologize for it.

Now, I want to debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin Capital :


# 1. They will have to buy at $10 000 no matter what.

False. If they have the choice between waiting (and paying interest for borrowing the stock) even for years they'll do it as it's much MUCH cheaper than buying back the stock at $10 000 or any price above $400 (that I chose completely arbitrarely). As this is (in some way) unprecedented, they will have more help from banks and other hedge funds to help them keep their positions longer until this whole situation calms itself down to prevent them from selling at a completely absurd price.

# 2. They will go bankrupt as a result of this.

Nope. They got bailed out by some hedge funds and they will get bailed out by others in the future.

To prove my point, I'm going to take the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM for short) that was in a similar situation :

- At first, they had a good strategy : they had a bunch of arbitrage that nobody really thought of and they got really great returns (they averaged 40% annually).

- Then, other hedge funds copied their strategy and the opportunities got smaller and smaller, so LTCM decided to put riskier and riskier bets. Those bets were very big positions on very illiquid markets therefore if the trade were going badly, they were losing a lot of money and to add insult to injury, since it's in illiquid markets, they would have a very hard time to get out of their positions.

- One day, a bunch of those highly leveraged positions were going down big time and LTCM could not handle it. They sold a bunch of them at highly unfavorable prices but they couldn't liquidate their positions completely.

- Then, banks, hedge funds and the fucking federal reserve decided to bail them out to prevent a major financial crisis. They gave them billions of dollars, split their positions and therefore the losses as well.

- The hedge fund did not go bankrupt and it stayed alive for a while but then they stopped completely as their creditors got paid back.

If I'm telling you that long ass story, it's because it's really similar to what's happening with Melvin Capital : 

- They had a good strategy at first : shorting companies that are slowly going out of business.
- Then got into riskier and riskier plays : added more into their plays in hope to manipulate the price forcing the companies that they shorted to go bankrupt.
- One play went badly.
- Now they're being bailed out by a few banks and this is going to happen even more until this situation stops.

Now there are a 2 differences here :

- First, the positions that LTCM had had no chance of recovering and the price was going to be like that if not lower for a long time. In the case of Melvin, the price of GME will not stay at $10 000 and probably not even $500 for very long.
- And second, this is a much smaller position compared to what LTCM had back then. They had $4.6 billions of dollars in losses on highly leveraged plays, Melvin Capital doesn't have that much even with a $1000 stock price.

So what will happen in my opinion?

Melvin Capital will keep their positions as long as they have to. If the price doesn't go down, the government will probably force some stock holders or the company itself to sell the stock at a reasonable price to help them out.

# 3. This is like the 2008 crisis.

Like wtf??! 

This is nowhere near like the 08 crisis. Like what are you smoking??!

The CDS (the products that they bought back then) were literally worthless and could NEVER recover. A lot of people defaulted their loan and therefore those loans could NEVER recover. The banks were leveraged 30x meaning that for every million dollars worth of defaulted loans, their losses were at 30 million dollars.

Also, the sums for the 08 crisis was much MUCH bigger than the 10 billion dollars that the company is worth right now.

Also, in the case of the 08 crisis, a lot of those products got exchanged around the world and made it a worldwide crisis.

Finally, if you think this is like that, then remember that the government bailed them out with the taxpayer's money and a lot of banks and hedge funds actually MADE MONEY from this crisis. And some banks sold those worthless products to some of their clients that lost all of their 401K.

# 4. They will have to buy it back from us.

False, I've already debunked this : they will probably ask the company to sell it at a ""fair"" price whatever that means.

But to expand on that, I want to talk about the greater fool theory as this is probably the best example of this right now.

From Investopedia :

>The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

This is obviously happening right now as some of you bought the stock at $11 and sold at $20, some bought it at this price and sold it at $100 and so on.. and some of you bought it early and kept it this whole time hoping to sell it at a much higher price. 

This strategy only works if you're able to sell your security at the ""greater fool"" or in other terms, someone that is willing to pay it at a higher price.

Right now it works because everybody is hoping that the hedge funds (and mostly Melvin) will be the greater fools but they have much MUCH more ressources to go through before buying it at these ridiculous prices : manipulating the market to scare the retailers, halting the trading for the stock, preventing the retailers from buying the stock, getting bailed out by other banks, the government or the federal reserve. So i can GUARANTEE you that they will not be buying at those prices.

# 5. Shorting is criminal and should be illegal.

That's going to be short (no pun intended) : No. Shorting is a good strategy when you have a shitty company that will probably go out of business. Tell that to the ones that shorted Enron, Wirecard, or bought all those CDS (essentially shorting the housing market).

What should be prevented is abusing your shorting position to put pressure on a company and forcing them to bankruptcy as they were doing to Gamestop. 

If you shorted Blockbuster, Hertz, Kodak, and many others, it wasn't criminal, it was profiting off of a dying business. If you think this is horrible to do : this is debatable but also you're basically doing the same thing by trying to squeeze them out of their positions.

# 6. The class action lawsuit will result in Robinhood going out of business.
Robinhood will say that they halted buying the stock to protect their clients as this is a very volatile stock and they were not professionals. Also, they were issues with the clearing of the trades making it impossible for them to execute all those trades without impacting the trading of the rest of the securities.

Also, in the Customer Agreement, section 5-J :
> I understand that Robinhood may discontinue My Account and any services related to My Account
immediately by providing written notice to Me.

Also, they could just lie and make bullshit claims and will get away with this because their clearing house is fucking Citadel and Citadel is pretty fucking powerful in the financial system.

# 6-bis : People leaving Robinhood will result in Robinood going out of business.
Most people will not leave Robinhood. 

There were countless examples of pretty fucked up things that they've done and people still use it to this day. Quote from a comment that I've made a few days ago :

> After GUH moment, countless outages during very volatile moments, them using fucking Citadel (you know, the ones that gave money to Melvin to let them live a bit longer) to clear your trades, them not giving you the correct bid/ask data, the app being full of bugs, and them having a better mobile app than website, and [people] still use it??!

If after all this and way more, people still use it, people will still use it even after that because it's fun to play around in their app and now those retail traders are used to the app.

# 7. This is unprecedented, so nobody can really predict what will happen.
False, a lot of those things happened before, so this situation is not precedented but the MAGNITUDE of the situation is. You could definitely predict them preventing people from buying as they're scummy af, you could predict banks to bail them out (and even more in a few days) as this has happened before with LTCM. You can predict that they will not suffer the consequences because in all scandals they never fucking do as they're so important to our system and them going out of business will collapse the whole financial system. 

So here are the things that can happen :

- Gamestop is forced to sell their stock at a ""fair"" price. If they refuse, the government will threaten them with legal consequences like market manipulation or some bullshit like that (don't need to be right, just need to scare them with big consequences).
- Hedge funds will give their positions to banks and banks will sell them to customers (just like in the 08 crisis).
- They will be bailed out to prevent a big financial meltdown. Then, as people will realize that they will never close their position at the high price that they hoped they would, they suddendly sell their shares and the price of the stock will collapse. The hedge funds buy back the stock at a low price. They make money in the process and a lot of retails lose their life savings.

In fine, my point is that if you want to hurt them, you're hurting them a lot right now with your newfound power. But don't think for a second that this will result in them going bankrupt or any big consequences for them. This will result, as always, with them making a lot of money (or at the very least recouping their losses) and the retail investors losing all their money.

That means if an ETF investor wants to exit the fund, he receives the underlying stocks as payment instead of a cash payout. Redemption is dependant on weighted asset/stock value.

This week, a fund called SPDR S&P Retail ETF lost about 80% of its asset value because investors exited the fund.

Guess which stock amounted, due to its skyrocketing price, to almost 20% of the ETFs asset value at that time? **GME.**

It is likely that hedge funds or associated companies did this to obtain GME stock, which is hard and expensive to borrow right now, because you hold.

It is simple, if they cannot get stock, they lose. They are trying in every way to get stock to close their positions. They try to borrow it expensively, they get it out of funds via the big banks that demand high premiums I bet. They need stock so badly, I think it is not far fetched to assume they called the board of GME and asked them to issue more stock.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

But really, hold GME.
I'm hugely skeptical of all the information being put out. Shitron ""will no longer publish “short reports”"". Doesn't mean they won't stop shorting, just like every other Wall Street guy. Cramer saying sell. **IT'S ALL BULLSHIT**

Now onto Short Interests.
Hold your GME shares, it'll hurt all the way up for these fucks. Why you say? 

Based on supposed data from S3 (I will continue to refer to everything as supposed, because it's getting insane to discern credible news anymore).


Link: [(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

short interest is $11.20B; 57.83M shares shorted; 113.31% of Float; 53.12% S3 SI% Flt; 29% fee & easing. Shares shorted down -5.08M shares, worth $983 million, -8.07%, last week. Shorts down -$19.75B in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$7.83B on today's +70% move.


**That's almost $8 Billion dollars boys and girls. If that continues, and shorts stay in (this is also approximate math), that means at $1k per GME it'll be at least $32B more compounded onto their loss porn.** (BETTER FUCKING SHOW THAT SHIT, I GET OFF TO IT)



Now onto AMC (same data sources)

[(Cool pictures on twitter)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194013461204994?s=20)

short interest is $384M; 44.47M shares shorted; 15.75% of Float; 13.61% S3 SI% Flt; 11.32% fee. Shares shorted down -906K shares, worth $8 million, -2.00%, last week. Shorts down -$523M in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$211M on today's +55% move.


Only $211M on a 55% move... That means to reach gamestop levels of loss porn, the stock would have to practically need to hit 2000% gains at the moment (math here: $8b losses on gme divided by $211M losses on amc, multiply all this by 55% and you get 2000%, math is probably wrong but I'm autistic.)


That's why I see 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 for GME. Continue holding AMC, but I'm on the DFV train. I SELL WHEN HE SELLS.

**EXTREME TL:DR:** You don't have to do anything but hold.


**TL:DR:** I see GME as a bigger adventure (and war). Hold till hedge funds have to declare bankruptcy. All this current news is fluff to convince you to sell your tendies and make them money. They're still shorting because they think we're 🧻🧻🧻🙌🙌🙌 bitches. BUT we're 💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌.

Ripped directly from tweet:
Question: Why is S3's 53.12% SI % Flt different than 113.31%? is this taking into account the actual amount that is float that is owned by WSB that will continue to hold?

To start, I am a paper handed bitch for selling. I won't apologize because I have my own priorities and needs, and this money is life changing as I have a cost basis in the $20s.

On Wednesday, I sold 204 of my GME shares on RH and received a confirmation that the order was filled. Because RH is a completely unreliable platform that has unclear policies and fucked over many retail investors, I decided Thursday morning to transfer all assets to my Fidelity account.

This morning, Friday, I woke up to find 204 shares of GME in my Fidelity account, and that the cash from the Wednesday sale was not included in the transfer. My RH account is also now deactivated.

I've contacted Fidelity and successfully confirmed the legitimacy of all of this and sent a note to RH to determine what happened. I am taking screenshots of everything to protect myself.

The bad: I would have had no clue that my sale had not been completed had I not initiated an account transfer, and could have lost tens of thousands if GME fell after it pierced Pluto's rectum.

To my fellow WSB'ers, be fucking careful with RH. Screenshot your orders and positions. Apes strong together, but court cases are stronger with clear evidence.

Why the Short Squeeze cannot go on forever,708,l7yogv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7yogv/why_the_short_squeeze_cannot_go_on_forever/,137,1611970662.0,"I have seen posts about short-sellers; why do they need to close their position?  Can't they hold out until the price goes down?  They can indeed do that, but they have to pay to borrow those shares, and I got curious, what ARE they paying to not close?

So I looked it up and thought I would share. I found this short FAQ on selling short shares providing rough calculations based on the current price of GME,

[https://ibkr.info/article/1146](https://ibkr.info/article/1146)

I found a rate of 32\~% on GME short Borrow Fee Rate, and I am lazy and assuming 60 million shares of being shorted every day.

60,000,000 shares X $300/share = $18 billion dollars are being borrowed for shorting.

$18 Billion \* 32% / 360 days in year = $16 million dollars a day (trading day or not)

Roughly, they are losing $300 million a month! Also, the money that they have tied to margin on the short cannot be used elsewhere.  If they could have been making 5% somewhere else, they are effectively paying 37% to short GME stock.

So you say, ""when will the squeeze happen?""  The better question is WHY the squeeze will happen.  At some point, these hedge funds are going to need that money for something else.  They are losing 300 million a month.  That is assuming the price does not go up.  If it goes up any more, they are losing more on interest (the amount they pay in interest is calculated daily).

The other problem for them is what happens when they cannot borrow shares anymore.  If I decide, I want to sell, and the brokerage has to get the stock back from the short-seller.  The short-seller has to go to the market and buy for whatever price is available. 

In a way, as a stock owner, YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN PRICE.  If the liquidity in the market disappears, you can set your price to be $1000, AND THEY HAVE TO PAY IT TO GIVE YOUR STOCK BACK.

GME - Shkreli Thoughts 1/29,885,l80sl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l80sl1/gme_shkreli_thoughts_129/,265,1611975390.0,"I was away the last few days giving depositions to a different three-letter government agency--sorry about that. GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.

  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.
  
So, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.

  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.
 
 That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's ""bubble"" is another man's ""deep value."" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?
  
No. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, ""what happens if your client can't clear this trade?"". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.
  
Many of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.
  
For those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:

1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.
    
2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.
    
3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.
  
When you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The ""next"" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.
  
I still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of ""destiny"" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. 
  
I hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. 
  Good luck WSB, I love you!

My drug induced best guess is Gamestop will become Redbox. In dummy words: Gamestop will shut down physical large stores and sell games from vending machines due to increased digital sales. Gamestop used to be the place dad would go to have some smart nerd tell him which game to buy the kid so dad can see his mistress Yulia more often. Now it's literally just a smelly box with games.

So why don't they buy Redbox or another company that has logistics and tech to distribute games everywhere. There's only a handful of MUST HAVE games in any given quarter. This is a no brainer. Where is my mistake? Not enough coke?  


Other opportunities:

* something related with real money & gambling
* become a nerd-community center (esports, more merch)
* not sure how they can ever compete in Mobile Games ?

Let me know your thoughts idiots

If you follow this advice, you’ll probably lose your money. [I’m not smart](http://wiki.chssigma.com/images/a/a0/Little_tikes_car_why.jpg). I’m straight up lying and misinformed. This is satire. Don’t do this. Pay your obligations. Don’t bet what you can’t afford to lose, etc. etc. 

Thesis: 🌈🐻 r not fuk and then 🌈🐻 are ultra fuk. 🦘🦘🦘🦘🦘🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Hold on to your buttsacks. I think you noobs entered the market at the wrong fucking time.  

I have a secret weapon. It’s called GEX. I’m not going to explain how it works. You don’t have the attention span anyway. Except it’s not a secret. Everyone with half a fucking clue knows about GEX. Go ahead and backtest it. Combine it with a few other signals. It’s my doomsday machine. 

Brakes are cut, bitches. Rouge soldiers are in the air right now on their way to drop that liquidity bomb that we all thought was actually going to come from the Fed saying “interest rates too low imo” somewhere near 2025. 

Well, that liquidity bomb damn near happened a couple times this week. There’s some pretty good DD floating around about that but I’ll let you go hunt for it.

If there are any bears even left, they’re spending their weekend rage splooging all over the Lambo catalogue because they know how close they came to being able to afford food again. 

They’re not done, imo. The market is saying we’re pricing options in a way that expects a tremendous, earth-shattering move. But like I said, everyone with half a clue already knows about GEX and sees this too *and is getting ready for it*. 

Boom. Major bear market. 

End of days all r fuk?

Yes. And then no.

Imo, this bomb is occurring in a market environment that has never been more ready to take it to the face and punch back. Money is cheap af right now. There’s liquidity upstream. Three Gorges Dam liquidity that’s ready to buy.the.fucking.dip. But I don’t think they’re going to be able to smash the damn down quite fast enough. It’s entirely possible that they do; in that case, my thesis r fuk.

But if I am right, I think I might actually get a chance to do a March2020 do-over. 

And this time, I’m not even going to worry about winning on the way down. I’m buying the fucking dip.

Be On Guard for Them To Flash Crash GME At 3:59 to Lower The Price.,1714,l80zi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l80zi6/be_on_guard_for_them_to_flash_crash_gme_at_359_to/,233,1611975804.0,"We've observed how much they've manipulated markets.  Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys.  This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm.  If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:59pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want.  This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit:  From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

They cheated yesterday and could only get down to 113% of float. The 53% refers to short interest including synthetic long shares which are created during shorting.

[EDIT: YOU TARDS ARE STUPIDER THAN I THOUGHT. SHARES SHORTED HAS DROPPED FROM *62M TO 58M.* THE SI % / FT INCLUDING SYNTHETIC FLOAT IS A CALCULATION TOO ADVANCED FOR YOUR SMOOTH BRAINS]

Also, buy shares with cash (not on margin) based on what we saw yesterday. And a stop loss means you’ll be hunted. I personally have a number in my head that can’t be front run. Smooooooth brain moves. (:

No one likes them as much as you. There are 2 other douches, Melvie and his friend Hedgy. 

Melvie promised the baddest motherfucker on the island he’d give him 14 coconuts (139% short interest).

I’m the meantime, you gathered up 10 coconuts into a bag. MELVIN wants your coconuts bad, or else that mean motherfucker he promised them to will bash his brains in, then throw half his body into a volcano and feed the other half to a shark.

So Melvin and Hedgy want to buy your coconuts from you. It cost you $1 a coconut to get them. 

HERE’S THE BEAR RAID:
So Melvin and Hedgy pass the one 🥥 they have back and forth and say “here, have this for 90 cents”, then “no you take it for 80 cents” all the way down to a penny. Then they turn to look at you, fear in their eyes and piss in their pants and say “see, these are only worth a penny”, praying desperately to whatever god they believe in that you’ll buy it.

ARE YOU BUYING THAT SHIT? 

**NO BECAUSE YOU AREN’T A SUCKER AND YOU HAVE DIAMOND HANDS. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT FOR THOSE THINGS OR ELSE MELVIE IS DONE FOR.**

That’s the bear raid. That’s it. It’s the last price it traded for on low volume. Don’t believe it. It’s the only trick they have and it used to work, but not anymore now that millions of us can communicate and know what’s going on. They think we are so fucking stupid short interest is still over 100% today.

But You know for a fucking fact they have to deliver. 

Shorting costs money. Margin interest isn’t free, and margin gets called and puts expire worthless. Holding your hairy coconuts is free. All you have to do is nothing and they will bleed money until they are forced to pay whatever you want, or they go bust.

While being in the zeitgeist is fun, I honestly don't see any good coming from the increased attention.

Wall St and the financial media are trying hard, and succeeding to a large extent, at making this about retail investors gambling to take down the GME shorts. Lost in the noise is the fact that hedge funds acted irresponsibly, with seemingly no risk management, to create the conditions necessary for this. Chamath mentioned it briefly on CNBC and they promptly tried their best to take down the video.

There's very likely a lot of big money long GME trying to squeeze out the shorts as well, with retail investors playing a very small role.  Citadel and Point72 used this to get a revenue sharing deal with Melvin Capital. Michael Burry, who went long on GME last year - arguably in part due to the short % - has been trying hard to distance himself from the situation and there's barely any mention of him in the media.

I think some hedge funds are going for the kill and retail investors - specifically this sub - are being setup to take the fall, in case this blows up the wider market.

Brokerage firms put stop to your ability to buy new positions on GME AMC NOK BB but allowed people to keep selling. They seem to be deflecting when asking why the option to sell was still available by making it seem as if it was the perk they allowed us to keep. In doing so many people sold and were unable to buy back causing the stocks to plummet. This was a fabricated demand shortage 📈 with which brokerages were allowed enough time to call on other multi-billion dollar institutions to help cover their positions. 

Now things are at the point where it seems that on most if not all platforms you can only make limited purchases but still unlimited sales. This seems to be the same tactic from yesterday but on a smaller scale. It’s a fabricated demand shortage effectively slowing momentum. These brokerage firms have also begun limiting people’s instant deposit availability.

I heard some reports that the restrictions today are being tightend even more. We know they're colluding with Citadel.

**Consider following tips when contemplating to switch:**

• If you plan to switch but have $GME shares on Robinhood, DON'T TRANSFER (because it may freeze your stocks for an uncertain amount of time).

In this case HOLD on with RH and SIGN UP to other brokers when buying more shares (recommendations below). 

• In all other cases, CASH OUT (of your insignificant positions) and TAKE the money with you 

*BTW CONSIDER REMOVING ALL 420.69$ LIMITS...WE MIGHT GO HIGHER*

**RECOMMENDED BROKERS:**

• **FIDELITY!!!!!!!!** (super quick and awesome + didn't sell us out yesterday)

You can literally set it up in 5 minutes and make an instant deposit 

•SoFi (cool and simple interface)

•Vanguard 

•TD Ameritrade (had issues yesterday but instant buying power)

• FEEL FREE TO ADD MORE IN THE COMMENTS

URGENT - Be On Guard for Them To Flash Crash GME At 3:59 to Lower The Price,3987,l82mvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82mvg/urgent_be_on_guard_for_them_to_flash_crash_gme_at/,253,1611979544.0,"We've observed how much they've manipulated markets. Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys. This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm. If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:45pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want. This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit: From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [AMD](https://ibb.co/d0cPRrj), they are one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, and they operate in multiple segments like Computing, Gaming, Enterprise, Semi-Custom and many more with some of the most important products for the company being microprocessors and GPUs both for personal use like (gaming consoles & PCs) while also offering products for professional use like data centers.

The company was founded more than 50 years ago and have more than 11K employees, with the company overperforming recently as they have seen a more than 80% rise in the last year.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly [results](https://ibb.co/f0CLSF7) for AMD. The company reported a revenue of $3.24B in the 4th quarter, with a 53% growth since last year, while for the full year they earned almost $10B as they more than doubled they quarterly and full year net income, which resulted in a $1.29 earnings/share for the year.

The [company](https://ibb.co/TY6trfs) has 2 major income segments in Computing & Graphics which brought in sales of over $6.4B for the year and an operating income of $1.26B and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment which brought in $3.3B in revenues and almost $400M in operating income. They also provide an additional segment that doesn’t bring in any revenues but which represents costs that can’t be associated with any of the other 2 segments, but also includes stock-based compensations and acquisitions related costs.

Both of these 2 [segments](https://ibb.co/qdfVyrK) have seen huge increases in the past year with operating income doubling for the computing & graphics segment and increasing by almost 50% for the EEC segment.🚀🚀

[AMD](https://ibb.co/tYmkPwg) didn’t have such a big capital expenditure in 2020, with only $294M but this can increase depending on the demand of their products while they also [adjusted](https://ibb.co/hCtfk2k) their income with $312M in depreciation & amortizations. Both of these numbers have increased by 40 to 50% in the past years and will be important in the DCF valuation. 

They have also managed to increase the gross profit margin to 45%, up 2% from 2019 as their earnings before interest & tax or [EBIT](https://ibb.co/xDptyzW) stood at $1.37B.

The company has seen a continued earnings per share [growth](https://ibb.co/FhLj0Y7) overall, despite the first 2 quarters of 2020 coming in lower than previous, but that was to be expected as this was impacted by the reduced [revenues](https://ibb.co/QdjCvnx) in Q1 & Q2 before things started to pick up back again, as they finished with a huge increase overall in the 4th quarter.🚀🚀

Their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/YkjNDbY) has become a great challenge to Intel’s market share and is continuing to evolve, as Intel is still struggling to regain momentum with their products.🚀

[AMD](https://ibb.co/XX3h4CD) announced the world’s best processors for laptop and an enterprise variant that is expected to be available in the first half of 2021.

They have also launched the fastest [AMD](https://ibb.co/fQQnFj4) gaming graphics card ever while also [working](https://ibb.co/D9dDDYs) with big companies like Amazon on their AWS cloud offerings & Microsoft Azure which are planning to use their upcoming 3rd generation EPYC processors.

AMD is also involved in supercomputers which indicates that they are continuing to innovate and develop products that will be in high demand for the foreseeable future🚀

The one big thing that can propel AMD even more in the future is the proposed acquisition or more rather merger with [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/N2YQFS9) 🚀, which also beat earnings expectations the other day, with revenues of over $800M for the quarter and a Free Cash Flow of 44% of their revenues. [Xilinx](https://ibb.co/QH8RTCN) has a market cap of over $32B, and the combination of the 2 companies would [create](https://ibb.co/qJM6Gn4) synergies. [They](https://ibb.co/PcNhH58) are targeting an all-stock transaction which will have implications on my projections, but as time has gone, the $35B price tag is only a 10% premium for Xilinx. The one hurdle the companies have to pass is the regulatory procedures. We will have to wait and see if the deal goes through or not, as it’s expected the deal should be finished by the end of the year, with AMD shareholders retaining 74% of the new group shares and Xilinx holding the remaining 26%.

AMD also offered great [guidance](https://ibb.co/n649gFm) for 2021 as they expect the strength of their product [portfolio](https://ibb.co/Xbx5TV4) to push AMD revenues up 37% over 2020 and also expect their gross margin to increase to 47%, while they [expect](https://ibb.co/RpcwXYr) an effective tax rate for next year of 15%, well belove the 21% US corporate tax rate.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/hKFMswn) to see what the current valuation of the company is.🚀🚀🚀

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later on in the long-term projection and the net income for 2020 to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to a $1.68B EBITDA. 

For the next years I used 1% increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and an increase in capex of 10%/year in order to maintain an increased production capacity while also applying a 15% decrease in their net working capital.

So, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the Average SP500 return, we get a $9.7B Discounted Free Cash Flow by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt, which in this case stands $5.75B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though some of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach and other on the growth approach. 

If we use the growth approach, we can see that AMD is pretty fairly valued right now, as this implies a loss of 2%, while on the other hand the EBITDA multiple approach gives us a valuation of over $112, meaning an almost 30% undervaluation of the company. But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for AMD in 2021 is $98.82, implying a 13.5% return from the last price.

And now let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for AMD.🚀🚀🚀

For my [projections](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the EEC segment for 2021 and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth, while for the Computing & Graphics segment I implied a 35% growth, way lower than the over 100% they saw in 2020, also implying a gradual slowdown of the trend by 2025.

I think these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high [demand](https://ibb.co/vQFwyRd) the company has seen for their entire product line, especially as gaming revenues have continued to increase, and also taking into account the need for their products in data centers, cloud usage & digital currency mining.

For their cost of [sales](https://ibb.co/cx8pfhr), I started from the current ones which stand at 80% for the Computing & Graphics segment and implied a 1% improvement each year, while for the EEC segment I started from the 88% expense margin right now and implied a gradual 2% improvement. I also maintained their other expense regarding to the cost of sales to 3% of their total revenues, in-line with the previous years.

This means for [2025](https://ibb.co/swQfJgf) we would get just over $33B in revenues and $26B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $7B. I also maintained the same capex as in the DCF and also [substracted](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) the interest & other expenses for which I implied a 5% annual growth, thus leading us to a $6.28B in earnings before tax. 

I [maintained](https://ibb.co/SshLk4K) their 15% effective tax rate projections and also diluted their shares by 1% each year accounting for some dilution in the stock.

So, for the $5.3B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 1.27B shares, that would mean a $4.21 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://ibb.co/HYzfCkz) is trading at 20 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

I like to base my future projections on Forward/PE valuations so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $105 and almost $168.   🚀🚀🚀

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/SyN8bn9) are my actual price targets🚀🚀🚀 

I think the 2025 bear case price we can see AMD trade at is $115 which would imply a return of almost 33% , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that AMD will trade at 137$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 57% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $158, which would imply a return of over 81%. So yeah guys, [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40. 

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkJLAXxwqbo6WEfR9NfPEKZagiW4EVbRsz58ejqTVEI) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for AMD by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

I think these are pretty reasonable [targets](https://ibb.co/9NTJYmP), as the semiconductors industry will keep on booming in the next decade, as the world will need more & more chips that also keep advancing in technology. 

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/NCtxnFq), with almost $9B in assets vs just $3.1B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by just the current assets.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the [analysts](https://ibb.co/G0QpnrW). We can only see EPS estimates until 2023 of $3.22, which I think is safe to say can grow an additional dollar by 2025, so my projections are pretty in-line with what other experts anticipate.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for AMD?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/wQw6CQP), the stock just broke below the long-term uptrend but has seen good support at the $86-87 levels, which is where the next support should stand. We saw AMD pushing towards $100 in the beginning of the year, but it hit major resistance once [Intel](https://ibb.co/pjHdVFQ) also announced a change in their leadership, as they brought in the WMWare CEO Gelsinger, but it’s very hard to see him turn around Intel in a very short time. Intel will need some years & a lot of capital expenditure to turn things around, if they do manage to do it at all. 

AMD hasn’t been overbought since August, and currently has an RSI near 41, which is pretty oversold for a good company, so I expect to see them regaining some momentum in the near-term, but I guess the market is very busy with the current short-squeezes. AMD will se a lot of resistance breaking through the $100 level, not because of something fundamental with the company, but I guess it’s a psychological resistance rather.

And let’s take a quick look at what 24 [analysts](https://ibb.co/bKRQwXP) on Wall Street are saying. They mostly have a buy call on the company with an average price target of $100 and a high price target of $135. So, I think the analyst are pretty spot on with AMD, but my PT are slightly lower as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own AMD stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position right now and add on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops even lower than 80$.🚀🚀🚀

One last thing to mention about AMD is that they also have a very big % of their [shares](https://ibb.co/zZcxm95) held by institutions, with over 74% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock which does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think [Lisa SU](https://ibb.co/X2nVGTF) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO, and has driven AMD to a renewed approach to their business, as the [company](https://ibb.co/WtBf4yF) has been booming in the past 5 years, growing more than twice as much as Nvidia and crushing the SP500 and Intel’s performance.

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option.
2) Scroll all the way down the call list
3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

You could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",2021-01-30 06:17:25
Robinhood is A Crucial Element In This Battle. Don’t Let Them Off The Hook.,727,l82xwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82xwk/robinhood_is_a_crucial_element_in_this_battle/,78,1611980225.0,"Why? Because it’s the platform that the majority of people use to trade GME. In my earlier post I explained the psychology of why the additional steps needed to find a new broker is unattractive to most new investors. By making it harder to buy shares, less people will go out of their way to buy them. 

Retail investing is strong because of Robinhood, it’s the ease and simplicity that attracts people. The familiarity and social proof from seeing screenshot after screen shot helps too. Names like Fidelity and Vanguard are slightly more intimidating and perceivably more “complex” when in actuality, they are not (although the UI less beginner friendly imo).

Just moments ago I noticed Robinhood switched the 5 shares limit down to 1. Meaning if you own more than 1 share of GME you cannot buy anymore thus continuing to remove buying pressure. 

If Robinhood were to remove all buying restrictions it would enable millions of potential pent up buyers who are simply too, for lack of a better word, lazy to switch brokers. The volume has been much lower since RH’s buying restrictions, 170m+ every day from 1/22-1/26, while today less than 40m so far.

We seemed to have let RH off the hook after their announcement stating that buying is turned back on when in fact, it is not, well, unless you have 0 shares, you can buy 1… for now. 

**We need to continue to fight to get the buying restrictions on Robinhood lifted.** Sure you can yell at people to switch brokers but I don’t think it will have nearly as big an impact as getting the restriction lifted on RH.

Even with the heavy selling pressures, the hold is strong which is incredible, I am still holding too. Until the restriction is lifted, if you have a great broker that is reliable and easy to use, please drop it in the comments below for people to see! I use TD Ameritrade.",2021-01-30 06:17:05

Think the wolf of wall street, those are our aspirations.

**If retail had shorted 220% of GME's float we would be squeezing them just as hard**

Sure, its funny to take down some stuck up fund managers, but thats a side bonus. We make fun of Citron because Andrew Left got his wife stolen by a green energy billionaire, we make fun of Melvin cuz they tried to short a meme stock.

We have shorted plenty of stocks. Nobody cares. Last year we all made a killing riding the markets down while the normies lost their jobs and lived off stimmy checks. We ride the trends in whichever direction they point. The markets are a zero sum game. Welcome to the club.

But anyways, we owe you a thank you I suppose. Without you getting super jazzed for the 'revolution' we would have never had the capital to squeeze like we did. You may hate millionaires but you certainly made a ton of new ones this week.

Let's debunk a few things about this situation with Gamestop and Melvin Capital because this is getting ridiculous!,0,l83j8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83j8d/lets_debunk_a_few_things_about_this_situation/,213,1611981584.0,"Hi,

I want to preface this by saying that this is not financial advice and this is purely for entertainment and informational purposes only. I have no position on Gamestop stock at the moment and no position on the other very volatile stocks either.

I realize that this is a long post that very few people will read so **if you don't want to read all this, at least read the next paragraph :**

**TL;DR** : *Gamestop is very risky and most probably much riskier than you can imagine as the stock price can go back to 10 or 20 in just a day or 2. The price does not reflect the fundamentals and if suddendly people realize that they can't sell the stock at a higher price as they hope they could, nothing will justify those high prices and the stock price will collapse very quickly. (See Wirecard chart to see what I'm talking about). A lot of you accept those risks the same way a lot of you accepted the risks of investing in bit###n or any scam related to it : you're ok with it only because it's going up and will cry about it as soon as it's going down. And for the novices here, I don't think you fully grasp how insane this is right now as you have no frame of references : you see stocks skyrocketting and think that this pretty rare and I'm here to tell you that it's never happened since the dot-com bubble and i don't know if you remember but this shit didn't end well (even for good tech companies).*

Another thing : English is not my native language so sometimes I'm going to express myself poorly and I apologize for it.

Now, I want to debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin Capital :


# 1. They will have to buy at $10 000 no matter what.

False. If they have the choice between waiting (and paying interest for borrowing the stock) even for years they'll do it as it's much MUCH cheaper than buying back the stock at $10 000 or any price above $400 (that I chose completely arbitrarely). As this is (in some way) unprecedented, they will have more help from banks and other hedge funds to help them keep their positions longer until this whole situation calms itself down to prevent them from selling at a completely absurd price.

# 2. They will go bankrupt as a result of this.

Nope. They got bailed out by some hedge funds and they will get bailed out by others in the future.

To prove my point, I'm going to take the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM for short) that was in a similar situation :

- At first, they had a good strategy : they had a bunch of arbitrage that nobody really thought of and they got really great returns (they averaged 40% annually).

- Then, other hedge funds copied their strategy and the opportunities got smaller and smaller, so LTCM decided to put riskier and riskier bets. Those bets were very big positions on very illiquid markets therefore if the trade were going badly, they were losing a lot of money and to add insult to injury, since it's in illiquid markets, they would have a very hard time to get out of their positions.

- One day, a bunch of those highly leveraged positions were going down big time and LTCM could not handle it. They sold a bunch of them at highly unfavorable prices but they couldn't liquidate their positions completely.

- Then, banks, hedge funds and the fucking federal reserve decided to bail them out to prevent a major financial crisis. They gave them billions of dollars, split their positions and therefore the losses as well.

- The hedge fund did not go bankrupt and it stayed alive for a while but then they stopped completely as their creditors got paid back.

If I'm telling you that long ass story, it's because it's really similar to what's happening with Melvin Capital : 

- They had a good strategy at first : shorting companies that are slowly going out of business.
- Then got into riskier and riskier plays : added more into their plays in hope to manipulate the price forcing the companies that they shorted to go bankrupt.
- One play went badly.
- Now they're being bailed out by a few banks and this is going to happen even more until this situation stops.

Now there are a 2 differences here :

- First, the positions that LTCM had had no chance of recovering and the price was going to be like that if not lower for a long time. In the case of Melvin, the price of GME will not stay at $10 000 and probably not even $500 for very long.
- And second, this is a much smaller position compared to what LTCM had back then. They had $4.6 billions of dollars in losses on highly leveraged plays, Melvin Capital doesn't have that much even with a $1000 stock price.

So what will happen in my opinion?

Melvin Capital will keep their positions as long as they have to. If the price doesn't go down, the government will probably force some stock holders or the company itself to sell the stock at a reasonable price to help them out.

# 3. This is like the 2008 crisis.

Like wtf??! 

This is nowhere near like the 08 crisis. Like what are you smoking??!

The CDS (the products that they bought back then) were literally worthless and could NEVER recover. A lot of people defaulted their loan and therefore those loans could NEVER recover. The banks were leveraged 30x meaning that for every million dollars worth of defaulted loans, their losses were at 30 million dollars.

Also, the sums for the 08 crisis was much MUCH bigger than the 10 billion dollars that the company is worth right now.

Also, in the case of the 08 crisis, a lot of those products got exchanged around the world and made it a worldwide crisis.

Finally, if you think this is like that, then remember that the government bailed them out with the taxpayer's money and a lot of banks and hedge funds actually MADE MONEY from this crisis. And some banks sold those worthless products to some of their clients that lost all of their 401K.

# 4. They will have to buy it back from us.

False, I've already debunked this : they will probably ask the company to sell it at a ""fair"" price whatever that means.

But to expand on that, I want to talk about the greater fool theory as this is probably the best example of this right now.

From Investopedia :

>The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

This is obviously happening right now as some of you bought the stock at $11 and sold at $20, some bought it at this price and sold it at $100 and so on.. and some of you bought it early and kept it this whole time hoping to sell it at a much higher price. 

This strategy only works if you're able to sell your security at the ""greater fool"" or in other terms, someone that is willing to pay it at a higher price.

Right now it works because everybody is hoping that the hedge funds (and mostly Melvin) will be the greater fools but they have much MUCH more ressources to go through before buying it at these ridiculous prices : manipulating the market to scare the retailers, halting the trading for the stock, preventing the retailers from buying the stock, getting bailed out by other banks, the government or the federal reserve. So i can GUARANTEE you that they will not be buying at those prices.

# 5. Shorting is criminal and should be illegal.

That's going to be short (no pun intended) : No. Shorting is a good strategy when you have a shitty company that will probably go out of business. Tell that to the ones that shorted Enron, Wirecard, or bought all those CDS (essentially shorting the housing market).

What should be prevented is abusing your shorting position to put pressure on a company and forcing them to bankruptcy as they were doing to Gamestop. 

If you shorted Blockbuster, Hertz, Kodak, and many others, it wasn't criminal, it was profiting off of a dying business. If you think this is horrible to do : this is debatable but also you're basically doing the same thing by trying to squeeze them out of their positions.

# 6. The class action lawsuit will result in Robinhood going out of business.
Robinhood will say that they halted buying the stock to protect their clients as this is a very volatile stock and they were not professionals. Also, they were issues with the clearing of the trades making it impossible for them to execute all those trades without impacting the trading of the rest of the securities.

Also, in the Customer Agreement, section 5-J :
> I understand that Robinhood may discontinue My Account and any services related to My Account
immediately by providing written notice to Me.

Also, they could just lie and make bullshit claims and will get away with this because their clearing house is fucking Citadel and Citadel is pretty fucking powerful in the financial system.

# 6-bis : People leaving Robinhood will result in Robinood going out of business.
Most people will not leave Robinhood. 

There were countless examples of pretty fucked up things that they've done and people still use it to this day. Quote from a comment that I've made a few days ago :

> After GUH moment, countless outages during very volatile moments, them using fucking Citadel (you know, the ones that gave money to Melvin to let them live a bit longer) to clear your trades, them not giving you the correct bid/ask data, the app being full of bugs, and them having a better mobile app than website, and [people] still use it??!

If after all this and way more, people still use it, people will still use it even after that because it's fun to play around in their app and now those retail traders are used to the app.

# 7. This is unprecedented, so nobody can really predict what will happen.
False, a lot of those things happened before, so this situation is not precedented but the MAGNITUDE of the situation is. You could definitely predict them preventing people from buying as they're scummy af, you could predict banks to bail them out (and even more in a few days) as this has happened before with LTCM. You can predict that they will not suffer the consequences because in all scandals they never fucking do as they're so important to our system and them going out of business will collapse the whole financial system. 

So here are the things that can happen :

- Gamestop is forced to sell their stock at a ""fair"" price. If they refuse, the government will threaten them with legal consequences like market manipulation or some bullshit like that (don't need to be right, just need to scare them with big consequences).
- Hedge funds will give their positions to banks and banks will sell them to customers (just like in the 08 crisis).
- They will be bailed out to prevent a big financial meltdown. Then, as people will realize that they will never close their position at the high price that they hoped they would, they suddendly sell their shares and the price of the stock will collapse. The hedge funds buy back the stock at a low price. They make money in the process and a lot of retails lose their life savings.

In fine, my point is that if you want to hurt them, you're hurting them a lot right now with your newfound power. But don't think for a second that this will result in them going bankrupt or any big consequences for them. This will result, as always, with them making a lot of money (or at the very least recouping their losses) and the retail investors losing all their money.

🚀 GME - 65 Million Shares Outstanding / 6 Million Users = 11.5 Shares per user 🚀,1270,l83va0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83va0/gme_65_million_shares_outstanding_6_million_users/,387,1611982382.0,"I don't want to write anything too long since English is not my native language, and honestly, I can read and understand fine, but grammar is not my thing, being that said, let me play with some theoretic numbers, check this out.

&#x200B;

GME has only about 65 million shares available in the market (free-float), that means, you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like CFDs, but there's a real scarcity on the main asset, in this case the stock.

&#x200B;

We are about 6 million users here, this means that, if each user buys 10 stocks of GME, more than the 85% of the free float shares are going to be assigned, and in this case, it's going to create a problem for closing short-selling positions, since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade. (Remember, scarcity is the word here.)

&#x200B;

Don't you know what this means? I'm not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the order-book, but do the mental math. WALL STREET BETS WON, we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end, and this is a victory for retail traders, if we want, we could sweep the market.

&#x200B;

Remember that Goerge Soros did something similar to the GBP, if you pressure enough the market you are going to find out where it lacks liquidity.

Some history: Founded in 1984 as a software retailer, GameStop transitioned to games in the early 2000s and was extremely successful, selling consoles, games, and accessories to consumers. At its height around 2011, the company was generating nearly $10 billion in revenue per year and had 6,700 stores. But by 2019, GameStop generated just $6.4 billion in revenue.

**ASK:** Does GameStop have a chance to come out a winner as the short squeeze plays out?

These firms could probably honestly pay out--but they don't want to lose! They want to win, and stay standing when they should have gone bankrupt. When they should have paid out!

Now--they're likely facing a lot of legal pressure. There are investigations underway--and the government could come up with some pernicious lie about ""bailing out the people who invested"" when what they really mean is ""keeping a vested interest in the parasitic banking world"". WE the People should be the bank of America!

I don't want hush money!

So, under the table, they're buying up all of your calls. Then they're gonna cover their shorts to drive up the price and exercise their options. And they're buying up your puts--and they'll profit on the way down.

&#x200B;

**Brokers Stay Locked Down Indefinitely:**

This is basically the only scenario I see Wall Street winning in. In this case they slowly buy up shares while eliminating any external buying pressure and reducing the market to low volume selling pressure.

&#x200B;

I find this to be rather unlikely due to the utter shitstorm of a response brokers received yesterday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Everyone Holds Indefinitely**

Very similar scenario to above but we all hold until brokers are forced to return to normalcy. Shorts burn billions a day. Eventually they cave. We win.

&#x200B;

Idk how likely this is. Prisoner's Dilemma and all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Brokers Fix Their Shit Soon**

If brokers fix their shit and return to normal there will be a huge influx of buying launching the price to the moon. Shorts will have to cover. We win

&#x200B;

This is the ideal scenario and arguably the most likely given regulatory pressure.

&#x200B;

**Some Combination of the Above**

With some combination of the above where we limit selling pressure and brokers slowly return to normalcy while shorts continue doubling down we may see a long, drawn out Tesla-like squeeze.

&#x200B;

I rate this similarly likely to ""**Brokers Fix Their Shit Soon**""

&#x200B;

Basically, we win in three out of four scenarios.

I'd put rockets but I'm retarded and don't know how on a laptop.

Each morning AMD spikes up and after that it gets beaten down and it is bleeding till close.

It felt like there was a manipulation going, but now with GME, BB, NOK, ... surging, we finally see that AMD is being manipulated as hell.

AMD hasn't had a significant bullrun like the onces mentioned before, but u clearly see that Wallstreet is scared of a potential move coming.

They have been dragging us down for a while now and it is holding back the potential growth a company can make. I am glad the GME move has revealed the underlying system whereby the rich are getting richer by dragging down companies.

I hope we won't give up and i pray for more tears from billionaires to come.",2021-01-30 07:00:53

I've commented before about what trash this company is, and what trash their fucking app. is.

This is the equivalent of telling you that now you're only allowed to sell, not buy, because Citadel got on the wrong side of these trades when you made them.

Robinhood does not send your trades to the exchange.  They send them directly to Citadel or one of three or four other market makers.  You're betting directly against Robinhood when you use it.  They clear their own trades.

It's a total sham, and they are exactly the antithesis of what they bill themselves as.  They are designed for these big money players to make money, and for you to lose.

Get a fucking Fidelity account.  They send your trade to the exchange, and pay for that.  They don't get paid for order flow.  They're not on the other side of your trade, so they have *no incentive* to tell you that you can't buy something, *because they need you to sell it to them, instead*.",2021-01-30 07:10:54

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 29, 2021 after market close)",518,l84b0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l84b0g/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan/,100,1611983398.0,"* After a hiatus due to GME craze, reeeeecaps are back for a limited time. The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)",2021-01-30 07:09:58

The idea that it will take shorts many days to close their positions seems absurd to me when you look at the volume numbers. 

S3 Partners estimates that the current short interest is 113.31% 

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20

What the Fintel and S3 Partners data tells me is that some shorts have closed their positions over the past week and been replaced by new shorts. I don't think Melvin Capital and Shitron were lying when they said they closed their positions. They have been replaced by other hedge funds. S3 Partners shares this view.

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355234358194556928?s=20

I want to dispel the notion that shorts can't possibly cover in one day. It would be a colossal rip the likes of which we've never seen before, but I think they can. I personally don't see that happening unless fear takes hold and enough of them decide to close their shorts at the same time. These guys have deep pockets though. We already knew that. Many of them entered at the highs or rolled their shorts to higher numbers. They can afford to wait, but so can we. This is simultaneously a game of chicken and musical chairs. Nobody here seriously believes that GameStop is currently worth these prices, but it doesn't matter. We knew this was a risky play from the beginning. Short interest is still over 100% of the float, meaning that when the music stops, it is entirely possible for every single retail trader to end up in a chair while hedge funds are left holding the bag for once. I fully expect Robinhood and other brokers, clearing houses, and DTC bullshit to continue along with media FUD. When that happened yesterday, people panicked, paper handed, and sold, allowing 5 million shorts to close their positions. The hedge funds are betting on YOU losing this game of chicken.

I think we have been in the short squeeze for a while now. The question is how it ends. The current short interest is still fairly high as some hedge funds have either doubled down or rotated out and new ones have taken their place. I expect that to continue. I'm not sure there's going to be a meteoric rise as hedge funds panic and trample each other in a run for the exits, but I think it's certainly possible for it to happen in one day. It may just continue along the current trajectory as they slowly close out their short positions. If they do it slowly, there won't be a painful rip. But, there is still rocket fuel left.

I don't know how this thing ends. I just wanted you to have as much information as possible, because I love you retards.

Maybe there was a post, maybe there wasn't but it was deleted. I am so proud of you all 

Hello ladies and gents,

What a week. What. A. Week. Congrats to all of you that held. To all you that sold, thanks for the shares, I'll send you a personalized postcard from Mars.

I was watching the Options Chain for next week closely today on Schwab and I want to call attention to the $800c ending next week. Now before I go into the volume of trades, I want to note that the price range of this contract didnt move much. Opened at $47 per share dipped a bunch and closed out today flat. Now to the volume of this puppy. There were a total of **10,500** calls purchased today. The second highest call option volume on this chain was the $570c with a little over 1,000.

Let me do some simple math for you sexy smooth-brainers:

$4700 (cost per contract) \* 10,542 = **$49,547,400**

Now I am not sure if this is just a collective group of us just going straight YOLO and feelin ourselves (i mean we have been making a good chunk of change) but this is a MASSIVE order that consistently piled on throughout the day.

Institutional buyers getting ready for the price to continue chugging forward next week?

WSBabes figuring they YOLO on all the cash they made from closing ITM calls today?

Shorts trying to get some tendies as this week's call contracts 300 and below are ITM?

Number of #GME 1/29 Calls that expired in the money,190,l84zbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l84zbp/number_of_gme_129_calls_that_expired_in_the_money/,78,1611984980.0,"Can someone please check my math/understanding on the following?

&#x200B;

I took the call graph from [this link](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME), threw it in excel, added up the total ""open interest"" column and multiplied it by 100. It came to the following: **call options for 9.2 million shares expired ITM today**. That's 20% of the float.

&#x200B;

I'm a noob so I'm not sure how many of these will be cash settled or share settled. But if even 20% of these are share settled, then that's 1.84m shares that need to be provided to individuals whose options were exercised.

&#x200B;

This is likely very good for us as it will increase buying pressure by MM's,  decrease share liquidity and makes it harder for the shorters to cover. However there is also a potential down side as many of those call options could have been purchased by the shorters during their short ladder attacks. This would allow them to generate gains on the way back up so they can continue to fund their short position and manipulation tactics.

&#x200B;

Please let me know if any of you OG's can help clear up any of my misconceptions?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for clearing up my error! (I multiplied the open interest by 1000 the first time) 9.2 million shares is MUCH more reasonable. But still great! Keep holding boys!

Also the non angry rant parts are in bold.

We know you want to dump them and you bloody well should.

**What you should not do is initiate a transfer.**

Protect your tendies and play your positions otherwise you'll be 
cutting off the nose to spite the face.

**A transfer will lock your account and take a little over a week, probably longer as there might be a spike.**

**It also costs you $75.**

**What you should do is open a new brokerage account ASAP.** Wire some dollars in to fund it as some brokers are more strict until your first funds clear. Also to give time for the identity checks to happen.

*(Someone please post the image with Brokers that didn't restrict)*

**As your positions finish in Robin Hood (e.g. sell out). You should move the cash to the new broker and start new positions.**

I know it's frustrating but imagine getting stuck in something like this again! RH just stopped CC.IV as well.

They are so evil that they limit to one so they can tell and have the media report that buying is limited.

What the fuck reason does someone have to own one $20 stock?!?

It's a halt!

**Then when you have transferred the last of your tendies.**

#DELETE THE ACCOUNT!

RH is coming up on an IPO. Lessen their account numbers! Hit them where it hurts.

Do you keep your Wendy's tendies box when you've finished stuffing them down your gob?

No, you throw it the fuck away.

No one is gonna be cross at you for using them for a bit longer while you properly extract your positions.

**1. Hedge Funds don't create value, they can die**

If they go bankrupt who fucking cares? They don't create any value, they just bet on companies and in some cases drive them out of business for the sole purpose of making money. Wether you believe in GameStop's fundamentals and financials or not there was no reason for its stock to be at $4 dollars, and ultimately put 14,000 people out of their job, ever.

Even on a personal level, all those suits have money set aside in tax havens, I'm certainly not worried about them, we still won't ever get close to 1% of their net worth.

**2.** **HF are taking everyone down**

Looking at this week's events they're basically fucking everyone over. They're fucking the brokers who are out of liquidity because of financial requirements therefore have to limit trading etc, the clearinghouses who have to protect themselves by asking for 100% of collateral on those trade which impacts the brokers, us, ultimately the banks. And they are tanking the market by closing large positions in BABA, SPY, whatever just to stay afloat.

**3.** **Only Wall Street isn't on our side**

Who is against us? Only the crooks! No one else is saying ""Yeah 140% short is perfectly normal, it shouldn't be illegal, they need to be saved."" The world is watching, all the peasants on the planet want to make them pay, politicians from all parties agree, we're backed up by ""celebrities"" and the likes. Honestly I've even read some decent articles.

**4. 2008, pandemic, Biden**

Do I need to remind anyone about 2008? Do I need to remind anyone we're in the middle of a pandemic, people are out of jobs, businesses are closing, healthcare workers are overworked? Biden just took office, does he want to fuck himself over in his first week? And he won't go for a second mandate so he might as well take them out.

**All in all**

Given today's situation, I want to believe that the government can't leave the retail investors hold the bags after this is over. I can't imagine the repercussions this would have if we are betrayed by everyone and the scumbags get bailed out billions given the current state of the economy. It is also a truly unique opportunity, knowing 2008 precedents, to finally put them against their crimes and improve the system.

**One more thing, institutions own 70% of GME**

Let's say everyone is on our side, stars are aligned. Institutions like HF don't care about us and probably don't care either about taking down other HF. They have the upper hand, what hand are they playing?

💎🖐🚀🌕

TLDR; Melvin and co should die, they don't create value. It's a domino effect, because they don't want to cover they're taking down the brokers, clearinghouses, the market, us, ultimately the banks. The world is watching, everyone is on our side but them. 2008 memories, pandemic (distressed population and economy), Biden has been in office for 1 week. Isn't it in everyone's best interest that they don't get bailed out and that we aren't left bag holding? However institutions (including HF) own 70% of GameStop, even if it all goes well, we could still be fucked over, what hand are they playing?

They also bought calls that expired on Friday to profit when the stock went back up.

What's to stop the hedge funds from continuing this strategy until they drive the price down enough and get enough profit from calls FDs so that a squeeze won't happen?

These are the same people that colluded with Charter Communications back in the day, in what is fondly called “the Summer of Love”. They’ve been able to charge us monopoly prices by divvying out the map and deciding to only provide cable in certain areas of the map, so if you’re in those areas you have one little choice. This allows them to make the price anything they way. Although we have Netflix and slightly more cable options, till this day our internet and broadband providers are 10x slower and 10x more expensive than countries like South Korea. They have no business telling us that we’re doing is immoral or criminal!! Especially when we take down evil suits named Melvin *spits out of respect*.

All throughout this, CNBC seemed to be the main perpetrator of the hedge fund narrative because they are the worst of the worst and defend establishment assholes like themselves. There is nothing else to that. I worked there for a year and it was all psychopaths. Straight up. End of story.

At some point, Gamestop is likely going to offer stock/rights/whatever to capitalize on their increased value. This is a good thing for the company, and for shareholders. 

For the company, they can make a fairly small offering and gain a ton of money to bankroll future growth or their pivot to e-commerce. For the shareholders, it serves as a floor on the stock price. Consider, if the company offers 35MM shares at $300. That would give them $10.5 billion in their war chest, for 100M shares. This is immediately a bare minimum value of $100/share just in book value. Add in their enterprise value and even the bear case is $150. This would legitimately give them a bull case over $500/share. This would force shorts to cover, while leaving the short percent at ~60%. This would still be a massive squeeze and set up the company for the future.

Alternately, the company could issue a rights offering, which is basically an option to buy. Each shareholder gets 1/2 a right, which can then be traded. If the rights are at $300/share, then they are worth the difference between that and share value. But also, shorts are then short a right as well, incentivizing them to cover, or else they'd have to also cover the right. This acts as a dividend and a share offering. It would *also* raise cash for the company and increase book value, especially if the company finds a broker to guarantee it, saying that they will exorcize any unexorcized rights.

This is one of the benefits of having a high stock price - the ability to raise funds. It's what has allowed tesla to grow as rapidly as it did. And it becomes synergistic. High stock price allows companies to raise money, which in turn helps push their price higher.

GME SHORT INTEREST - WWMD?,221,l8hfc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hfc1/gme_short_interest_wwmd/,202,1612024436.0,"What would Melvin Do?

Ask yourself, what would you do if you were in Melvin’s shoes? Would you give up and capitulate to a bunch of mouth breathing basement dwellers or fight back? 

So what do we know? We know that the media is spinning the narrative that Melvin “closed its position”. 

Does this mean they exited their short? Maybe, maybe not. 

Given the current short interest (over 100% by most sources, maybe even 250% by others) and the consensus that they did not have time to fully exit the position when they said they did, one conclusion is that their position was not exited but still remains. 

Is it possible that their pride would not allow them to be defeated, and they pledged, assigned or otherwise sold their position via derivative or other structured offering to a trusted third party, to give the illusion that they exited, thus causing WSB and other longs to sell off?

There are two Citadels. Citadel the hedge fund (HF- Cohen) and Citadel Securities (MM). 

We know that Citadel Securities pays Robinhood (and others) for our order flow. Using this data, they are in the best possible position to see when sentiment is on the sell side for Citadel HF’s newly acquired Melvin short position.  

Of course it is absurd to think that these two Citadels don’t interact or share data because there is a “Chinese Wall” between them. (Time to take a tequila shot.)

We also know that Cohen, via Citadel HF, “loaned”” or “invested” nearly 3 billion to Melvin as a lifeline. What we don’t know is how this money was allocated, or for what purpose.

One theory is that Melvin used the money to purchase calls of various strikes and expiry on GME to hedge its losses. (There is another post about this topic.) This seems unlikely for several reasons better explained in that post. 

Another theory is this 3 billion was the magical number to “close its position.” Unverified, so let’s assume for now it’s not accurate.

Given the hubris and big dick swinging energy of these funds, another alternative is that they wanted their cake and to fucking eat it too. 

Ask yourself, what is more likely: they (1)!exit and go quietly, accepting their losses to a bunch of independent amateurs riding the short bus; or (2) be the greedy AF as history has shown time and time again?

Perhaps they didn’t “close the position” but assigned it to Citadel HF, which is well capitalized. (Possibly even with the caveat of buying it back). 

They then use the Citadel capital infusion to load up on GME shorts right before Citadel Securities (via Robinhood) restricted trading. 

Capital could also be used to gobble up shares when GME went into free-fall with those calculated ladder attacks or when GME shareholders were stopped out.

Citadel HF then rides the existing Melvin short position down to the ground, profiting on that trade, as WSB and other longs capitulate due to restrictions and other fuckery.

TLDR: Melvin Capital is still a part of the short interest and has not closed its position.

This past week has been a moment where the proles have been able to figure out a way to steal from the rich legally. We found a “cheat code” as has been referred to on the news. GameStonk, har har. They, the rich have rebelled and acted illegally in plain sight. And they truly, truly believe they’re going to get away with it. Like without a doubt they don’t think they’re going to lose. They think they’ll just continue to manipulate the market, pay for lies on every news outlet, and have our elected officials cast us as the bad guy. It’ll happen.

Combinations of letters are a form of art.

Things like paintings and sculptures by Picasso, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and other celebrated artists.  Things that they see beauty in that, perhaps, others subjectively disagree on.  

Anyway I think its mind-blowing what I've put together, but it's a different kind of art - I'm obsessed with ticker symbols. When I go to my brokerage, I see museum quality and beyond, incredible ticker symbols that I see as art - ones you just don’t find in everybody's brokerage.

When it comes to buying a random combination of letters, I am purely from the gut and I know right away. If it stays in my brain—let’s say I go see a ticker, if I keep thinking about it, I know it’s something I like. If I forget about it, then I know, couldn’t care less...

My collection doesn't includes signature, quintessential works of sought-after tickers - I just like certain letter combinatuons. 

You know what a perfect day is for me? A perfect day is going down to Vanguard, or Fidelity, or if I'm slumming it Robinhood, and I just look at letter combinations and then grab lunch—to me, perfect day.

While I almost never sell at a profit, the investing aspect of letter combinations has never been part of the allure of collecting for me—I do not approach it the way I buy physical disks of video games, or sell them when I'm done playing them to recoup value...

I probably enjoy looking at letter combinations that I appreciate more than one that I don't appreciating.  But I don’t think the financial part is a big part of it. I don't like to make mistakes.

You can’t collect random letter combinations at my level for losses over many years and not have a real passion for it—at the end of the day, it’s not going to change my life financially.

Been on WSB for the past month and have been watching the GME antics unfold. Last Sunday my cousin came from out of town to plan are attack on GME. He arrives and I invite my other buddy to joins us  to discuss our  plans for Monday morning 
 to purchase shares/options of GME. 

I had this burning sensation in my soul that I was going to make a-lot of money from this. I was planning on spending my entire portfolio (only about 1200 at the time)on GME calls/ shares. We stay up all night watching in awe as GME breaks through the stratosphere, shaking in excitement of the day to come. I begin getting lost in my thoughts about how I will distribute my winnings with my loved one especially my mother. 

I grew up on welfare after my parents split up at an early Age. My dad fell out of the picture and  my mother raised my siblings and I while she  attended  college/worked full time in hopes to provide us a better quality of life for the years to come. Years later My mother succeeded  in receiving  her degree and became a special Ed teacher and was able to make enough to support us. I have always wanted to be able to pay her back for everything she did for my siblings and I, I thought this would be my time. 

The morning comes along and I am refreshing the calls GME every second in hopes of scoring a calls. The page finally load and  calls where far  out of my budget, feeling the disappointment over come me I make the decision to buy 6 BB calls instead. The Next day comes around I’m down -700 in calls and there is GME calls for 1/29 that are only 390 a contract. What happened next will blow your mind, instead of jumping at the opportunity I had been waiting for I decide that i shouldn’t cut my losses just yet on my BB contracts and see if I can make some profit before  I purchase the GME contracts,(quite frankly one of the biggest mistake I’ve made in my life). 

I run a few errands and an hour or two goes by before  I check my phone and am swept over with The realization of how fatal of a mistake I have made. The life inside of me leaves my body and I am filled with an aching pit of agony as glazed eyes stare at my phone screen to see my 4 contracts would have been worth 80k, my knees buckle I am now sick to my stomach. Granted I probably would have paper handed my calls the moment  I saw 20k in profit and creamed my pants. The day goes by and I am over ridden with crippling depression. The next day comes around I sell my BB calls for 1200 profit which is the most I’ve ever made on a trade. How ever instead of celebrating this victory,  I feel like it is nothing  but an immense failure. 

Don’t get me wrong I am extremely thrilled we got to fuck over the Hedge-funds  and happy for every body who has been able to make massive  gains, but I cannot get rid of the feeling that I missed on the opportunity of a life time. I cannot go on media without being reminded of my fatal mistake and it makes me sick. I am thinking of temporarily deleting my social media and taking a break of trading until I get over this. The depression is real I’m a working class guy and make maybe 35k a year, the money I would have made would have been life changing, and that’s what’s makes this pill so hard to swallow If anybody else is experiencing this immense FOMO hang in there don’t be a bitch and we will get over this or possibly not.",2021-01-30 17:33:02
$AMC DD (2/1/21-X/X/X),1967,l8gm3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8gm3r/amc_dd_2121xxx/,747,1612020664.0,"DISCLAIMER: 
I am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.

NOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.

This DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.

Part 1: $AMC, what is it? 🎞️🎟️

---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.

Part 1.2: What is a squeeze?🤏🏼

A squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). 

Part 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date (the expiration date of the short). The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.

Part 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?

Simple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). 

Part 2: The stats on $AMC. 📈🧠

---Paraphrased from ""Yahoo Finance"", Some IMO.---

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 101.95 million shares. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares become useless and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. 

Part 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?💵📈💵

THIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS 💎👐

From what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.
AGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.

Part 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)🏦🚫

Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, 👐💎.

Part 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) 🚀🚀

•The statistics on this stock are legit. 

•The company is longstanding (70+ years)

•The company is legit

•A squeeze is seemingly inevitable

•Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.

•The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.

•Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.

AGAIN I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF DATA AND RESEARCH BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND $AMC's POSITION IN THE MARKET AS OF CLOSE ON (1/29/21)
I AM NOT LIABLE FOR LOSSES OR THE REASON FOR GAIN.
THIS POST IS STRICTLY FOR SHARING INFORMATION GATHERED.

Holding $250k 🚀GME🚀 [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that I’ve won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on 🚀GME🚀, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold 🚀GME🚀 until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but I’ll come out on top.

#Where we are today
It’s not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I don’t think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

“Okay, so what will happen?”
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This 🚀GME🚀 short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of 🚀GME🚀 is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (I’m holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if we’re lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe 🚀GME🚀 is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I don’t know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the 🚀GME🚀 squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of 🚀GME🚀 retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesn’t like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with 🚀GME🚀, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. It’s going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble™** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
We’re in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers won’t allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don’t know. I’m just a 25 year old engineer who doesn’t really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally can’t go up forever, sorry bulls 🤡)  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again.

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

WSB: I found something retarded that cannot be true. Explain to me what I am not seeing (GME options),141,l8g3gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8g3gn/wsb_i_found_something_retarded_that_cannot_be/,185,1612018437.0,"So, I went digging through LEAPs for GME, cause I am retarded.

&#x200B;

I noticed the premium for selling a call way out, say January 2023, is 320.5, on the $2 strike

So now, shares of GME are 312.

So in theory, if I took my $31,200 and bought 100 shares, and sold the $2 call, even if I just met the ask, I get 320 premium. So my 31200 becomes 32000, and eventually 32200 after the call expires and I get an extra 200. But essentially I turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort. So 800 per contract sold.

Obviously volume is low, but say I could do this 200x (which according to asks, it's 320.5), that's 850 profit per contract (32,050-31200). So now I can take my 32050 and do the same, and eventually, after 36th one sold, I can then start selling 2, etc. And after my 200th, which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850, I have an extra $170,000.

Obviously this cannot be correct. What am I missing?

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

Buy a stock for 31200, sell a covered call and get 32050. That's a profit of 850. Rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price, 200x. Not only are 20,000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options, but you have gained 850 profit 200x, which is 170k.

&#x200B;

WHAT AM I MISSING? Where does this go south?

&#x200B;

Edit: The answer is I forgot to account for the fact GME closed at 324, and the bid is 320. So you would lose 400 per trade. Now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the Bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade, but only 76 of those exist. Thanks  u/boblawslawblawg

So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and ""screw the hedge funds"" because we were ""bored at home"" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around shit all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?


#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord & Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares & options to the fucking andromeda galaxy🚀🚀🚀🚀

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

This really says it all.

Yesterday there were 100M in 1 DTE SPY puts purchased yesterday, sold this morning. This morning there were tens of millions more in 0DTE SPY puts purchased.

If anyone can verify this with tier 2 data, I would bet that these 150k/100k/75k Put options were purchased in huge blocks throughout yesterday and today.

We've all known that they are going to bleed their positions to keep GME afloat, but this is worse. They're bleeding the SPY. 401k's, retirement funds, the works.

These trades represent capital generation of somewhere probably in the area of 500 million dollars, which is enough to get them through a couple days of kicking the GME can.

Someone smarter than me needs to work out what we do with this information.

I thought making 5.2M on mattress stocks was amazing, but 50M on Gamestop is freaking Godtism.

Second of all, this volatility in the market is once again creating a good opportunity for selling some high premium puts on your favorite stocks. Currently I am not in these positions, with exception to PRPL and DKNG because I believe the red might continue into Monday.

PLTR- PLTR has enjoyed a nice run up and currently you can sell weeklies that give you about 5% downside protection and will allow you to buy the stock for around 33.00 dollars if assigned. If you go two weeks out then the premiums are even better. I selected a couple of the ones I'd consider selling.  This stock is winning lots of government contracts and recently just signed a large deal with Rio tinto Mining (Go SLV gang). Selling 34.00 - 35.00 puts for 1 or 2 weeks out look nice.

&#x200B;

[PLTR Puts](https://preview.redd.it/rvaqjq9awee61.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9206bbdfcecc081900adaa3e97b644a0dba2716e)

&#x200B;

You all know the story with purple. I just wanted to reiterate, PRPL hit 41.00 on Monday and has been a victim of the mass sell off with no news. I expect a business update soon and I believe earnings and guidance will be excellent. For those with big balls, 40,s 35's are good plays, for those with small little baby balls, 30's are a good play.

[PRPL](https://preview.redd.it/ak95iq9awee61.jpg?width=428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d278accd24b796f54e9156640723d57b29de882a)

&#x200B;

SKLZ- take advantage of the huge Igaming surge. SKLZ is being bought up like crazy by Big Dick Cathie Woods. Selling 30's for big ballers and 25's for small ballers.

[SKLZ Feb Puts](https://preview.redd.it/y3y76q9awee61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=addd02c6e8d67818809d9e38011af4e6da248c40)

DKNG- They just recently released numbers and they beat expectations but fell afterwards. They are on their way back and they grew revenue like mad through the pandemic with most sports shut down. The spending on the Mcgregor fight might also be a good money maker for Q1. I like the 53.00 weeklies for next week or 2 weeks out. 55.00 for the big ballers and 57.00 for huge ballers.

[DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/ssesa0aawee61.jpg?width=898&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64a08b43c9ec83646ed9ed2f5716b3a10ddb6d7c)

GME- I am not in GME gang, but as you know, the premiums are huge. Selling weeklies @ 150 strikes gives you nearly 205.00 of downside protection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a capital intensive play, so tread lightly.

I am not saying WHAT $GME is. I am simply saying what it ISN'T. I have read time and time again on this sub over the last week or so that VW happened over days, and everyone that wanted out could get out. VW short squoze because Porsche simply ate up a ton of stock in short order and the shorts got obliterated. THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING with $GME.

Please, just look at the volume. The VW volume is in the THOUSANDS with the peak squeeze day over 20,000. $GME was OVER FIFTY MILLION just today and it was the lowest volume of the week.

I don't know what $GME is. I want to think it is everyone beating up on Wall Street for tendies. But I do know that it is for sure, not even in the same universe as what happened to VW.

So many people here are new to trading and I love the positivity, but these millions of new people don't know anything. I am not saying to sell. Fuck it, hold **FOREVER**. But do not think for a moment that you are guaranteed a supernova like VW. It was, after all, a supernova that benefitted practically no one. Porsche simply tried to gobble up the company and the stock immediately returned the baseline because Porsche didn't care about propping the share price, they just wanted the controlling interest. The VW chart is a fluke.

No one knows what $GME is, certainly not me, and least of all anyone comparing it to the VW, two-day squeeze.

Slightly Unrelated Note: If you want to know how that takeover went for Porsche, just ask yourself who owns whom now. Hint: it isn't called the Porsche Group.

I have been investing using fundamentals for a while and I was recently thinking of this overall new dynamic which the market hasn't seen.

With the rise of social media, this was bound to happen sooner rather than later and this whole GME situation might be the tipping point.

Thinking back to Apple and the whole 1984 ad, one can think of that to be a certain meme multiplier back in the day. In fact I think one of the reason Apple is still valued so highly on the market is because out of all the other large tech they actually have the highest MM. Buying Beats and bringing in Dr. Dre for example is something which increases the MM.

A classic example of a MM (which can be thought of as a ratio if nothing else) gain is when Ryan Cohen tweets this for example: https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934

Of course daddy Musk would have the highest MM so far and the stock prices reflect that.

I will try and come up with a mathematical formula to calculate MM better in the next few days. This is just an idea for now.",2021-01-30 16:15:12

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That’s 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder’s algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

“The company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.”

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who “needed” to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. It’s no longer about “needing” to use the app, it’s becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people don’t even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for “Tinder gold”, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didn’t kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if you’re in it for the long run, this won’t matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. I’m very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear people’s thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. It’s extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least.

They have previously completely taken away buying power on these stocks from you guys, this caused serious backlash by users of the app forcing them to re-allow trading of these stocks, but not without a catch. There are purchase stock and option limits, which fluctuates throughout the trading hours to clearly manipulate the market, as seen with $BB and $GME today.

There also been plenty of people posting liquidation of their stocks without their approval, probably due to borrowing money on margin, but typically you should still have 5\~ days to fulfill the margin equity percentage requirement.

Anyways, that's besides the point:

What makes you think these retards won't fucking limit selling due to ""technical issues"" or have ANOTHER ""outage"" AGAIN. They'll let the hedgefucks liquidate, then allow us to sell after all the hedgefucks are out. C'mon tards you've seen this shit before during the SPY put days.

"For those concerned about rumors of shorts having covered, or that they managed to close out lower positions but open new ones - don't be worried!",473,l8eihl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8eihl/for_those_concerned_about_rumors_of_shorts_having/,210,1612012301.0,"Okay - regarding short positions. Over the last couple days of fuckery, it's entirely possible the shorts have managed to close out of their very lowest postions and re-entered new ones higher up. It's possible original shorts have abandoned the game, but new players have entered. We have no way of knowing the position of the short, just that there is one. It's possible certain places have covered their shorts. But that doesn't matter. Don't let that get in your head.

What matters is the short interest %, and by any account, that has either flatlined, gone down only the slightest amount, or even gotten larger. That is the key. They haven't backed down. Maybe shuffled the chairs on the deck of the titanic, but still steering straight for the iceberg. 

I'll use Tesla as an example. You know how shorts lost billions against them? Well, it wasn't because of a short squeeze, it's because people kept buying and holding and buying and shorts kept leapfrogging their positions thinking it *had* to go down. It hasn't. What we've seen the past two weeks is simply two years of the Tesla battle vs shorts played out in fast forward. 

It's simple math at this point. Regardless of current price or point where they entered their position, shorts have to pay interest. It costs nothing to hold.

Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,7813,l8efqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8efqp/why_buying_amc_helps_save_a_beloved_american/,1013,1612012012.0,"As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds.",2021-01-30 15:06:52

Aside from media and billionaires freaking out, which gives me confidence that this is real, let's take a look at some other examples.

At the beginning of this week, we were looking at volumes close to 150-200M. That volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases, but even today, the trading volume was relatively low. Additionally, the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares BOUGHT than sold. The price is around $315 and most people STILL aren't selling, indicated by the low volume today (Friday). That means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it.

This has become a movement though, and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street. You think fewer people are going to get involved...hell no! More people want in on this, with those from Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and across the world getting in on this. If people keep buying more shares and holding, there will be fewer shares available for trading and we'll likely see even less volume in the days ahead. How do we know they'll hold...well most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they don't mind losing some money if it comes to it. Most importantly, this means THEY WILL HOLD! Plus, a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable, neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds. This does NOT end well for them in any way.

The squeeze may not happen immediately, but as the number of available shares decreases, the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover. In fact, the longer this goes on, the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point. They're still short >100% and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and HOLD. Its really only a matter of time...so keep the faith!",2021-01-30 14:59:14

&#x200B;

Alright, I hate to say it, but there is some less-than-ideal information circulating out there, particularly about the famed ""gamma squeeze"" we hear so much about these days. I'll get to that. Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or ""writers"") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math (""delta"" and ""gamma"" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, ""Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!"" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the 🌈🐻, that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press ""buy"" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, ""Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now."" The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word ""squeeze"" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word ""squeeze"" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

EDIT:

TL;DR Shares most likely already bought so no gamma squeeze, doesn't matter anyway  🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀

The stranglehold of GME longs vs shorts,171,l8e767,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e767/the_stranglehold_of_gme_longs_vs_shorts/,137,1612011193.0,"This is additional data to u/imnotatreeyet:

Pls correct me if im tardly wrong.

Thanks so much for this let me add my retard maths:
If it cost $14.63 mil in daily interest to sustain shorts at $313 a share

Then the $2.75 billion by Citadel can cover interest (assuming it covers for all shorts) for 187.96 days - rounded 187 days.

Of course since bitch Melvin gets 2.75bil  his total coverage assume as 15% of total short so his interest is 15% of $14.63 mil = $2.19 mil

So with $2.75 bil, Melvin can ride out interest in 1,255 days assuming stock stays $313.

However no investor wants his money to bleed 🩸 like that time of month, so i assume 1/3 will be used for Melvin to hold at $313 so that is 418 days

We do not know capital infusion other shorts have. So worst case assume they can hold for around 2/3 of a year at $313 (2/3 cost not every short has baby daddy citadel to balls deep $2.75bil)

What next? Buy to raise price and hold to maintain pressure on shorts interest and lock their capital. That will likely make them give up and cover, resulting in price ⬆️.

But if large amount is sold, opposite will happen, due to large short interest the stock price will fall and fall and meet the shorts expectations.

Summary this is a stranglehold between long and righteous holders like us and short mofos. Only one will get out alive.

I hold 3 shares and love this stock.

My Last Post Was Taken Down Lets Try Again How I think Wall Street Plays this Next,67,l8e0el,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e0el/my_last_post_was_taken_down_lets_try_again_how_i/,48,1612010545.0,"**First**: congrats to my fellow *{Edit:* *~~comrades~~* *autists}* . We must continue to fight and hold the line. We have been able to show Wall Street that any retail investor, no matter the amount of tendies they may have - cannot be ignored anymore if we stand ***united***.

***Second: this is my Personal Opinion, and I am not a financial advisor in any aspect (just a fellow autist) but this is what I believe Wall Street will do to try and divide us, and this is my thought process on how they will do it:***

This small little problem of theirs has grown to a point where the entire world of retail traders has banded together to create an army. They are scared shitless of what the market could develop into and what may happen next. We are flipping their financial models and theories upside down, throwing their predatory algorithms into dislocation, and most of all driven a giant spotlight into their practices and now they are in a very uncomfortable position and will do anything in their power to go back to the way things were.

**Distraction**: They don’t want gamestop or their manipulative practices to be the center of attention anymore so they need to put a bigger story out in front of people’s faces. I believe they will band together and dump the equity markets in the coming weeks, and at such a fast rate that it becomes the new focus of attention.

***Why would they do this***? Well if the problem can’t be fixed - then fuck it all - break it. Use the destabilization of the current markets to try and force weak hands for whoever is holding GME to sell, and at the same time profit from everyone else’s losses on every other stock.

**This sets up a beautiful scenario/narrative for them:**

1. To make it look like a well thought out short thesis instead of what it actually is *(a manipulative coordinated attack against us)*, they will use WSB and gamestop as an excuse to try and draw attention to the fact that the market is overpriced and has been for sometime to justify the price drop. They’ll incite fear and all the other tactics we’ve seen over and over again ***(we see you CNBC).***
2. They will use this to accelerate the market tanking and severely drawdown our purchasing power by decreasing the prices of all of our other holdings so our margin requirements become tighter and try to shake us out of our GME positions.
3. If they are successful *(and they will try everything to make sure we are not)* when the dust settles, they will then blame us for what happened to the markets. They will say how inexperienced we are and then the media will double down their efforts and show stories of retail investors who lost their life’s savings and had no idea what they were doing etc. ***(which btw, fuck them because they don’t get that even if we lose money in the market this group teaches more incredible things about market dynamics and is a better use of tuition money than half the universities teaching bullshit financial concepts for 50k a year).***
4. Finally, they will use all of this to put the regulators back in their court and create new policy to box us out even further while saying it’s only to protect us.

**tldr;** *United we stand, divided we fall* ***-*** I could be completely wrong but either way - **hold that mother fucking line team.**

***Take a look***\*: With these record volume numbers in options and stocks, its easier to bury some of the data so it doesn’t seem completely abnormal. I chose the QQQ as a reference for the picture below because it’s more volatile but all the major indices have similar data and you can look for yourself. Below is a photo of the 20 largest options transactions that took place today to close out the week with the amount and expiration dates.\*

I have been thinking about Melvin's exit strategy here and what possible ideas they could have to get themselves out of the fucking mess they have got themselves in.   


Everyday I have been checking [short volume](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) and if my brain isn't completely smooth I believe that means the number of NEW shares being sold short in a given day, not counting any that have been closed.   


Now when we had that jump from 20-30 the short volume was like 33% of the total volume which to me is just mind blowing that these people are STILL trying to short a stock with short interest already over 100%.  


I guess for  🐻 just like we want to see who can get the highest limit order filled they all want to short ATH and try cover their other losses for shorting at lower prices.   


**WHERE THE FUCK AM I GOING WITH ALL OF THIS?**

**Bear thesis:** Melvin is going to take advantage of Robinhood & co's fuckery to raise the stock price every day before open and short it down during the day. Because we don't have a large portion of people able to buy the volume has obviously been very low the last couple days compared to what it should have been. Eventually Melvin hopes public sentiment fades in the next week and people begin to fear a drop and everyone sells off and they go home licking their wounds but not broke.   


**Bull thesis:** Assuming Citadel/Melvin had a hand in the disgusting shit these brokers are doing they have only made things worse for themselves if people 💎🤲 . I am guessing a lot of people will be transferring their shares to other brokers that allows them to add to their position and thanks to Citadels retarded move ALL the shares that are being transferred lower the float even further. So as long as those of us who can still buy keep buying and dont fucking sell then Melvin has really fucked it. They could simply be delaying the inevitable and we have seen this stock go up as much as 100% in a day multiple times in the last couple weeks so once reinforcements come in then that might be the final dildo up their ass.  


All of this is speculation and I am retarded so please correct why I am probably wrong because scrolling through this sub all day isn't enough confirmation bias apparently.

Antifraud Rule [Securities] Law and Legal Definition

Antifraud Rule is one of the most important rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that prohibits deceptive or manipulative practices like material misrepresentations or omissions in the buying or selling of securities. The rule codified at 17 CFR 240.10b-5 says:


§ 240.10b-5 Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices.


It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,


(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,


(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or


(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.


This is also known as Rule 10b-5

Current interest rate says 32.8%. Again 33 is close enough
[Rick Roll](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)


So for hedge funds that are short what would it take to cover? Pretty simple from the yahoo data 47M shares in the float * 1.1% short = 51.7M shares shorted * 313 our current stock price = 16.182B $ lets call it 16.2B to cover all the outstanding shorts


    $16,200,000,000 to cover all outstanding short positions based on current stock price


On the other side how much is this costing the shorts in total per day? 
For each share: 313 * .33 = 103.3 $ per year per share / 365 = .283 $ per day/share * 51.7M = 14,630,000 a day
Or since rounding might screw us and lazy (313 * 51,700,000 * .33) / 365 = 14,630,000. Hooray it doesn’t


    $14,630,000 being spent per day on interest payments


This seems to leave them with a choice. 
Wait it out because it will take 3 years to pay the same amount of interest that it would be to cover today while scalping shares along the way to slowly recover their position. In the meantime probably some intensive lobbying to see if they can change the rules to make being retarded illegal.

Or cover, which based on what we have seen seems to scare the shit out of them.

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

## TL:DR: yes its long. Grab a beer. 

&#x200B;

Until his dying day in 2014, Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had once been the world’s wealthiest man, denied that he and his brother plotted to corner the global silver market. 

Sure, back in 1980, Bunker, his younger brother Herbert, and other members of the Hunt clan owned roughly two-thirds of all the privately held silver on earth. But the historic stockpiling of bullion hadn’t been a ploy to manipulate the market, they and their sizable legal team would insist in the following years. Instead, it was a strategy to hedge against the voracious inflation of the 1970s—a monumental bet against the U.S. dollar.

Whatever the motive, it was a bet that went historically sour. The debt-fueled boom and bust of the global silver market not only decimated the Hunt fortune, but threatened to take down the U.S. financial system. 

The panic of “Silver Thursday” took place over 35 years ago, but it still raises questions about the nature of financial manipulation. While many view the Hunt brothers as members of a long succession of white collar crooks, from Charles Ponzi to Bernie Madoff, others see the endearingly eccentric Texans as the victims of overstepping regulators and vindictive insiders who couldn’t stand the thought of being played by a couple of southern yokels.

In either case, the story of the Hunt brothers just goes to show how difficult it can be to distinguish illegal market manipulation from the old fashioned wheeling and dealing that make our markets work.

**The Real-Life Ewings**

Whatever their foibles, the Hunts make for an interesting cast of characters. Evidently *CBS* thought so; the family is [rumored](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9446483/Dallas-the-feuding-family-that-inspired-the-TV-series.html) to be the basis for the Ewings, the fictional Texas oil dynasty of *Dallas* fame.

Sitting at the top of the family tree was H.L. Hunt, a man who [allegedly](http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/business/the-hunts-a-dynasty-built-on-poker-and-oil.html?pagewanted=all) purchased his first oil field with poker winnings and made a fortune drilling in east Texas. H.L. was a well-known oddball to boot, and his sons inherited many of their father’s quirks.

For one, there was the stinginess. Despite being the richest man on earth in the 1960s, Bunker Hunt (who went by his middle name), along with his younger brothers Herbert (first name William) and Lamar, cultivated an image as unpretentious good old boys. They drove old Cadillacs, flew coach, and when they eventually went to trial in New York City in 1988, they took the subway. As one Texas editor was quoted in the [*New York Times*](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19800328&id=2Z5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=520DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5985,4950668&hl=en), Bunker Hunt was “the kind of guy who orders chicken-fried steak and Jello-O, spills some on his tie, and then goes out and buys all the silver in the world.”

Cheap suits aside, the Hunts were not without their ostentation. At the end of the 1970s, Bunker boasted a stable of over 500 horses and his little brother Lamar owned the Kansas City Chiefs. All six children of H.L.’s first marriage (the patriarch of the Hunt family had fifteen children by three women before he died in 1974) lived on estates befitting the scions of a Texas billionaire. These lifestyles were financed by trusts, but also risky investments in oil, real estate, and a host of commodities including sugar beets, soybeans, and, before long, silver. 

The Hunt brothers also inherited their father’s political inclinations. A zealous anti-Communist, Bunker Hunt bankrolled conservative causes and was a prominent member of the John Birch Society, a group whose founder once [speculated](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19610401&id=mxkQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8IoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2507,24704&hl=en) that Dwight Eisenhower was a “dedicated, conscious agent” of Soviet conspiracy. In November of 1963, Hunt sponsored a particularly ill-timed political campaign, which distributed pamphlets around Dallas condemning President Kennedy for alleged slights against the Constitution on the day that he was assassinated. JFK conspiracy theorists have been obsessed with Hunt ever since. 

In fact, it was the Hunt brand of politics that partially explains what led Bunker and Herbert to start buying silver in 1973.

**Hard Money**

The 1970s were not kind to the U.S. dollar.

Years of wartime spending and unresponsive monetary policy pushed inflation upward throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Then, in October of 1973, war broke out in the Middle East and an oil embargo was declared against the United States. Inflation jumped above 10%. It would stay high throughout the decade, peaking in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution at an annual average of 13.5% in 1980.

Over the same period of time, the global monetary system underwent a historic transformation. Since the first Roosevelt administration, the U.S. dollar had been pegged to the value of gold at a predictable rate of $35 per ounce. But in 1971, President Nixon, responding to inflationary pressures, suspended that relationship. For the first time in modern history, the paper dollar did not represent some fixed amount of tangible, precious metal sitting in a vault somewhere.

For conservative commodity traders like the Hunts, who blamed government spending for inflation and held grave reservations about the viability of fiat currency, the perceived stability of precious metal offered a financial safe harbor. It was illegal to trade gold in the early 1970s, so the Hunts turned to the next best thing.

As an investment, there was a lot to like about silver. The Hunts were not alone in fleeing to bullion amid all the inflation and geopolitical turbulence, so the price was ticking up. Plus, light-sensitive silver halide is a key component of photographic film. With the growth of the consumer photography market, new production from mines struggled to keep up with demand.

And so, in 1973, Bunker and Herbert bought over 35 million ounces of silver, most of which they flew to Switzerland in specifically designed airplanes guarded by armed Texas ranch hands. According to one [source](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921964,00.html), the Hunt’s purchases were big enough to move the global market. 

But silver was not the Hunts' only speculative venture in the 1970s. Nor was it the only one that got them into trouble with regulators.

**Soy Before Silver**

In 1977, the price of soybeans was rising fast. Trade restrictions on Brazil and growing demand from China made the legume a hot commodity, and both Bunker and Herbert decided to enter the futures market in April of that year.

A future is an agreement to buy or sell some quantity of a commodity at an agreed upon price at a later date. If someone contracts to buy soybeans in the future (they are said to take the “long” position), they will benefit if the price of soybeans rise, since they have locked in the lower price ahead of time. Likewise, if someone contracts to sell (that’s called the “short” position), they benefit if the price falls, since they have locked in the old, higher price.

While futures contracts can be used by soybean farmers and soy milk producers to guard against price swings, most futures are traded by people who wouldn’t necessarily know tofu from cream cheese. As a *de facto* insurance contract against market volatility, futures can be used to hedge other investments or simply to gamble on prices going up (by going long) or down (by going short).

When the Hunts decided to go long in the soybean futures market, they went very, very long. Between Bunker, Herbert, and the accounts of five of their children, the Hunts collectively purchased the right to buy one-third of the entire autumn soybean harvest of the United States.

To some, it appeared as if the Hunts were attempting to corner the soybean market.

In its simplest version, a corner occurs when someone buys up all (or at least, most) of the available quantity of a commodity. This creates an artificial shortage, which drives up the price, and allows the market manipulator to sell some of his stockpile at a higher profit.

Futures markets introduce some additional complexity to the cornerer’s scheme. Recall that when a trader takes a short position on a contract, he or she is pledging to sell a certain amount of product to the holder of the long position. But if the holder of the long position just so happens to be sitting on all the readily available supply of the commodity under contract, the short seller faces an unenviable choice: go scrounge up some of the very scarce product in order to “make delivery” or just pay the cornerer a hefty premium and nullify the deal entirely.

In this case, the cornerer is actually counting on the shorts to do the latter, says Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston. If too many short sellers find that it actually costs less to deliver the product, the market manipulator will be stuck with warehouses full of inventory. Finance experts refer to selling the all the excess supply after building a corner as “burying the corpse.”

“That is when the price collapses,” explains Pirrong. “But if the number of deliveries isn’t too high, the loss from selling at the low price after the corner is smaller than the profit from selling contracts at the high price.”

Even so, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that a single family from Texas had contracted to buy a sizable portion of the 1977 soybean crop, they did not accuse the Hunts of outright market manipulation. Instead, noting that the Hunts had exceeded the 3 million bushel aggregate limit on soybean holdings by about 20 million, the CFTC [noted](http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/29/archives/new-jersey-pages-us-fights-effort-by-the-hunts-to-corner-the.html?_r=0) that the Hunt’s “excessive holdings threaten disruption of the market and could cause serious injury to the American public.” The CFTC ordered the Hunts to sell and to pay a penalty of $500,000.

Though the Hunts made tens of millions of dollars on paper while soybean prices skyrocketed, it’s unclear whether they were able to cash out before the regulatory intervention. In any case, the Hunts were none too pleased with the decision. 

“Apparently the CFTC is trying to repeal the law of supply and demand,” Bunker complained to the [press](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1977/04/29/hunts-ordered-to-defer-acceptance-of-soybeans/1db5c239-92e9-4859-8a6b-12d94cee68f3/).

**Silver Thursday**

Despite the run in with regulators, the Hunts were not dissuaded. Bunker and Herbert had eased up on silver after their initial big buy in 1973, but in the fall of 1979, they were back with a vengeance. By the end of the year, Bunker and Herbert owned 21 million ounces of physical silver each. They had even larger positions in the silver futures market: Bunker was long on 45 million ounces, while Herbert held contracts for 20 million. Their little brother Lamar also had a more “modest” position.

By the new year, with every dollar increase in the price of silver, the Hunts were making $100 million on paper. But unlike most investors, when their profitable futures contracts expired, they took delivery. As in 1973, they arranged to have the metal flown to Switzerland. Intentional or not, this helped create a shortage of the metal for industrial supply.

Naturally, the industrialists were unhappy. From a spot price of around $6 per ounce in early 1979, the price of silver shot up to $50.42 in January of 1980. In the same week, silver futures contracts were trading at $46.80. Film companies like Kodak saw costs go through the roof, while the British film producer, Ilford, was forced to lay off workers. Traditional bullion dealers, caught in a squeeze, cried foul to the commodity exchanges, and the New York jewelry house Tiffany & Co. took out a full page ad in the *New York Times* slamming the “unconscionable” Hunt brothers. They were right to single out the Hunts; in mid-January, they controlled 69% of all the silver futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in New York.

>*Source:* [*New York Times*](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/03/26/112147201.html?zoom=15)

But as the high prices persisted, new silver began to come out of the woodwork.   

“In the U.S., people rifled their dresser drawers and sofa cushions to find dimes and quarters with silver content and had them melted down,” says Pirrong, from the University of Houston. “Silver is a classic part of a bride’s trousseau in India, and when prices got high, women sold silver out of their trousseaus.”

According to a [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/27/police-charge-southwest-man-with-burglaries-in-3-areas/edfb54d6-52e8-446a-8ce5-2cab5b7578bc/) article published that March, the D.C. police warned residents of a rash of home burglaries targeting silver. 

Unfortunately for the Hunts, all this new supply had a predictable effect. Rather than close out their contracts, short sellers suddenly found it was easier to get their hands on new supplies of silver and deliver.

“The main factor that has caused corners to fail \[throughout history\] is that the manipulator has underestimated how much will be delivered to him if he succeeds \[at\] raising the price to artificial levels,” says Pirrong. “Eventually, the Hunts ran out of money to pay for all the silver that was thrown at them.”

In financial terms, the brothers had a large corpse on their hands—and no way to bury it.

This proved to be an especially big problem, because it wasn’t just the Hunt fortune that was on the line. Of the $6.6 billion worth of silver the Hunts held at the top of the market, the brothers had “only” spent a little over $1 billion of their own money. The rest was borrowed from over 20 banks and brokerage houses.

At the same time, COMEX decided to crack down. On January 7, 1980, the exchange’s board of governors announced that it would cap the size of silver futures exposure to 3 million ounces. Those in excess of the cap (say, by the tens of millions) were given until the following month to bring themselves into compliance. But that was too long for the Chicago Board of Trade exchange, which suspended the issue of *any* new silver futures on January 21. Silver futures traders would only be allowed to square up old contracts.

Predictably, silver prices began to slide. As the various banks and other firms that had backed the Hunt bullion binge began to recognize the tenuousness of their financial position, they issued margin calls, asking the brothers to put up more money as collateral for their debts. The Hunts, unable to sell silver lest they trigger a panic, borrowed even more. By early March, futures contracts had fallen to the mid-$30 range.

Matters finally came to a head on March 25, when one of the Hunts’ largest backers, the Bache Group, asked for $100 million more in collateral. The brothers were out of cash, and Bache was unwilling to accept silver in its place, as it had been doing throughout the month. With the Hunts in default, Bache did the only thing it could to start recouping its losses: it start to unload silver.

On March 27, “Silver Thursday,” the silver futures market dropped by a third to $10.80. Just two months earlier, these contracts had been trading at four times that amount.

**The Aftermath**

After the oil bust of the early 1980s and a series of lawsuits polished off the remainder of the Hunt brothers’ once historic fortune, the two declared bankruptcy in 1988. Bunker, who had been worth an estimated $16 billion in the 1960s, emerged with under $10 million to his name. That’s not exactly chump change, but it wasn’t enough to maintain his 500-plus stable of horses,.

The Hunts almost dragged their lenders into bankruptcy too—and with them, a sizable chunk of the U.S. financial system. Over twenty financial institutions had extended over a billion dollars in credit to the Hunt brothers. The default and resulting collapse of silver prices blew holes in balance sheets across Wall Street. A privately orchestrated bailout loan from a number of banks allowed the brothers to start paying off their debts and keep their creditors afloat, but the markets and regulators were rattled.

>*Source:* [*Trading Economics*](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)

In the words of then CFTC chief James Stone, the Hunts’ antics had threatened to punch a hole in the “financial fabric of the United States” like nothing had in decades. Writing about the entire episode a year later, [*Harper’s Magazine*](http://harpers.org/archive/1981/05/silver-thursday/) described Silver Thursday as “the first great panic since October 1929.”

The trouble was not over for the Hunts. In the following years, the brothers were dragged before Congressional hearings, got into a legal spat with their lenders, and were sued by a Peruvian mineral marketing company, which had suffered big losses in the crash. In 1988, a New York City jury found for the South American firm, levying a penalty of over $130 million against the Hunts and finding that they had deliberately conspired to corner the silver market.

Surprisingly, there is still some disagreement on that point.

Bunker Hunt attributed the whole affair to the political motives of COMEX insiders and regulators. Referring to himself [later](https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=bunker+hunt+favorite+whipping+boy,&source=bl&ots=_35ozQB6E2&sig=VPGUSMSzx3rqvCISdwjLVqtB7-I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVjM31tKjOAhUNyWMKHWKdDScQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=bunker%20hunt%20favorite%20whipping%20boy%2C&f=false) as “a favorite whipping boy” of an eastern financial establishment riddled with liberals and socialists, Bunker and his brother, Herbert, are still perceived as martyrs by some on the far-right. 

“Political and financial insiders repeatedly changed the rules of the game,” wrote the [*New American*](http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/biography/item/19360-nelson-bunker-hunt-r-i-p-the-myth-of-the-hunt-brothers-scheme-to-corner-the-silver-market). “There is little evidence to support the ‘corner the market’ narrative.”

Though the Hunt brothers clearly amassed a staggering amount of silver and silver derivatives at the end of the 1970s, it is impossible to prove definitively that market manipulation was in their hearts. Maybe, as the Hunts always claimed, they just *really* believed in the enduring value of silver.

Or maybe, as others have noted, the Hunt brothers had no idea what they were doing. Call it the stupidity defense.

“They’re terribly unsophisticated,” an anonymous associated was quoted as saying of the Hunts in a [*Chicago Tribune*](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/05/18/page/113/article/the-brothers-hunt-they-buy-right-and-sell-wrong-like-ordinary-folk) article from 1989. “They make all the mistakes most other people make,” said another.

"Request: Request: one-stop #thebigsqueeze website with short interest, hedge fund pain index ($/day maintenance), and FAQs",208,l8daci,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8daci/request_request_onestop_thebigsqueeze_website/,81,1612008121.0,"This week brought the GME situation to the attention of the masses. There is a lot of debate and misinformation, but everybody is united on one thing: Hedgies deserve the pain we are trying to bring. The common man deserves to play the same game that wall street does.

This is our opportunity to make this a movement. With an appealing website, the threat of the squeeze may strike fear in our enemies. If we works, we get more 💎 🤲 on our side. If it scares fundies, they cover. Can't go tits up.

#So, listen up webdev nerds. We need a website for normies.

**We need a centralized source of information, status, and FAQs** A reference and guide for everyone that wants to get involved. **One of you autistic basement dwelling nerds please just make this thing. We need it by Monday.**  I'll fucking cashapp you $100 if its good enough to get pinned. (Other retards, feel free to chip in)


It should contain the following:

----

##1. A summary of the situation

Your audience is normal people, not retards. Keep it honest, unopinionated, professional:

Hedge funds overly shorted a stock, and we can make them pay. They put themselves in a vulnerable position, and we have the power to capitalize on it. The fundamentals of the stock are largely irrelevant, but Gamestop is not destined for bankruptcy -- in fact it's future looks bright.  (Lots of links.  gmedd, roaringkitty summary vids, anything you can find)

This section will contain links that are sympathetic to our efforts:

* Tweets by celebrities
* Videos of Chamanth and other immortals defending us
* Videos of that old boomer cooperman saying ""fair shake is bullshit. its just an attack on the rich!""
* Articles about what GME now represents

---

##2: What is short selling?

A description of why hedge funds are vulnerable. They borrowed shares, and must pay interest on what they owe. As the price of the stock goes up, they are incentivized to buy shares back (called ""covering"") so that they do not need to pay interest anymore. Every time they cover, the price will go up, creating a feedback loop. This is a short squeeze.

They borrowed so many shares that we can very easily make it difficult for them to buy shares back. ""Difficult"" means ""expensive"". The profits go to us.

---

##3: Current pain index

A section showing the hedges current pain.  These values will be filled in with current estimates, but the user can alter them as they see fit.

The idea here is to gamify this a little. Show really big a number from 1 to 100, where log($1m/day) = 1, and log($1b/day) = 100, and below it the $/day.

Explain that we collectively push this index higher by buying shares, and not ever selling.

This section also displays how this number is computed: how many shares are estimated to be borrowed and how much interest they are paying.

* Current short interest (in shares) estimates.
* Current borrow amount (short interest x share price)
* Current borrow fee
* Pain:  Daily / Weekly / Month cost to remain short
* Estimated available shares to buy (float minus locked shares.. can be linked to WSB post that estimates this or make your own)

---

##3: FAQS

Real, honest, and transparent with the risk.

**How does a short squeeze work?**  Link to a youtube video with an animation so that any ape could understand it.

**Count me in! How do I buy shares?** Fidelity of Vanguard. Other brokers have previously prevented the purchasing of GME shares. Do not trust the following: (big list of shitty brokers)

**I'm told this is a bubble/speculative/volatile/etc** This is true. This is not for everyone. If you cannot stomach the risk of losing what you put in, then you should sit this one out.

**Will I end up a ""bagholder?""** Unfortunately, it is possible you will not sell for more than you paid. The higher the price is, the more likely this becomes. It is extremely difficult to predict what price is the peak, or when the short squeeze is over and the prices will fall. For that reason, we once again recommend not putting in more than you can afford to lose.

**How high could the peak go?** The amount of GME shares shorted is unprecedented. Additionally, the amount of attention this situation has received is also unprecedented. Therefore, the peak could be unprecedented.  As the supply of shares gets lower (from us buying and holding), the demand gets higher (from the pain index increasing) -- thus the price goes higher. This cycle feeds back on itself until supply and demand balance out.

----------

**tldr: one of you nerds fucking make a friendly non bullshit site with some info that everyone on this sub asks 10000 fucking times a day.   Then we can all share it on twitter, etc. Fundies get to send their talking heads on TV, we just need a URL. I'll cashapp you $100 if it ends up pinned on homepage.**

I’ve made a ton of comments and posts about this with no real replies, so I don’t think there’s any recourse whatsoever if this happens.

Either RH shuts down completely “pending investigation”, or they conveniently experience an outage while the squeeze is happening. Either way, those of us with GME shares in RH can’t sell when the squeeze happens.

Can’t transfer the stocks to another broker since that takes a week, and by then the squeeze will likely be done and the price will come crashing down again.

And a lot of us don’t have the spare cash laying around to just buy more shares at another broker and forget about the ones we have in RH.

It’s a serious concern, and I think there’s a near 100% possibility that they pull something like this as it’s their only move to stop people from making money on the squeeze. Those of us stuck with RH will be forced to watch our shares gain a ton of value, not be able to sell, then watch the price tank. And there’s not a damn thing we can do about it.",2021-01-30 14:00:34

I heard they treat their customers like shit and care more about boot licking some billionaires dress shoes than providing a quality service to their users.

They also use some pretty sketchy methods to profit off their customers so once that becomes more widely known I don't feel like their user growth will continue any longer.

Also they have an extremely unreliable and low quality service compared to their competitors of which there are hundreds, that provide the same general services with better quality and respect to their customers.

Finally, the company is also facing a couple class actions due to their illegal and sketchy methods of abusing their users.


Personally I would stay away from their IPO if that ever happens now, cuz I don't think the risk of the business surviving in the long term is very high, their customer growth is abysmal, and the lawsuits will definitely put a drain on their capital. Also their CEO looks like he's still a virgin, so how can he run a successful business if he can't even successfully dip his banana?

CHECK THIS OUT,241,l8d2jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8d2jw/check_this_out/,64,1612007402.0," I made the mistake of thinking we were taking risk on a level playing field.

 The options market is what was even more messed up than the GME stock. All options released were becoming ITM. I had never seen this. The options clearing corporation were releasing absurd call strike prices and they were striking. All of them. Let that sink in. 

The Options Clearing Corporation guarantees all of the options made. Go give the investopedia on them a read. They are conveniently doing maintenance tomorrow on their website and data will be down. The Options Clearing Corporation Serves as a central clearinghouse and regulator for listed options traded in the United States under the auspices of the SEC. The SEC was supposed to have oversight of them. 

Lies were told across all major news networks. Interviews were given and headlines tried to push a narrative. 

They painted r/wallstreetbets in a bad light. We are individual people making our own decisions. Taking our own risk. They took our financial freedom away from us on Thursday January 28th 2021. They limited access to buy stocks and drove the options price down to almost exactly max pain on low volume while they locked us out of a ""free""market. 

Today they must have had a plan, limit shares, short ladders,  hovered around most of the day and close at 320. Those same news stations all point to Robinhood a company that was soon to IPO at close to 20 Billion dollars. A company that was on a future course to make more in payment orders for stock and options than any other broker. 

Another thing I have never seen is that bid/ask. The market makers were allowed to set it way wider than normal. That is not the issue. Someone needs to investigate why the bid was lowered so much lower almost all day than the ask. I am talking major movement to the bid. 

Also someone needs to look into Jeff Psaki as he was leading the credit component of the strategy at Citadel. Why was this 140% short allowed from one of their brokers?

Steve Cohen owns the Mets. So...,143,l8d2fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8d2fp/steve_cohen_owns_the_mets_so/,119,1612007389.0,"I have a hunch that Steve Cohen's going to be a little broke in the near future.

Turns-out he owns 95% of the Mets. It was really important to him, [he went from owning 8% in 2013 to finally taking over controlling majority in November of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)#New_York_Mets). So that means he's gotten to be majority owner of the Mets for about 90 days. Isn't that nice?

The Mets are worth [$2.4 Billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194627/mlb-franchise-value-of-the-new-york-mets-since-2006/) (<--there's probably a better way to look this up but this has the basics) making Cohen's piece $2.2. In order to take majority ownership, one would need to purchase 48% of the Mets from Cohen and/or the 5% holder (family that owns the team). 48% of 2.4 =

1.15 billion.

In theory, that would be a fair price (according to my smooth brain math).

So I think we should offer him $500 million *cash* for 48% of the Mets, with the option to buy more if the family turns-over their ownership to Cohen.

$650m less than the smooth-brain value of his stake in the team, but it would be an injection of $500m liquid capital which could help him buy GME shares from us right away.

I don't know how to run a fucking baseball team, doubt any of you do either (wait, maybe dfv...). But we could flip the majority stake to, idk, Jay-Z? Turn a little profit, make a foundation for families that got burned during the 2008 housing crisis and front-line medical workers?

The story so far:

So if the GME squeeze actually follows through and we all hold it theoretically could hit like 10k or more per share. The problem with that is it would probably tanking the whole market stupid hard and send the stock market into a recession potentially. Because, virtually those shares could not be paid back. It’s why Robin Hood was in a panic they didn’t have enough liquidity. The squeeze is being suppressed for the reason it can’t be paid out. Essentially, unless other funds bail out the ones that went broke and go broke with them and then have the government or banks bail those guys out that would be the only way. But I’m doing so all of that would devastate the stock market because all of those hedge funds and bankers will have to liquidate every asset they have. Realistically, it would be like the ‘08 crash but in our favor or anyone holding GME or any other meme stock that flies with it. Because, investment institutions will get drained and all that should go to the people. Hopefully.

The plan:

Now for those who might see this. The idea should be to buy long term put options on either big Tech, or actually virtually anything because of an incoming massive decline. This would destroy the market tho because you couldn’t have those paid back either, due to if the situation above happens. But wait before you say “what’s the point?”. After the stocks of all these companies go to shit unfortunately because of the GME squeeze and put options they should be sent to such a low value that those who do have money can swoop in and absolutely take control of stocks that the rich and manipulative did. We then become the majority shareholders we become the stock market. The rich don’t control the companies the people control the companies we control what we like and what we want. The retail investors become the stock market.

Tldr; 

The GME squeeze could destroy the market. Buy gay bear puts to make it worse. Then buy back all the stocks of big companies and have the retail investors take over the market.

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept ""going and going"", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to ""stop the losses"".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like ""oh didn't notice anything special was going on"" 🤡.

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

A Financial Professional's Best Narrative of What Happened in GME this Week,137,l8cbgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8cbgs/a_financial_professionals_best_narrative_of_what/,249,1612004969.0,"Granted, I'm only a back office accountant for an investment company, but I'm financially literate and have been following this very closely.  Here's my narrative of what took place this week:

**Melvin Short Squeeze / Bailout**

To understand the genesis of the bailout by Point 72/Citadel, it's important to understand how L/S hedge funds operate.  The customers that these businesses are competing for are their investors (LPs), which consist of pension funds, insurance companies, and family offices, etc.  These LPs have their own portfolio managers who examine their investments periodically and might decide that they should invest in a L/S HF for diversification purposes or some such reason.  The entire L/S strategy competes amongst itself for these LP dollars.  All things being equal, LPs will invest in the funds that have the best historical returns.  This leads to a competitive landscape where L/S funds only need to do better relative to each other, rather than the overall market.

When you game theory this out, it leads to these funds largely mirroring each others plays, while doing things differently only to the extent they think they have an information advantage over their competitors.  This results in certain stocks having large numbers of Funds as their investors, both as longs and shorts.  The term for these companies on Wall Street is ""Hedge Fund Hotels"".  

As Reddit squeezed Gamestop, it increased the amount of money owed on Melvins short, which led them to sell longs in order to de-risk and cover.  Because they sold these long positions, it had a contagion effect on HFs in the same space, who held the same longs and therefore had losses as Melvin's selling pressure began to crush their funds.  Because of this contagion effect, Steven Cohen and Citadel stepped in to bailout Melvin not because he thought it was a good investment, but to prevent an entire hedge fund strategy from imploding.  

Now, it's very important to consider how this $2.7B dollars was likely used by Melvin.  For Melvin to fight Reddit by shorting GME would have been the institutional equivalent of a WSB YOLO, and likely would not have worked.  For them to use the $2.7B to buy stock and cover would have been very difficult, as they would be directionally moving the same way as both Retail and Option Dealers who were trying to delta hedge, which would have spiked the price of the stock much further.

Logically, I think Melvin used the money early this week to buy massive amounts of call options at a range of expiries and strikes.  This would allow them to de-risk their toxic position economically while not continuing to spike the price of the shares as much as buying in the open.  This explains why the short interest of the stock didn't move much for most of this week - the shares were still sold short, but the squeeze wasn't as harmful to Melvin, as their MTM gains on the options could be used as collateral on the short position.  As they exercise options going forward, they can cover their short.

This also explains CNBC's deception when they said Melvin had ""closed the position"".  Notice they don't say ""covered their short"", as that's not true.  It also explains Steven A. Cohen's taunt of a Tweet this week, where he said ""bring it on.""  It was almost as if to say, ""We've bought our options, we're done here.  Do what you want, you fucking Plebes.""  

Understand that if what I'm saying turns out to be the case, Melvin got very special treatment from their Prime Brokers.  A broker would never let you use risky option positions as full collateral against a short to avoid a margin call.  Understand also that if this is true, the bad news is that the squeeze will never be squoze the way Reddit thinks, but the good news is that the stock will enjoy good price support for a while as Melvin exercises their options and sucks up shares to cover the actual short.

TL,DR: The squeeze won't quite be squoze.",2021-01-30 13:09:29

GME insider quiet period (v2 - insider blackout means no sales THRU EARNINGS)! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,494,l8cape,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8cape/gme_insider_quiet_period_v2_insider_blackout/,148,1612004901.0,"Reposting on request from /u/TomatoeHaven

Citron said in his video that a squeeze can’t happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (which is on 3/26!!)

TLDR - no insider selling means more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel because paper handed insiders can’t give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didn’t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a “quiet period” or “blackout” for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

I’m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here’s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You’ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can’t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you’ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives don’t hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that’s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you don’t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can’t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze can’t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can’t sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and I’m happy to edit and refine.

Edit: This is 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel , since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts.",2021-01-30 13:08:21

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is >30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender >30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay >30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it rises to 800$ they will short at that, overall, one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, they lose money as the stock goes up, they get out, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys. YOU have to hold it even if it passes 1000$! THEY BELIEVE this will be over SOON, they will make a ton of money on their shorts and they will be able to show great returns to their clients. WE HAVE TO HOLD IT! LONG TERM! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY! 

If you don't hold it at least for 1- 2 quarters, the game will be won by the last short sellers.

WE REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK!!!

EDIT: This is my hypothesis that as the stock rises, the appetite to short will grow. One of the reasons is because A lot of you keep saying we will sell at 1000$. WHY are you giving them that precious tip?! They know where most of you will exit. As this approaches to 1000$(diamond fingers crossed), they will keep shorting more.  Remember, this is not TESLA. SHORT interest in Tesla declined when TESLA became hundreds of billions in market cap. GME is still 23bln$ there is more way to go. As the market cap grows, shorters' power declines, and they lose interest. Just like in Tesla.

Edit2: then you might ask what is our exit strategy?Remember what u/Deepfuckingvalue said: “what is exit strategy?”  Good night !",2021-01-30 12:58:28

It’s about the revolution. It’s about showing the funds who’s boss. That they can’t manipulate us into paperhand selling. We will not be manipulated anymore. Retail together can easily destroy funds. Remember this heading into Monday and we will all see unlimited tendies next week. It’s about free markets we want to make it clear to the funds and big boy media groups that they can’t just manipulate the market and strike fear into the market with media advertisements to make us sell. They should know once we have decided it’s going up and that we like the stock, it’s going to moon.

AMC - What is happening & future?,1706,l8brqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8brqg/amc_what_is_happening_future/,803,1612003213.0,"Let’s break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it’s time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had “shorts expire” in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

Don't use this as financial advice. It's prob. all bs and will get you bankrupt.

Ok, for all my GME autists, things have been rough this week but we've managed to pull through. With that said, I believe this was not just luck or sheer force of will, I think there are hidden actors on our side or, to the very least, profiting from our chaos. Why? Here we go:

1- Retail has been severely handicapped through platforms this week and, even with very few of us still active, we managed to keep the price of GME above 320.

2- During short attacks, especially the last one this Friday, someone went full blown Rambo and managed to fend off the shorters. If you look at the volume Friday in the last 5 minutes, we went 2x in volume to 600k.

3- Retail is running low on funds: most of us retards burned out our money pushing this shit up early in the week and have very few funds left, making impossible to pull these sorts of transaction.

Given the above, I believe some hedge funds have entered the game to try to f**k with their competitors, make money and frame retail as the guilty party of this (potentially taking down RH in the process).

If this is true, and I don't know if it is, next week we need to be extra careful to see what happens after the gamma squeeze finishes. For me, that will mean to keep track of volume because, as soon as these undercover big boys are out, I believe that it is the right time FOR ME to get out.

There is only one reason possible for this, they are completely out of money in every way. This is the only weekend activity that they can stop that costs them money. I think they are just praying that when all of the books are settled, they have enough money to cover.

What could these weekend instant deposits amount to? 1M? 2M? This is after the[1B cash infusion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-1-billion-to-meet-surging-cash-demands-11611928504) and [emergency bank loans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-said-draw-credit-lines-214509076.html).

To put this news into perspective, when you are almost out of money you pay a large bill late or delay a big purchase. Then you stop eating out, buying extra things, cancel netflix, etc. This is the equivalent of going back through the trash to find the aluminum foil to turn in for pennies at the scrap yard that you walked to cause you can't afford the gas.

**Edit:** I do want to tell people that I don't think that RH is going under. I think they are standing on the precipise. But I think they will get any amount of emergency lending they need to stay solvent. (Too big to fail?)

**You are SIPC insured, to 250K for stonks on RH. You won't lose your money.** Don't sell and move you stocks, don't worry about it. Maybe open a backup broker, maybe move a little cash between the two over the next few weeks. Don't confuse anything I said for investment advice.

Until this week, and specifically today, I’ve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I’ve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.

THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT’S SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND
Ryan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.

Now that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.


THIS ISN’T VW
Just wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won’t sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.


THESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON
As it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.

So from a lender’s perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don’t want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.

Really in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.


CAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?
I would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.

The one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.


HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS
Honestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?
Similarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.

TL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.

Edit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens.",2021-01-30 12:21:24

1. This is a theory, and I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm not a rapper
2. My thinking is that if 💎✋buys 1/2 a share, the broker has to buy 1 share and credits 1/2 a share to the 💎✋ 
3. And the broker will keep the other 1/2 a share assuming that another 💎✋ or (🧻✋) will come along shortly to buy that other 1/2 a share
4. And when you increase the pool to a few thousand 💎✋, you use some statistical modeling to determine how many full shares to keep on hand to account for a know turn over of fractional shares
5. And then you use that pool of shares as collateral for the cash value you have to pay the 🧻✋when they sell
6. **Here's where it gets tricky** if the volume of purchasing and selling becomes *significantly* higher than normal, then the broker does not know how many shares to have on hand and might not be able to compute all of the transactions in a quick enough fashion to ensure that they don't mess it up bigly
7. So they have to **buy full shares for each fractional share purchased** until they can balance the books and sell off the appropriate number of shares to stay neutral 
8. This makes the dollar value of fractional shares in this fight carry a huge weight, a weight that the brokerage (and the 🩳's) can't 🐻
9. And through the power of alchemy turns fractional shares to 🚀 fuel

1. I literally can't find any sources online on the mechanics of fractional shares, but I think my speculation *might* be reasonable, but I'm not a rapper

TLDR; fractional shares are 💎✋ best friend, and 🩳 worst enemy

Granted it’s not the most reliable source, but I thought it was interesting enough to mention. 

This part specifically got me curious because I know a lot of people on here have crazy limits set on their GME positions. And I am wondering if that is a good idea. 

> Setting a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to continually sell and buy back, some times hundreds of times in a matter of minutes, your position. With high frequency trading this often happens from algorithms or a “black box”.

This is the time that we have to fight back in this misinformation campaign as much as possible. We already very clearly see it on reddit with the bots, and I see very blatant false information being spread around like wildfire on tiktok. This is the perfect time to begin a campaign to get as many people informed about the situation as possible.

We have people of all colors, sexualities, genders, and political affiliations here, and we need to take advantage of this unity. People of all political parties need to use this time to create ways to distribute this information to others. We need to focus on doing things like:

* creating infographics for instagram that can easily explain the situation and why we are doing what we are doing. With more visibility on instagram and an easy way to digest it, it is more likely to cause people to become more interested on something that is very intimidating for most people.
* Clear out misinformation thats going on twitter, tiktok, etc. Many people and bots are acting in bad faith and using this as an oppurtunity to spread lies, and we need to SHUT THEM DOWN.
* Weed out the fake investments that only serve to divide us. We need to invest in a core group, and stick with it.
* ***MAKE SURE NEW INVESTORS (+OLD) HAVE A BACKUP NON-ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT***
* Clear out doubts to minimize the panic buying.
* Urge activists of all kinds to put heavy pressure on the government and Robinhood.
* Expand our reach. All eyes are on us, lets make sure it stays that way.
* ***ONE OF OUR MAIN COURSES OF ACTION IS TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENTS HAND INTO INTERVENING WITH ROBINHOOD, WE NEED THE ABILITY TO HAVE PEOPLE MAKE PARTIAL SHARES AND ADD AS MANY STOCKS AS THEY CAN.***

Use whatever tools you have available to spread the word. Leftist political activist pages: post infographics that explain the situation and how Robinhood's actions are unethical and illegal. Meme pages: continue to rally as much attention and hype towards this. Knowledgable investors, compile data and try to explain the technics of how stocks and investing work and try to make it easily digestable, such as explaining terms like short squeeze, etc, for the general public. If all branches of us unite, the stock WILL skyrocket. BUT we need a plan for the next two days. This is why I think we should have a thread like this where we can properly make a plan of action and discuss our method. I will make any edits needed!

AMC heading to Mars next week buckle up everyone!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2272,l8b814,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8b814/amc_heading_to_mars_next_week_buckle_up_everyone/,874,1612001540.0,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.",2021-01-30 12:12:20

“The fuck is theta?” Can’t wait to see people freaking out wondering why their call that expires in two days lost half its value

1) Most of you are retarded enough to actually think that WSB are the only ones ""holding the line"" or ""driving the ATH"". You better wake the fuck up and smell the coffee that despite some big money being extremely short, other big money is using this ""retail investor"" front to benefit in the same way you are. As much as I understand the notion and as beautiful as it is, the reality is that rich guys are also getting richer with GME.

2) The more berserk the squeeze becomes, the heavier the losses for the shorts, the more liquidation will happen to cover. A lethal chain reaction.

&#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&#x200B;

**Gamestop last day of the quarter is this Saturday.** If they report a blow out quarter then that's more ammunitions for this. **A blow out quarter is basically GAMEOVER for the shorts.** We will have back ups from the whales everywhere swarming in.

Go to your local Gamestop store today and tomorrow and buy everything in the store with your GME tendies!

Most of you are now newly minted millionaires! So get out there and buy the shit out of your local Gamestop. If there is no Gamestop in your area, **shop online** (omnichannel) on their website. Don't play games? No problem, buy gift for your wife's boyfriends kids. DONATE to local charity!

TLDR; Shop at Gamestop using GME tendies so they can report blow out quarter which in turn will give you even more GME tendies. Its like you reinvested your dividend! This been bought up before but need to bring back up cause last day of quarter is this Saturday!

Why You Should Rethink Using Fintech Apps Like Robinhood To Trade Stocks,122,l8amyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8amyk/why_you_should_rethink_using_fintech_apps_like/,88,1611999789.0,"Hello there,

it was a crazy week for most of us due to GME and other volatile stocks. Companies standing behind trading apps like Robinhood have imposed restrictions on trading GME stocks. Where to trade if not on Robinhood? 

Look for trading accounts via banks like brokerage checking accounts. Banks charge fees but you are going to be sure you won't get fucked by them just like by Robinhood or Trading 212 fintechs.

If you're using trading apps to invest in stocks at least read terms of services so you would know what to expect if shit hits the fan. Some brokers have their headquarters in financial havens like Cayman Islands. Did you know that? That is why I chose banks.

There is a lot of pros for using banks to invest:

* When you make an order through bank you have certainity that your order will be executed instantly on the market
* Banks don't sell data about your trades to hedge funds
* There is no conflict of interest beetwen you as an investor and your bank becouse it charges fee, so the more you make the more bank makes - win - win situation (they have no interest to fuck you, they want you to make more and more money)
* Banks can provide a lot of analytic tools and real, fast support in case of some issues

I hope you are going to rethink using frauded brokers like Robinhood or Trading 212, they don't play fair, they fuck us so why shouldn't we fuck them by denying to use them and destroying their reputation?

I wish y'all calm weekend and huge profits next week! 🚀",2021-01-30 11:43:09

There are literally not enough shares available for Melvins side of the bet to work out. The math just simply doesn’t check out for him. This whole situation wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t make a horrible bet. 

If we all have $69,420 sell orders (imo, this is a very conservative and fair entry point for GME investors) then when Melvin starts closing their massive positions, the market will be absolutely flooded with buy orders. Eventually, those buy orders will find our $69,420 wall and eat it right up. The supply of shares to fulfill his side of the bet literally doesn’t exist. There aren’t enough shares—so theoretically, the price can go infinitely. In two months, you can invent a number and then request that number for your shares—Melvins gotta pay it.

&#x200B;

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today. ([1/29/21 - The Great Battle For Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b6t7/12921_the_battle_for_valhalla_gammainfinity/)) While I believe a Gamma squeeze in fact occurred, it was curtailed and did not catalyze the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) because brokerages like ROBINHOOD intentionally limited our ability to buy shares/apply pressure to the shorts 🩳AKA 👿Melvin Capital AKA 👿Citadel LLC.

&#x200B;

To be clear:

&#x200B;

[Melvin Capital 👿](https://preview.redd.it/f3wgl6mswde61.jpg?width=326&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa66ee90c72d260693450cd2be6d5bcb022960b)

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: 🚀)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” (👿CITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS 🌈🐻 that they are in bed with (their real customers - 👿CITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich—it is ass backwards.

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed 🙌🏻💎thus far. Thank you for holding. You are truly retarded and I salute you. And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValue🤴, with the utmost respect. We fought valiantly in ""The Great Battle for Valhalla"" today. And it is very promising that EVEN DESPITE Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post. But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.

&#x200B;

If you sold like a paper handed pussy 📄🤚🏻🙀, then you are not a true WSB autist soldier. You are not one of us. Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

&#x200B;

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**

&#x200B;

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  **(EDIT: Transferring will lock up your shares/portfolio until the transfer is complete, which could take a week or so; so only transfer now if you are ok with that—I am just so disgusted with RH at this point that I almost don't care and will be diamond handing my shares for more than a week most likely anyways).**  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS. I am personally transferring to **(EDIT) FIDELITY** unless you tards have a better suggestion.

&#x200B;

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today. I know you were scared. But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**

&#x200B;

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.

**HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

&#x200B;

Shortage? YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE. Over 100% shares are still shorted. Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position. That is total bullshit.

&#x200B;

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN 🤪? ([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

>The chaos we saw this last week was due to a squeeze experienced by the hedges that were holding a lot of naked GME shorts that did not have cash or stock on hand to cover their position when the stock blew up. A lot of other funds may still be in deep in covered shorts (they hold actual stock in addition to what they borrowed and short sold) which is pretty safe and neutral. Some may have small naked short positions and they may be seeking small share buys to cover or close them, or simply cashing them out for a loss isn't a major hit. Many of these short positions don't have a fixed timeline and are stable so long as the short continues to pay interest. Today GME was pretty quiet and I think the fluctuations were due to half of WSB selling and the other half buying.

I think the major squeeze is squoze. Certainly most of the major bleeding by the hedge funds over GME is done, as any of them with any sort of exposure and brain cells are covering if they weren't already. Some hedge fund managers actually know how to hedge.

Upshot is...this isn't going to go down like the VW short squeeze in 2008. Back then only a few players controlled the vast majority of the stock. In the GME situation the stock and shorts are dispersed over far more organizations and individuals.

If you have information or data to the contrary, I'd love to see it.

THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.**

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

How Clearing Demands Helped Ground the WallStreetBets Stocks

Telis Demos

•

&#x200B;

Last Updated January 29, 2021, 6:33 PM

When some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.

&#x200B;

What is a clearinghouse?

&#x200B;

Consider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.

&#x200B;

Enter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.

&#x200B;

For stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.

&#x200B;

How do they work?

&#x200B;

Clearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.

&#x200B;

How does the financial crisis figure in this?

&#x200B;

In response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.

&#x200B;

Why would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?

&#x200B;

As noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.

&#x200B;

A challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as ""T+2"" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.

&#x200B;

One such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.

&#x200B;

Another is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.

&#x200B;

So who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?

&#x200B;

How a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.

&#x200B;

A broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.

Where are you donating a portion of your squeeze profits once this is all said and done?,676,l89m0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l89m0y/where_are_you_donating_a_portion_of_your_squeeze/,489,1611996805.0,"I think this perspective needs to be shared more, and it will also likely give us an additional push to help keep people committed deep into next week and beyond. Throughout all of this, I've felt compelled to remember two key facts: 


1) We are the good guys in this situation 

2) We are not the littlest fish in the room

&nbsp;

Point 1 is obvious to basically the whole world right now — our diamond hands have been forged under the pressure of cold, ruthless, faceless billionaires trying hard to squash us. No arguments from almost anyone on this point.

&nbsp;

Point 2, though, is easy to overlook. This whole thing is about taking back from the greedy ultra-rich and redistributing the wealth to the common folk. Still, this leaves out a part of the picture. Just about everyone who has a brokerage account with a few grand they're willing to lose is, on the grand scale, relatively fortunate. There are billions of people worldwide who couldn't imagine ever risking five grand, and many of them couldn't imagine making that much in the first place. Tons of our fellow citizens are starving, wondering how to make ends meet — especially right now, in the middle of a pandemic with crazy unemployment. I know I'm lucky to be secure enough to focus my energy on this for hours a day.

&nbsp;

I've been here since around 2014 and I love this community. Now we have an opportunity to do some good, and to simultaneously show the world that our money is, literally, where our mouth is: that we truly **believe** in the principle of not being excessively greedy, and allowing those in less fortunate positions to share in the wealth. This is why I'm committing to donating at least 5% of my profits to St Jude Children's Hospital, and another 5% to Water.org, after I sell GME for $42069 a share. Who's in?

We know the talking heads on CNBC and other sites have been saying they can end the squeeze by offering shares to the shorts.  Momentum would stop and company could pay down debt, become investment grade, invest in business transformation.

But what about a direct listing to the public (no companies or institutions), maybe 5MM shares with a maximum ~10 shares per individual at some lower price.  They could build additional support for the company and its future, wouldn't dilute the stock significantly, and would not help the shorts get an easy bailout.  They can get much needed capital and keep our movement going.

Positive spiral up, and brings in new people to love and root for the company.

(Don't worry, I'm safe by virtue of having a dad in IT who foolishly believes I deserve to survive off my two kitchen jobs like some pinko commie).

If I could have made it in, I would have pulled out just enough for some minor financial security, maybe a few thousand or 10k's (I used to make $1600 a month working 80 hour weeks and I've still never had multiple thousands at once, so I assume that's the ""normal people range""); and then I would not have tried to game the squeeze at all.

It's been a combination of coming of age exactly during the post-housing world (I was literally graduating at the time), a very long and constant stream of bad luck and mental health issues (sadly not stupidity or I would've ended up here), and just being stuck on low rungs for everything because I started on the low rungs and only people on higher rungs can climb rungs. Rungs doesn't sound like a word anymore. Ruuuuuungs. Wrungs.

I realize that there are worst-case scenarios where the entire market implodes, and as one of the little guys I'm probably going to be hurt by that. I realize that if you guys win, you'll be the new suits. Hell I know that some of you are already wearing nice pants. But fuck it. Fuck the people who treat human lives like a game, AND cheat at that game, AND are bad at it and just don't fucking care and don't have to. People need to learn there are consequences.

I'm anxious and scared of the possibility of the entire market disintegrating and the world becoming a post-apocalyptic hellscape instead of the current during-apocalypse hellscape. I'm defeated by the likelihood that I will wake up one day and things will have returned to normal and nothing will change. I'm dissociating because this is such a huge historical event and I'm just watching it in fucking real time while I play Animal Crossing. I'm annoyed because I'm just listing my emotions and the reasons I feel them and that seems lazy and boring and you guys probably don't even understand what letters are.

I was long GME before the revolt, for sound, logical reasons. I knew retail was hurting because of covid, but the company's valuation was ridiculously low. Only a few hundred mil mkt cap. Dirt cheap. I traded it from 6 to 7. Then from 9 to 12. Made a day trade for a few hundred bucks. 
Then wsb started talking about GME. And more GME. I became wary. ""Reverse wsb"" they said. I was still bullish when it was trading around and 20 bucks a share, but thought I'd play it safe. I sold a put and got exerciced. Sold it back to market to break even. Gme posts started flooding my reddit feed. Dd this, dd that.

These last two days we’ve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don’t think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I’ve read a few things, and correct me if I’m mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH’s inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they’re restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH’s margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH’s, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let’s ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don’t, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn’t have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can’t take your trade, because they’d be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they’ve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here’s the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I’m wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail’s most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there’s a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There’s also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we’ve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this.

It’s becoming clearer and clearer what is coming in the future. As Robinhood restricts purchases on owning more than 1 share in multiple tickers, we can extrapolate why they are pulling every illegal move in the book.

They are out of money. You’ve heard liquidity crisis, well it means they don’t have enough money to pay for our fair legally made gains. Hence the $1 Billion dollar infusion. Decimating the clearing house may restructure parts of the economy, but it was never our fault.

Melvin, Citadel, all these short positions took on a stupid bet. We’ve been taught to never go full retard but that exactly what they’ve been doing, shorting over +100% of the physical shares. Their bad investment cannot be blamed on us small investors just because we bought the stock we like.

Now they’re taking proactive, not reactive measures because they know what is to come. Forcing low prices to scoop up users who’ve invested on margin. Selling to each other to simulate a sell off that will never come. Literally saying you can’t buy the most basic investment, a single share. 

For now, we hold. Everyday we hold, they lose billions. Every day they lose billions due to their own position, we inch closer to the inevitable payout. A payout they can’t afford. If they continue to hold their losing position, what is to come is bankruptcy. The upside is, we can hold this stock longer than they can take on debt.

“We can stay retarded longer than they can remain solvent” is not a joke considering their retarded position.
Here’s some post I stole of some nerd on the internet: 

In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares' worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight.

So when Citadel and Robinhood can’t pay out, despite telling people to shut up and sell, remember it was never our fault. 

Position: 24 shares of GME, not selling until I see billionaires go homeless for betting against Americans

Enjoy your weekend fucking idiots. Go spend some time with your family.

P.S. And to the SEC, you have a choice. Either restrict Americans from buying a single share on the free market setting a precedent of market manipulation or force shorts to close out some of their mind-numbingly stupid positions just like they did to us.

Edit: I see your concerns about what happens if they bankrupt or the stock plummets. Your cash is insured up to a certain amount $250,000 if a bankruptcy occurs. 
The stock will only plummet if people mass sell, but it’s not happening. The news, the movement all 🚀fuel imo. Don’t sell, we are stronger together.

Silver is the most manipulated and corrupted market in Wall Street. Big hedges have been suppressing the price for years to hide inflation from there corrupt friends at the FED and ultimately have leveraged hundreds of times more paper silver than actually silver in existence. 

Silver is in more demand then ever and the supply will only shrink. In silver highs the price in today’s money would be 600$-1000$. And now it floats at 25$ when the highs in the 80s where in the 50$ range. It is so absurd and if we can all recognize this we truly could take down the entire establishment starting from the hedges down all the way to our corrupted federal reserve that has literally printed most of the money supply in the past year, which in theory should send silver flying to the moon but is being suppressed by the crooks on Wall Street to hide inflation and make you poorer.

Hey GME gang, I've been trying to figure why I'm feeling sour when I'm sitting here on a Friday, enjoying a 10 bagger on my GME plays and a celebratory tumbler of whiskey. It certainly has everything to do with Robinhood--those fuckers sold my $310 call expiring today at 11:09 a.m. PT with no notice, no questions, nothing (you might recognize 11:09 a.m. PT as basically the low point of the day; that option was worth about $10k at 3:55 today) and they sold it for a grand. Thanks, fuckers!

But no, that's not the reason I'm writing this post. I'm writing because I'm pissed off about the screenshot I stole from another post by u/tsukune_surprise. I'm sure we all know about the infamous ladder selling by now that hedge funds use to force down the price to artificial lows. What's eating me up is that, while they certainly employed this bullshit tactic before in our run from $20 to $300+ at present, the results have never been so dramatic as they were today and yesterday. You all know the reason--up until yesterday, WSB and our allies would buy back those shares right away, on the cheap. Now, of course, I'm guessing at least half of our people can't hardly do shit but watch it crash thanks to Robinhood and others who suspended buying in GME.

You can see it plainly in the level two data when ladder selling occurs. To put it bluntly, there are virtually **no buyers and only sellers**. We all know there's no shortage of demand for shares, but the price continues to drop. These fuckers are gaming the system to spite us and if we sit on our hands, there's nothing we can do about it.

So here's the rub: Get off your butt, pick up your phone, log onto your computer, do whatever you have to to #DumpRobinhood and get on a platform that actually supports its people.

Shorty is a politically connected trust fund asshole who got into Harvard/Yale on legacy. You never worked a day in your life, but your congressman/hedgefund daddy gets you a job at Citadel because your daddy is friends with the head muckity muck and then you go on to start a long/short hedge fund that invests in fruits. 

You want to buy a shiny apple at $120 thinking it will be $130, but you don't want to just buy a shiny apple with your own money - you want to buy the apple with someone else's money, so you borrow 3 oranges from some reddit retard who thinks you have his best interest at heart. You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. 

This works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges borrowed outstanding now 70.

This is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). 

However, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth $195... So what is your account worth? Negative.

How? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $325 each and its only the first week...

There are enough posts here to show how shitty they are and how they are fucking us over, so I feel like I don't need to get into the why of what I'm proposing.

I've been here long enough to remember people saying ""not RH, don't understand"" to posts from WeBull or Fidelity or whatever the fuck you non-US people use. 

We need to end that now.

Robinhood has betrayed us. For the year I have commented here (was previously a lurker on an alt account) I have always stuck up for them. You would hear it all the time “switch to a real broker” “Robinhood is shit”. Despite its flaws RH revolutionized trading and many of us would not be where we are today without it, including myself. I have always been a strong advocate for them. But what we have seen the past days is unforgivable and I cannot, in good faith, bring myself to continue using their service.

The smoke is still clearing, and while it seems blatantly obvious that Robinhood has maliciously colluded against us, nothing is clear yet and despite the circumstances I like to give the benefit of the doubt. So I come to you with this proposition. While I see this as very unlikely, unless Robinhood can release proof/statements that a majority of us can agree are sufficient to show their “innocence”...

-We ban Robinhood from WSB. I don’t want to speak for the mods, but I’m sure it would be fairly easy to set up auto-mod so it recognizes screenshots from RH and immediately block them.

# Stock Market In Its Default

For the past centuries of stock trading, riches had most power on stocks. The idea that a stock can be traded on an expectation basis is a scam where big whales can bait little fish’s money and start devouring on it. You may disagree with me but first let’s consider an example. 

A company makes $100 profit an year. The company IPOs with $1000 market cap. Whales hold 40% of the shares as initial bagholders.

* Case 1: nobody wants to trade the stock.   
If nobody traded any stock, the stock will sit sideways and no-one will gain or lose money. i.e. rich will not gain nor lose money. 
* Case 2: the company is popular and people look to buy at IPO.  
Obviously in this case, stock prices will increase with little guy’s $110, $120 bid until riches start selling their stock at $200. If the stock gets sold back to $100, all of the little guys lost money while whales gained profit even when the stock price(our baseline case) has remained the same. 
* Case 3: the company is performing poorly, and less people want the stock.  
In this case, rich people will sell for $100, $90, $80... and only little guys will buy in the stocks with decreasing stock price. The rich people who initially bought the stock in at $50 or less has still come out of profit while little guys lose money due to the decreasing stock prices. 

See how whales as initial bagholders always win money!

Wait, this is too much math! I don’t get it!  
Don’t worry. I’ll give a simple summary. Whales can initially invest in a company for a way lower price than us. Once the company IPOs they build up their wealth over little guy’s money flooding into the stock. Notice that stock market is ultimately a zero sum game, and odds are in favor of whales who had early invested in the company.


Some may argue the above is false given that more people tend to hold the stock over time with an expectation. Now, here is what is interesting.

* Let's consider a company which doesn't hold any debt or any liquidity. The company is 50% owned by whales. The company IPOs at $100 a share (at 20 PE).  
Notice that company holds no money nor debt. In reality, the company should be valued at 0. But whales who are the initial bagholders of this game can sell their 50% ownership at $100 a share due to the ""expectation"". This is the magic of turning $0 worth company into $100 a share company.
* But what if the company will worth more in 10 years? Then, whales who held onto the stock will be able to sell the stocks at 20PE after 10 years (whether it be $1000 or $10000).

Do you see the game here? The initial bagholders always come out of profit. They are the BANK of this system and will build up the wealth using the little guys. Moreover, the big guys tend to trade on a premature company information which gives them an advantage of early moves.

But, is this bad? NO. It's not a bad thing. It's just how market is built. Just remember, in an ordinary market, little guys will tend to lose money because the market is ultimately a zero sum. The initial investors will always come out better.


# GME, AMC, etc. Case

Now the story gets even more fascinating. In these stocks cases, whales were not the ""initial bagholders"". Instead, they held a short selling position of the stocks. Retails came in and bought the stocks, and became the ""initial bagholders""

Do you remember from the above that initial bagholders always win? This is the case where initial bagholders were the retails. Whales didn't have time to get in or had the priority of getting the pre-IPO shares. Instead, their shorts will print money into the stocks as the move continues. Due to the short selling restrictions, whales who hugely shorted these stocks ""MUST"" continue purchasing the stocks, which will increase the stock prices even further.

We can apply this in a macroscopic view. If we think of GME as a market where one can invest and Citadel as a bank, then this is a case where the bank Citadel is always backing the GME market (unlimited QE) as long as preconditions are met. The precondition here is that share price has to be above the short strike price. Then, the market will only keep growing until the bank has no more money to print. Retails who are now the early investors, or ""initial bagholders"", will be for a first time bagholders of a giantly large market.


# Scenarios

* The best case is when retails continue buying/holding onto the stocks until Citadel's unlimited QE finally ends in the market. As long as the preconditions continue to meet, there will be unlimited QE for the GME market.
* The worst case is when retails panic sell the stocks and the stocks go to bottom. This will allow Citadel to print money from their shorts, and it means that there is no unlimited QE. Only retails were hurt in the case.


# What I am doing

I am a retail myself and will obviously side with retails. I am also very angry especially at the stinky game going on behind the scenes of these trading platforms, and will not forgive them. I will continue HOLDing with my 💎🙌  until everyone🚀🚀🚀 to 🌜🌜🌜🌜

You’ve always had an inflated ego, and going to Wharton for an MBA definitely didn’t help in that regard. You interned at GS for the summer of 2003 and told all your friends about it, probably even brought it up oh so casually on dates. When you were hired as a trader by a moderately good to great fund, you probably lost a good deal of friends from your previous life, because they “just don’t get you now.” You’re in a different league than them, even your classmates that now work at lesser funds. You act friendly, liking Facebook posts, returning their calls, but there’s a nagging feeling that they’re holding you back. That you’ve *made it*, and you don’t need some loser that doesn’t even work on the East Coast.

**Jump ahead a few years**

It’s September 20th, 2008. Bear Stearns closed months earlier, Lehman went bankrupt a few days ago. ""Buddies"" of yours from both funds have been texting you, some you know from college. Maybe you’ll take pity on them and put in a good word, maybe you’ll tell them nothing’s available right now and that you’re sorry. You don’t tell them you were part of your fund's effort to short sell theirs into oblivion. Maybe you really are sorry though. What you’re more sorry about, however, is that your bonuses are probably going to be shit for a few years. They could even dip into five figures, god forbid. Your thoughts are of course directed to the millions of people losing their jobs across the country by the news, but inevitably your bonus reduction resurfaces as your biggest concern. “It’s not like I can do anything,” you say, after downing some wine. You go to sleep fairly easily, while across the country, innumerable people are forced to contemplate moving.

**Let’s jump ahead a few more years**

It’s mid-March, 2020. At this point, its become evident that COVID-19 is going to ravage the world, in some capacity (not gonna put politics into this because that’s not the point). As either a CEO or senior executive at a mid-range hedge fund, your thoughts gravitate towards your craft. It’s clear the market is going to tank, so you do what you do best. You short the shit out of several clearly sinking industries (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/short-sellers-market-coronavirus/index.html). But you don't stop there. You go on CNBC, Fox Business, maybe even the BBC, and announce doom and gloom. Doing this will get people to dump their stocks, meaning your shorts print even more money. Oh well, if there’s a positive to be gained from this whole thing it’s your fund making good money, right? By late March or early April, your wife convinces you that going with the kids to the Hampton’s would be the best choice, since the upper east side is getting a little claustrophobic. You’ll need to cancel your two week St. Barts vacation, what a bummer. You rent out a nice beach house in Sag Harbor for 125k a month, managing to beat out the other bidder by upping them by 10k. Once again, millions of people are losing their jobs, and you’re shorting the companies they work for. What else should you do? 

**Only a few months forward this time**

It’s October. Weeks turned into months, and while you’ve started getting back to the city more and more, you’re still staying in Sag. Sometimes you have family friends over for an ostensibly socially distanced wine + cigar. You don’t think much of the events of the summer, aside from that one tweet you had PR send out in July. Your kids might have thoughts, you haven’t asked. 

**Just a few more months, I promise**

It’s January. For really no other reason than the prospect of making more money, you along with a few other funds have decided to open naked shorts on GameStop. While technically not allowed, there are loopholes. Why would the loopholes be there, if not to be exploited, right? Not like you don’t do the same thing with your taxes.

**Then, the unthinkable happens**

A bunch of retail investors, led by a specific part of Reddit, decide to fuck your position by dramatically raising the share price. Since you firmly believe these people incapable of sticking to such an audacious play, you do nothing. Before long though, you start to become slightly unnerved by how steady the growth of the stock is. It's approaching $100, and you're losing hundreds of thousands to millions every day on short interest. So, you decide to take action. You get on CNBC, and cry about fundamentals. About volatility crushing these people. They don't listen, and keep buying. A week passes with you and your rich friends trying various strategies, none of it working. You're aware of another fund leaning on a popular trading app to force them into not accepting buy orders for GME, amongst others. You're  not above sacrificing pride for money, so you announce your fund has closed its shorts. You're lying, of course. What kind of looks what you get at future parties if you cowed to these people? No, fuck that. You've read all the right books, been to the right schools, made the right friends, networked at the right parties and functions. You will not close, everything in your life has conditioned you not to. In fact, you'll double down. You go on CNBC some more. Artificially lower the stock price by trading between a few other funds. None of it's working, and you're intensely aware of another potential gamma squeeze on Friday. Restrictions on buying help during the day, but after hours, the stock jumps. That momentum carries it into a solid Friday. You won't budge, but at this point you're losing millions of dollars a day. 

**So, here we are**

These people do not care about you. You're the least of their concerns, actually. They care about money and fund image, in that order. We have a real chance to make guys exactly like this hurt where it counts (for them), and I want people to understand that. I'm not saying throw your rent into GME. I'm saying you have the chance to really be a part of something, to screw the people that have been doing the screwing for your whole life. The house has been running a fixed casino, and you have the chance to hit back.

I have been in the fucking game for about seven years now. 

I don’t typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such 🧻🤲🏻 in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol 🚀) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where’s the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. 🔥🚀💸

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there’s a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn’t have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn’t even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they’re developing. The 🏳️‍🌈🐻 have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don’t fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let’s be honest. GME hype can’t last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I’m on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What’s the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don’t buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular 🪄🚀🤲🏻💎 and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it’s pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don’t believe that. I know that there’s dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don’t give a fuck whether you’d want to see it or not, because honestly boys I’d eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We’re pissed and we’re armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

The bell doesn’t fucking ring until WSB says it fucking rings. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🥵🥵

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK. I’m only doing this for the small wagecucks so if you have the money to do so, then don’t bother. This is just the only thing on the top of my head that would help out in any way",2021-01-30 09:52:26
***Broker Comparison: Share Lending***,11,l88ake,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88ake/broker_comparison_share_lending/,0,1611993099.0,"Since many of you are looking at new brokers, it's a good time to see which ones allow you to **opt-out of share lending**.

|Webull|\#2-1: Webull loans out your shares. You can opt-out on the Webull app under Settings --> Account & Security --> Brokerage Account --> More --> Stock Lending Income Program --> Exit|

**Reasons you might want to disable your share lending settings include:**

1. You don't want to lend your shares to people trying to short your stocks
2. You think the person/entity loaning your stock may not return them
3. You're not being compensated well enough for putting your securities at risk

These programs are complex and highly variable depending on your broker. Without getting into all the details now just now, you should be aware of the most common types of lending:

* Brokers reserve the right to lend out securities bought on margin (in other words, with borrowed money from your broker). **To avoid this type of lending, don't buy stocks on margin.** As far as I know, this is the case for all brokers that offer margin accounts. (However if you have explicit confirmation to the contrary from your broker, feel free to provide it here!)
* Most brokers can ALSO lend out your fully-owned shares. Brokers will do one of the following:

1. Lend out **fully-owned** shares purely based on the **type of account** you have (e.g., Margin account type). The only solution in this case is switching account types. Example: Degiro
2. Lend out **fully-owned** shares **regardless of account type** (even Cash accounts).
   1. Some brokers **allow you to opt-out**. Example: Webull
   2. Some brokers **do not allow you to opt-out**. Your only recourse to avoid lending is switching brokers. Example: M1 finance
3. Lend out **fully-owned** shares in a Margin account, and giving you a **portion of the profits**.
4. Some combination of the above, with option #3 becoming available at a certain account NAV. Example: Fidelity
5. None of the above (i.e. no lending - less common) Example: Vanguard

Please also include your source (either a URL or exact words that someone from support told you about that broker's lending programs).",2021-01-30 09:51:39

—————————————————————————
quicker TL;DR - u/tretrue3

You = monke 🦍

AMC, GME, NOK, BB = Banana 🍌

—————————————————————————


**TL;DR**

&gt;They could potentially to short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.



Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be &lt;$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

From u/deepfuckingvalue original thesis, $gme is a good growth stock with a potential for a squeeze. I finally believed in December when I bought 2,000 shares.

I will do anything possible to buy something I want now without going to a big box store. Mainly because I hate everything about them...people, infant and toddler kids, walking a mile through the store, waiting 20 minutes to checkout, the shakedown at the door and the fucking disaster of the giant parking lots...

When my kids want a game, or for me, we go on https://www.gamestop.com web, find where the game is available and go get it. There aren't any in the dead boomer malls close by, Game Stops are all in anchor strip malls. They are where your local grocery store is. In and out of the store in a few minutes unless we browse. There are no hard pressure sales, but you guys know that. We also now own the game and they can take it to their mom's, grandparent's, where ever without moving the console. I easily spend $600 a year there.



Point is, I'll be utilizing this business model as long as it's available and I'm sure there are many other GenX parents that will do as well.

~100% GME shares held by institutions. Still over 100% of the float is short. WE'RE THE CAPTAIN NOW,882,l882je,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l882je/100_gme_shares_held_by_institutions_still_over/,232,1611992535.0,"So I was doing some perusing and wondered, ""How much of GME float do institutions own?"" According to several sources its around 100%. Yahoo finance has it at 122%. Finviz has it at 95%. And Nasdaq has it at 110%.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME))

([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings))

Now I know what your smooth brain is telling you. ""How can it be over 100%?"". Well it can be for two main reasons. The first is differences in when companies report their holdings to the SEC, not everyone reports on the same day. The other reason is due to short selling. If institution A has their shares shorted to institution B, then both technically own stock in the company but its being counted twice when reported to the SEC. 

The other question on everyone's mind is, ""How much of the float is still short?"". According S3 Partners market data, after the close today we're still at 113%!!!

([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20))

So how does this all unfold? We've got an army of retards who won't sell for less than $69,420.00, what seems like almost 100% of the float owned by big institutions that can't sell their position all at once  (it's possible they've started selling some of their shares), and still over 100% of the float is short. I really have no idea but it seems like at this point no one who owns a share should have to sell at a loss.

**TL;DR: over 100% of GME float is held by institutions or retards who aren't gonna sell and there is still over 100% of the float being shorted. Flow just handed us the fucking Name Your Price Tool**

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple.

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.
6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.
7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account.
8. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
9. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.

I placed these at levels of someone who LIKES THIS STOCK would make, these were made in Canada on Wealth Simple.  These were approved and moved to my pending orders, these remained all day.  When the market closed and I arrived home, I cancelled to re asses my plan of attack for Monday.

To my dismay I was given an error, Wealth Simple would not let me place new limit sell orders in the similar ranges.

I immediately reached out to their customer service via email, a pop up alerted me it would be 24 hours to hear back, I heard back within an hour.  Here is a clip of what a polite customer service rep gave responded with:

'There is a maximum on how far you can set your limit price as the US executing brokerages will reject any orders too far away from the real price of the US stock or ETF.

Limit orders will be required to have a limit price within 30% of the delayed quoted price to reduce the risk of the orders being rejected by executing brokers.'

SO Wealth Simple - in this time of massive swings, wants us to set limit orders at 30% on their 15 minute lagged price!  Pretty much ensuring I DO not get what I aim to, not only that.. but they currently have a warning about using the MARKET SELL feature for this specific ticker.. however when a stock is moving up so quick, how can you set a limit price of 30%?!

Terrible time to do this, not only that, when I reached out further, they gave me a 'Due to COVID we may not respond for up to 3 days... I bet they are being inundated with frustrated traders..

Good luck trading with a 15 minute lag.. this makes things more difficult (Delayed Quote Price)

Needed to expose this, hoping they will revert or improve the percentage or the limit sell feature is useless in the play I had anticipated.

What will happen with an influx of 10+ million users flocked other brokerages over the next two weeks or so?,283,l87t40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87t40/what_will_happen_with_an_influx_of_10_million/,238,1611991870.0,"Robin Hood has 13 million users... Clearly it won't have 13 million for long, so we are going to have 5-10 million people flocking to other brokerages.


Someone way smarter than me, feel free to offer your insight, but it seems to me like the brokeragws that get flocked to are going to have the same ""concerns"" Robin Hood had about protecting the little guy and preventing volatility (which is all just lies for actually wanting to protect big money market makers) and start doling out restrictions the same way Robin Hood is.


Cuz I mean that amount of people influx is going to have an effect on these firms risk management... I feel like they are going to slowly make restrictions on retail investing industry-wide.


Anyone with some thoughts to make me feel better?


Seriously, tell me I'm crazy and that it's never going to happen like this, and tell me why






Edit: seriously, somebody make a long, well thought-out response as to why I'm crazy and this is never going to happen.

cuz I absolutely do not want it to happen but it really seems like that's where we're headed and it's terrifying


I mean look at this fucking list

https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/


There's over FIFTY stocks on here!!!!!! And fucking Boomer ones to like not just random obscure Reddit meme stocks.


Go run through that whole thing yourself guys oh, we are being locked out of literally anything that has a catalyst of any kind or anything that has above average trading volume.


It's really fucking terrifying there are big ass fucking names on there... Like why the fuck does GM need to be restricted? Sbux? 



Again, someone please come in here and tell me ""it's just Robinhood, and no other brokerage would ever do this so massively in any event ever, and here is why""


That is what I'm looking for


I know that other brokerages have in some cases been putting restrictions on buying, but it's genuinely been limited to like five or six pure Reddit stocks


But if all of the Robinhood users leave and go to other brokerages, is there a logical cogent argument as to why those other brokerages would never restrict THIS many stocks? And I mean totally unrelated ones....... This is literally retail investors just being blocked from investing there's no other way to put that it's not just fucking troll shit there are again, fucking big ass names on that list

Second edit: I mean that amount of users, 13 mil, even if it's split up into three or four different ways between three or four different brokerages that is going to add a massive amount of risk calculation to every brokerage that just gets fucking in fluxed with straight up millions of people at one time.... You want to talk about volatility?.... I mean again, is there a reason that no one is straight up expecting shit to go fucked up like this?


And that is not rhetorical, someone please give me a reason so I can stop worrying about it",2021-01-30 09:31:10

PSA: Moving from Robinhood? Consider avoiding firms that use Apex Clearing Corp.,284,l87rwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/,138,1611991788.0,"Brokerages must use a custodian to clear all trades. Many brokerages use Apex Clearing Corp., which informed their clients this week that trades in GME and AMC (among others) would be restricted to closing-only. Brokerages that use Apex were forced to restrict their clients to closing-only, and had no voice in the matter. (Robinhood, TDAmeritrade, and Interactive Brokers do not use Apex Clearing and were dicks just because they're dicks).

&#x200B;

Firms that use Apex Clearing Corp., and therefore were forced to restrict the purchase of securities this week (and therefore may be forced to do so again in the future) include:

* WeBull
* SoFi
* Tasty Works
* Ally Invest
* M1 Finance
* Betterment
* Firstrade

&#x200B;

Some brokerages have their own clearing companies in-house, including Fidelity and ETrade. By the way, Robinhood makes all of its money by selling its order feed to Companies like Citadel (mainly Citadel). Fidelity is one of the  few brokerages out there which doesn't sell its orders to anyone, ever.

Tasty Works has worked well for me, but since they use Apex, they were forced to restrict the purchase of GME this week and I decided to move to a new brokerage. I created an account with both Fidelity and ETrade to give both of them a shot and this was my experience:

Fidelity:

 \- I filled out the application, but half way through the process I got a server timeout error (presumably because of lots of people doing the same thing as me). I tried again and it worked fine. I also had a question so I called their customer service number. I was on hold for about 3 minutes, then spoke with a real person who was nice and answered my question.

ETrade:

 \- I filled out an application, then got a screen saying that my account creation could not be completed until I called and spoke with a customer service representative. Ok. I called the number on the screen, and waited on hold for 43 minutes (at 8am). I called back later and waited on hold for about an hour and 15 minutes before giving up.

&#x200B;

Extra tidbit regarding Apex:

I tried to submit a Wiki entry for Apex Clearing Corp. last year, but was rejected 3 times because I couldn't provide any acceptable sources. Why couldn't I provide sources for the info? Because you won't find shit about them online which wikipedia considers to be a reliable source, other than on their own site (which was why I was trying to create the wiki page in the first place).",2021-01-30 09:29:48

The Short Swing Profit Rule - How GME Can Cash-In via RC Ventures,50,l87l54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87l54/the_short_swing_profit_rule_how_gme_can_cashin/,50,1611991325.0,"I see a lot of chatter right now about how GME's current stock price doesn't actually 'help' the company, which is, for the most part, true. 

In order for GameStop to actually benefit from this price movement, they would need to tap the capital markets, most likely by doing a stock offering near current prices. To do so, you need to have enough deep-pocketed investors who are willing to purchase at that price, not to mention increasing the float could significantly hurt the ongoing 'short squeeze' psychology. Yes, there are other ways to take advantage of the share price (all-stock acquisitions, etc.), but none of them are as straightforward as getting cash in hand.

However, there is one way for GameStop to use today's prices to benefit the company financially: the Short Swing Profit Rule.

>The short-swing profit rule, also known as the Section 16b rule, is an SEC regulation that prevents insiders in a publicly traded company from reaping short-term profits.
>The short-swing profit rule requires company insiders to return to the company any profits made from the purchase and sale of company stock if both transactions occur within a six-month period.
>This rule applies to any shareholder, officer, or director who owns more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act.

Obviously insider sales are tightly regulated, but *if* Ryan Cohen (aka RC Ventures) were to sell a portion of his 9,001,000 shares currently worth $2.8B (roughly 13% of the company), he would then be required to return those profits directly to the company. This would arguably be the best possible way to capitalize on the situation, providing positive news that in some ways might help substantiate the current valuation (I won't offer my own opinion here). 

tl;dr: Ryan Cohen (RC Ventures) can raise money for GME by selling and sacrificing his profits. This cash would help GME on the path to turning around the business, so this may be a win-win situation. The other take away from this is that RC Ventures CANNOT SELL without passing along those profits, so effectively 13% of shares outstanding is completely tied up.

Would like to know if you all agree.

Interviewer:

It seems like people have really bought into this cause and are willing to take signficiant losses

why do you think that is

heapsp:

I think you have a combination of rising expenses such as student loans, rent, and stagnant wages causing a whole generation of folks to lose faith that life for them will be the American Dream that everyone talks about. With crippling debt and no way out anytime soon, you have people who want to succeed but feel like they can't. Then they see Wall street folks or CEOs making record profits, they know it is wrong but have no way to fight back. A bunch of people get interested in activism or politics thinking that they can make a change for the better and improve the situation, but the game is still rigged against them. This is an opportunity to fight back. The fact that everyone is worshipping /u/deepfuckingvalue is obvious, because he is also a father of two and took all of his savings and made it. Everyone is just looking for an opportunity to level the playing field.

heapsp

The idea that you can succeed by pulling yourself up by the bootstraps in this day and age is so false. I have a good job and career that I've been working at for 11 years. I work in technology. I still worry every month about buying formula and paying rent in a decent neighborhood so my kids can have a normal life. I have no savings and I don't waste my money. Half of my friends in their 30's either still live with roommates or at home with their parents. I am fortunate to be working with a great company, but I work incredibly hard. 60 hours a week, sometimes nights and weekends. The board of directors is insanely wealthy - I am scraping by. I can't imagine how difficult it is for people who are out of work or are under-employed and trying to make a decent life for themselves. For a lot of us, joining this community and banding together is about a lot more than trying to make a quick buck. We see it as our 'French Revolution' where we can strike back at the greedy and corrupt. Who better than greedy hedge fund managers that have pushed their greediness to the maximum level by shorting businesses into oblivion. The fact that we are in a pandemic and a hedge fund can short a brick and mortar store into the ground with illegal naked short selling and no one is going to do anything about it - well we are doing something about it. If the system won't handle it, the community will.

heapsp

I think you will find that wallstreetbets investments for the most part are really grounded in altruism. Tesla - Making the world not rely on fossil fuel and improving the environment.  Gamestop - punishing a hedge fund that wants to step all over a brick and mortar store during a pandemic. Also notice that you won't see many companies being supported that would have made the community a ton of money - AMZN for instance. For the community investment isn't only about making money - lots of retail investment is done from the heart. In no other community of investors would you see so many people HAPPY for other's success. We treat each other like a band of brothers, not competition. That is why we hold. That is why so much due diligence is shared. Some very smart people share some very insightful information without even investing themselves, if it would help the community succeed.",2021-01-30 09:20:02

Possible theory on how GME could crash the whole market. Please correct any mistakes in my thinking.,188,l87goh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87goh/possible_theory_on_how_gme_could_crash_the_whole/,197,1611991031.0,"I watched the interview with that old guy. 

(https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-chairman-worried-about-integrity-of-the-market.html). 

He stated they stopped trading because of the possibility a broker wouldn't be able to cover transactions if the loser failed to pay.

Now we all make the assumption that he was talking about retail investors because the media has been blaming us for the last week, but what if he meant they couldn't cover the bets made by hedge funds? 

What if the hedge funds sold a shit fuck ton of call options way out of the money to cover their original shorts on gme? At the start of trading that day, gme was just under $500 per share and gaining. If momentum continued and all options ended in the money another gamma squeeze would occur and hedge funds would have to cover all the options plus pay the interest on their short positions at $1000+ per share. In order to come up with that amount of cash I would imagine the hedge funds would have to liquidate other stocks. This would create a massive sell off of stocks which could potentially crash the market. 

I was reading that the total capital of the market is in the $10s of trillions but there are $60-70 trillion betting on which way the market moves. If a massive sell off happens, those betting that, stonks only go up, will lose and have to pay the winners. But with all the stocks crashing they can't cover the losses. The whole house of cards comes crashing down...again.

AMC Short Squeeze Is Absolutely Possible to and Here is Why,12109,l87d25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/,1951,1611990778.0,"I'm not a financial advisor I have positions in AMC and this is not a financial advice.

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

&#x200B;

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.**

Yes it's still lower than GME's 200 something % but 116% is still very, VERY high.

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors.

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts.

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel).

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course.

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

>Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

>They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

While I did realize that there was a possibility for his crazy play to succeed, not in a million years did I expect things to unfold like this.

It's absolutely mindboggling to see this quaint subreddit of ""retards"" be on the front pages of mainstream news sites, be discussed on primetime TV news shows, send ripples through the entire industry, catch the eye of politicians, the White House, the SEC, bring scrutiny to the unethical and dangerous practices by hedge funds, etc.

This is all very surreal. Feels like a parallel universe where our fun crazy little meme world of stonks is colliding with the outside world.

Anyway, this is history in the making, and it's awesome to be a part of it.

Listen up retards, because nobody gets the luxury of an intel brief like this. This isn’t AskReddit. Some people’s kids aren’t going to eat as well because of this movement, some of your kids. A lot of you are brand new to being exposed this way, and being sensationalized into doing it harder and faster than you ever would’ve. The people who control the game are salivating over this. Learn these 3 lessons as fast as possible, I’m not saying they will save you money, but they might save you from being blindsided by reality.  

1. WallStreetBets does not care about you. You are nobody. Occasionally a person accomplishes enough to be recognizable, but it’s such a small fraction it’s negligible. You are completely and utterly alone in this game. The times that this subreddit has served as a haven for confirmation bias in times of uncertainty are the times that the most people have walked away with horrible losses. 

2. Nobody is a prophet. Nobody here is powerful enough to make plays with 100% certainty. The majority of prophets and astrologists here have ended up major losers and hated by the community. 

3. Only putting in what you can afford to lose is a fairy tale, the only ‘unrealized losses’ are the losses you haven’t realized you’re not getting back yet, and there’s no such thing as only playing with house money. Any “unrealized” gains are YOUR dollars, not the house’s anymore. And you could spend years convincing yourself you could afford to lose what you lost. That’s if you don’t pick up an addiction on the way and lose more. 

Welcome to the casino. Oh and in a week, it’s back to date and strike. For now-

Good luck. 24@353 🚀 holding",2021-01-30 08:38:18

Now, before you call me paper-handed, I still have plenty of shares. But the news Wednesday morning that Melvin closed out its position on Tuesday afternoon caused me to sell a couple of deep ITM options that I had. These options have continued to increase in value ever since.

>""Melvin Capital closed out its short position in [GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GME) on Tuesday afternoon after taking a huge loss, the hedge fund’s manager told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin.""

7 U.S. Code § 9, Sec. 1 says that it is ""unlawful for any person... to use or employ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate\[.\]"" Sec. 3 says ""in addition to the prohibition in paragraph (1), it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.""

I am not a securities lawyer, but it would seem to me that if this was a false statement by Melvin, that it may run afoul of the laws.

Does anyone know if anyone is looking into this? Not giving any legal advice here or tossing any allegations around, but I'd like to be connected with anyone who is looking deeper into this.

I've benefited massively from the spac boom in early 2020 and have been making good progress growing my small pile of tendies to a much larger one.

The tone of the former SEC senior council member Jacob Frenkel seems to be against us and said that the current SEC should’ve halted the trading of GameStop stock all together.

And just like every other big wig that’s been talking shit, a simple google search shows what they have to lose in this.

Jacob Frenkel is now chairman for JP Morgan and a defense lawyer for companies being investigated by the SEC. He went from being the person investigating for the SEC, to protecting companies from the SEC.

SEC documents for Melvin Capital shows that Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, and National Financial Services LLC are the prime brokers(for retards, prime brokers are the ones who lend money/stock) for Melvin Capital.

https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf

Now we don’t know the specifics on who lended the GameStop stock to Melvin Capital for shorting. Could be JP Morgan, could be multiple, could be all of them. What we do know is, JP Morgan stock, as well as Goldman Sachs, and their most profitable ETFS, such as $GVIP, have shown a pretty clear inverse correlation of GME these past weeks. JP Morgan is by far the largest lender overall, not just specifically for GameStop. We also know they went long on GameStop last summer buying up 350,000 shares of GameStop. Did they lend it out to shorters who now have to pay back their broker on it? They have to liquidate their profitable assets to cover GME, but we know Citadel will eventually run out of assets to cover it, leading to JP Morgan taking the hit. Which could be why their stock is inversing GME.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, has received 5 felonies of white collar crime since 2014. We know he plays dirty with market manipulation. Not only did he not go to prison or get removed from JPM, he received a raise.

JP Morgan Shares of GameStop:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961720000513/xslForm13F_X01/Information_Table_updated.xml

Just recently JP Morgan was fined $35m for market manipulation where they made over $920m in profit. What were they manipulating you ask? Precious metals market, such as silver. What have you seen an influx of on these subreddits magically this week? JP Morgan Silver. Don’t fall for JP Morgan silver, it could be JPM trying to cover their losses.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-233

TLDR; Buy GME, Don’t buy JPM silver or any precious metals, mods should actually ban precious metals, the SEC could be buddy buddy with Wallstreet, HOLD YOUR SHARES.

EDIT: I’d like to make an edit. The new commissioner of the SEC has never been in banking ever. She was first a lawyer and then has worked for the SEC for almost 15 years. Could be a brighter outlook, but you can’t ever be too positive.

EDIT 2: a tard dm’d me and told me this “The new SEC commissioner is Peter Stryoks wife. Im not sure if you know who he is but watch his congressional hearing 2 months ago where he is shammed for lying and being a cheat.

So in the case of RH, or anyone really, do you think they’re expecting to have to cover millions of shares when Citadel et al tell them to go fuck off and they’re not delivering shares? That would explain why everyone flipped out yesterday and why the IBKR CEO was talking about covering his own ass. 

If that’s the case, what’s the penalty for failure to deliver? Really interesting stuff I just can’t find much and I don’t know all that much about it.

Edit: I have absolutely no issue if I lose every cent in this trade. This is just something that popped out at me after the close.

We've also seend reports of SI being HIGHER than it was previously [http://isthesqueezesquoze.com]

So, what's possibly happened here?

The current suspicion is that Melvin blatantly lied, which could be possible. Here's another theory:

Let's say Melvin did indeed cover, but other market participants who argue GME is not fundamentally sound at this price decided to open their own shorts - this means the possible short squeeze could have reset!

Why is this good? If the short squeeze reset, we basically start all over from new shorts being down 0% now. Meaning that the squeeze point now moves HIGHER than what we previously estimated. With MMs buying due to gamma squeeze, we could see even faster velocity as the new shorts start to cover. 🚀

So,  the first thing you need to know before you get started trading/investing is that not only are there other trading apps out there,  but robinhood is genuinely the worst. I'm not just saying this because of what's going on with them these past couple days,  robinhood just sucks. 

Robinhood doesn't let you trade OTC stocks (penny stocks)

Robinhood has shitty hours. 

Robinhood has had server problems at the worst times they could have them. 

Robinhood is pulling this shit with limiting stocks, and mommying it's users.

Robinhood customer service is terrible. 

You can ask for opinions on other apps here,  most people use either TD Ameritrade, Webul,  Fidelity, or Schwab, and honestly none of them check all the boxes I'd like.... but one thing everyone agrees on is that Robinhood is legitimately the worst of all of them.  Robinhood looks nice,  but the others are just as easy to use. 

If you're looking for a broker,  don't use Robinhood. If you're currently using Robinhood,  you should start the switch to another broker immediately,  right now. 

It's really easy to leave robinhood and transfer your money to another broker. It takes minutes on your end,  then they handle the rest. Answer a couple questions,  hit send,  and the two brokers handle the rest. 

Godspeed

Edit: 

You can transfer as much or as little out of robinhood as you want. You don't have to close robinhood out to start somewhere else. 

So,  for example,  if you wanted leave Robinhood, but you don't want to sell certain stocks you own yet,  but you want to transfer any cash you have in it, you can do that.

\> TL;DR → Melvin Capital fucked up so bad that they were about to destroy the entire market through counter party risk leading to a massive liquidity crisis. Since Melvin and other hedge funds were too big to fail, to prevent a complete market collapse, DTC had to screw the clearing firms (who then had to screw brokers who then had to screw retail) by raising settlement collateral from 3% to 100%. This led to a tricke down effect which shutdown $GME trading (and a few others) and then drove prices low enough that Melvin Capital wouldn't collapse and take the entire securities market with it.

&#x200B;

Basically, Melvin Capital over-leveraged and was about to destroy the entire market. DTC couldn't let that happen. Thus, DTC forced retail traders to bail out Melvin Capital through a series of trickle down events that started with                                                                     DTC raising settlement collateral on $GME from 3% to 100%.

&#x200B;

In short, Melvin fucked up big so DTC forced you to bail them out.

\- Purpose → Provide liquidity in the meantime

\- Makes sure sellers get their money when they sell

\- BUT usually requires 1-3% collateral just in case

2. Clearing Firms (APEX Clearing)

\- Intermediatery between DTCC and Brokers to clear trades

\- Pays collateral to DTCC until trade settles

3. Brokers (Robinhood, WeBull)

\- Facilitate securities exchange between traders

4. Traders

&#x200B;

\# 2. Why Was $GME Trading Halted?

&#x200B;

\### DTC without warning raised collateral from 3% to 100%

&#x200B;

\### What stocks were affected?

&#x200B;

\- $GME, $AMC, $KOSS

&#x200B;

\### What is the impact?

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms now have to hand over \*\*100% cash collateral\*\* to DTC for \*\*every single trade\*\*

\- AND hundreds billions of dollars are traded constantly, how can Clearing Firms handle 100%?

\- ANSWER: Clearing firms obviously CANNOT provide the required collateral

\- RESULT: Clearing firms called up the brokerages and told them to shutdown trading

\- Ex. Robinhood shutdown all selling of $GME and other volatile securities

\- Did DTC know this was going to happen? Hell yeah. They did it on purpose.

&#x200B;

\# 3. Why DTC Suddenly Required 100% Collateral

&#x200B;

\### The entire securities market was about to collapse.

You heard that right.

&#x200B;

\### What how?

&#x200B;

\- If $GME prices kept going up, Melvin Capital would be unable to pay and cover their shorts

\- Then it would trickle down to the Clearing Firms who would be on the hook

\- But we are talking about BILLIONS of dollars here

\- So Clearing Firms would be in the water and not have enough

\- Meaning, if you sell a share, you won't receive a penny because NO ONE CAN PAY

\- Result → Counter party risk → Complete market breakdown

&#x200B;

\### It gets worse...

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms being underwater would cause a domino effect to the ENTIRE MARKET

\- Remember, Clearing Firms help clear pretty much every security traded

\- So if Clearing Firms goes under due to $GME...

\- Then not a single security on the marketplace could be cleared

\- \*\*The entire market would collapse\*\*

&#x200B;

\### Case Study: 2008 Financial Crisis

&#x200B;

\- Remember Lehman Brothers? They were also a clearing firm.

\- Lehman was the clearing firm for many other hedge funds

\- When Lehman collapsed, the hedge funds it supported \*\*also became counter party risk\*\*

\- Result?

\- \*\*Complete market breakdown\*\*

\- Which is why the U.S. Government had to come and \*\*bail them out\*\*

&#x200B;

\# 4. Who's Responsible / Who to Blame

&#x200B;

\### So fuck DTC right? Not really.

&#x200B;

\- You have to understand...

\- \*\*DTC only had two choices\*\*

1. Leave everything as it is and let the market collapse

2. Screw the $GME holders to protect the rest of the market

\- Can't really blame them...

&#x200B;

\### Then who do we blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*MELVIN CAPITAL and other hedge fund shorts\*\*

\- Their greed almost collapsed the U.S. securities exchange market (potentially global as well) because they over-leveraged and shorted 140% of $GME float.

\- They made a horrible call trying to profit off of a struggling business with insane leverage.

&#x200B;

\### But who does Wall Street blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Wall Street blames Retail Traders and r/WallStreetBets\*\*

\- Their reasoning → If everyday folks didn't discover our evil and irresponsible strategies, this never wouldn't have happened.",2021-01-30 08:03:55
There will be a lot of FUD in the media this weekend. Checking in to let y’all know I’m still holding 💎🙌,35281,l85lvl,https://i.redd.it/nzzcsmufgce61.jpg,1322,1611986537.0,,2021-01-30 08:02:17
Ex robinhood user's please read this before you fuck up & can't trade.,339,l85krp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l85krp/ex_robinhood_users_please_read_this_before_you/,78,1611986463.0,"Retards,

As you are moving from RH to various others brokers, you will have to read these rules otherwise you will fuck your account and you won't be able to trade for a year.  By Default your broker will create'S a cash account for you VS RH had by default a margin Account.   

If you have a margin account then please ignore and 💎🙌 to 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you have a cash account you can request for Margin account if you have $$ if not request might be denied. 

Examples : 

 

As the term implies, a cash account requires that you pay for all purchases in full by the settlement date. For example, if you bought 1,000 shares of ABC stock on Monday for $10,000, you would need to have $10,000 in cash available in your account to pay for the trade on settlement date. According to industry standards, most securities have a settlement date that occurs on trade date plus 2 business days (T+2). That means that if you buy a stock on a Monday, settlement date would be Wednesday.

If you plan to trade strictly on a cash basis, there are 3 types of potential violations you should aim to avoid: **good faith violations**, **freeriding**, and **cash liquidations**.

## Good faith violation

**What is it?** A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as ""settled funds.""

Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a ""good faith violation"" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations:

**Good faith violation example, Marty:**

* Cash available to trade = $0.00
* On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds
* On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.

**Good faith violation example, Trudy:**

* Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled
* On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock
* On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500

At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However:

* Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock
* On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation
* This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock

**Consequences:** If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

## Freeriding violation

**What is it?** While the term ""freeriding"" may sound like a pleasant experience, it's anything but. A freeriding violation occurs when you buy securities and then pay for that purchase by using the proceeds from a sale of the same securities. This practice violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board concerning broker-dealer credit to customers. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur freeriding violations.

**Freeriding example, Marty:**

* Marty has $0 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* No payment is received from Marty by Wednesday's settlement date
* On Thursday, Marty sells ABC stock for $10,500 to cover the cost of his purchase

A freeriding violation occurs because Marty did not pay for the stock in full prior to selling it.

**Freeriding example, Trudy:**

* Trudy has $5,000 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, she buys $10,000 of ABC stock with the intention of sending a $5,000 payment before Wednesday through an electronic funds transfer
* On Tuesday, ABC stock rises dramatically in value due to rumors of a takeover
* Later in the day on Tuesday, Trudy sells ABC stock for $15,000 and decides it is no longer necessary to send the $5,000 payment

A freeriding violation has occurs because the $10,000 purchase of ABC stock was paid for, in part, with proceeds from the sale of ABC stock.

**Consequences:** If you incur 1 freeriding violation in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

As these examples illustrate, it's easy to encounter problems if you are an active trader and don't fully understand cash account trading rules. It is important to maintain sufficient settled funds to pay for purchases in full by settlement date to help you avoid cash account restrictions.

## Cash liquidation violation

**What is it?** A cash liquidation violation occurs when you buy securities and cover the cost of that purchase by selling other fully paid securities after the purchase date. This is considered a violation because brokerage industry rules require you to have sufficient settled cash in your account to cover purchases on settlement date. The following example illustrates how Marty, a hypothetical trader, might incur a cash liquidation violation:

**Cash liquidation violation example, Marty:**

* Cash available to trade = $0.00
* On Monday, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* On Tuesday, he sells $12,500 of XYZ stock to raise cash to pay for the ABC trade that will settle on Wednesday

A cash liquidation violation will occur. Why? Because when the ABC purchase settles on Wednesday, Marty's cash account will not have sufficient settled cash to pay for the purchase because the sale of the XYZ stock will not settle until Thursday.

**Consequences:** If you incur 3 cash liquidation violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

A breakdown of how the short squeeze started and what’s going on with brokerages.,1708,l85fnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l85fnq/a_breakdown_of_how_the_short_squeeze_started_and/,412,1611986105.0,"GameStop short float is currently around 250%. 

For a second, let’s just imagine there are only 100 shares total of GameStop.

This means that person A owns 100 shares. Person B is a short seller and borrows them, sells them to person C who buys them. At this point the stock is 100% short.

Person C then lends those shares to Person D who is a short seller who then sells them to person E who buys them.  The stock is now 200% short. 

Person E lends 50 of them to person F who is a short seller who sells them to person G who buys 50. The stock is now 250% short

So now person A, C, and E all own the same 100. The brokerage sights are limiting buying because they are attempting to unwind that! If everybody right now demanded their shares. The brokerage sites should be on the hook for $34.5 Bil worth of stock that doesn’t exist.

That’s fucked up but here’s where it gets crazy. 

There were never any controls on monitoring if somebody’s shares had been sold short twice. 

When a short seller sells shares. They are immediately paid. So cash is in their accounts. 
When a person buys shares they pay money out and theoretically own shares. But because the short selling wasn’t tracked brokers do not possess the shares they were putting into the market. If everyone were to request their shares they would default on their obligations and fold. Meaning they only have 100 shares and person A, C, and E all have a claim to those shares. Meaning the buyers are left fighting over who has shares. And the short sellers are left holding the cash they collected. 

It gets super messy. 

If Robinhood were to default. Short sellers win. Then most likely the fed has to come in and save the buyers spending tax dollars. That’s why the fed is getting involved.

By limiting shares and removing the ability to continue to short, they are trying to unwind this mess without it causing a panick.

That is why the broader market is down. 

Not because of shorts covering... but because of the potential for brokerages to collapse. 

I’m guessing Robinhood, TD, IB, and E-Trade are on the hook for a vast majority of the shares that don’t actually exist but multiple people own.

Imagine if person A says he doesn’t want to lend his shares.  The broker and clearing house has to figure out how to balance person B-G sourcing shares from somewhere else.

If the brokerages don’t go under. Short sellers, the hedge funds, are on the hook. 

If they do go under... economic recession. 

Retail investors once again left holding the bag.

Institutions don’t use these little guys. They use IB to trade and then they have the physical shares transferred into accounts at 5/3rd. If IB were to go under their fund would be fine. But most brokerage accounts are only insured up to up to $250k.

This is a failure of the system as a whole. This is a problem created by the top .001% and they are trying to call it a Reddit rebellion. Fuck that. 

This is totally a short selling fault. I think the outcome of this is that short selling gets banned.

Edit: Changed we to they, our to their. I’m not a hedge fund manager I’m a retail retard like the rest of you who just wanted to spread some information.

However, 4 of those 5, the class  lead is a Plaintiff that didn't own shares of the affected stocks and  were people who were forbidden from buying them.  They essentially  boiled down to a person searching for a stock, not being able to find  it, and claiming damages from that.  Only one of the 5 - the one filed  in the 10th Circuit, District of Colorado - is led by a Plaintiff who  was actually IN these equities, sold some shares after the restriction  occurred, and has actual tangible damages as a result of the trading  platforms.  As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one  that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the  major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this  particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get  rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first.  It's also  the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action.

I've  been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for  all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result  of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

The  firm representing the action in the 10th Circuit is the Hannon Law  Firm, and the case is being speared by founder Kevin Hannon.

This groundswell of retards LIKING THE STOCK is the best marketing campaign EVER. WSB now has 6M users. Let’s say half of them buy video games, that is 3M people who will now exclusively buy from GameStop.

E-Commerce companies trade at high tech multiples, as opposed to seedy mall location video game store multiples. The biggest cost to e-commerce is marketing. It is all about thin margins, and more sales, driven by digital marketing campaigns. Maybe the entire physical mall footprint of GameStop is worthless, but people start downloading their call of duty through GameStop, or they partner with activision or EA. The brand name and popularism now has a huge intangible value. 

This is the thing I keep thinking about — if something like DOGCOYN, a literal joke, created as a joke, can have a $10B market cap from retail buying, why can’t a company like GME that trades like PEOPLE LOVE IT have a market cap of $50B if the masses decide and the momentum institutions follow?

""ONE OF THE FIRM'S PRIMARY SELLING POINTS WAS THAT IT DID NOT CHARGE ITS CUSTOMERS TRADING COMMISSIONS. IN REALITY, HOWEVER, ""COMMISSION FREE"" TRADING AT THE FIRM CAME WITH A CATCH: THE FIRM'S CUSTOMERS RECEIVED INFERIOR EXECUTION PRICES COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE FIRM'S COMPETITIORS. FOR LARGER VALUE ORDERS,THIS PRICE DIFFERENCE AT THE FIRM EXCEEDED THE COMMISSION ITS COMPETITORS WOULD HAVE CHARGED. THESE INFERIOR PRICES WERE CAUSED IN LARGE PART BY THE UNUSUALLY HIGH AMOUNTS THE FIRM CHARGED PRINCIPAL TRADING FIRMS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER ORDER FLOW. THESE PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS ""PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW."" CERTAIN OF THE FIRM'S RETAIL COMMUNICATIONS OMITTED ITS RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW. SINCE THE FIRM'S LAUNCH, PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW HAS BEEN THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE. THE FIRM'S CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS AND TRADE CONFIRMATIONS STATED IT ""MAY"" RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW, HOWEVER, IN FAQS ON THE FIRM'S WEBSITE DESCRIBING HOW IT MADE MONEY, AND IN CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS ADDRESSING THE SAME ISSUE, IT OMITTED PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW WHEN IT DESCRIBED ITS REVENUE SOURCES BECAUSE IT BELIEVED THAT PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW MIGHT BE VIEWED AS CONTROVERSIAL BY CUSTOMERS. THE FIRM ALSO INSTRUCTED ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES NOT TO MENTION PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW IN RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SOURCES OF REVENUE.""

**TLDR:** Robinhood fills your orders at shittier prices, that results in additional costs that exceed the cost of commission you would pay at competing firms. Robinhood also lied and was purposefully deceptive about selling YOUR ORDER INFO to principal trading firms (CITADEL).

Brokerages losing their shit and breaking law in broad daylight, everyone exposing crooked hedge fund managers, finding apparent connections between the White House and Citadel, TEACHING people about the stock market and its fundamentals (holy fuck guys, just realise how many people learned what short squeeze is this week)!

Doesn't matter if you are the OG or just hopped in, if it's $10 mln or your $20 life savings. You will be remembered, and if I ever meet someone in real life who'll tell me they fought against the criminals in suits, I'll gladly buy you the cheapest piss beer and drink with you at the dumpsters behind Wendy's. Some people found purpose because of you, and this is no fucking joke. You united more people than you think - this is a financial revolution, first one in the era of digitalisation.

I'm fucking proud of all of you, and happy for every cent you'll take from these greedy bastards. You should all be proud of yourselves.

This is far from over, so remember - **hold the fucking line.**

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

**Position: I have around 14k shares across 2 brokers.**

[I lost shares to CCs if you compare to old SS. I also bought more at a much higher price.](https://preview.redd.it/q5uwj3sp5he61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0889a25d38f6792fe185690f8f3fbb5289143b)

There are forces at play here that didn't exist during the VW squeeze. The gamma squeezes and sheer idiocy of option buying by you all has created a perfect storm which is what is created all the trading restrictions. There were going to be gamma squeezes every week until the short squeeze was triggered and no institution has the capital to handle weekly gamma squeezes. I think the restrictions has stopped the infinite gamma squeezes which is probably good for the market because it may have created a collapse and we could never buy chicken tenders again.

So back to timing the MOASS and when to sell.  
1. 💎👐  
2. I firmly believe you can't time it anymore. The institutions are much more advanced now and the short ladder attacks which we saw multiple times this week and in 2020 creates artificial drops that make it look the bottom is falling out of the squeeze. (i.e., stop loss is bad)  
3. They are obviously willing to lose ridiculous amounts of money borrowing shares because they don't want to ""lose"" to a bunch of internet 🐒.   
4. This isn't Porsche owning all the shares. Whatever they say, none of us really know what any of us are going to do. We certainly can't coordinate buying or selling because we would have all bought with DFV. So we may see spikes from a hedge fund covering after short ladder attacks or PM/AH trading. We won't know if any of these spikes are the MOASS.  
5. They made this a war of us vs them. This is personal now for a lot of us and we are willing to hold much longer than any rational person would. Some people will probably hold through the squeeze and fall and witness the rebirth of GME by Ryan Cohen and see the shares go back to $100-$300 on its own. **The original thesis**.  
6. Watch the volume. The short ladder attacks occurred during low volume. Volume will sky rocket during the MOASS and even during the ride back down volume will be high. This is black Friday when the doors open and boomer Karens are climbing on top of each other to buy a tickle me Elmo.  
7. Gamestop step in during the squeeze and announce they are going to bail out the shorters.  
8. They are taking advantage of ladder attacks and trading halts.  
9. Without the gamma pressure from options, we may see the stock price drop significantly after they cover from this past week.  
10. We don't know the price point for the shorters anymore. There could be a significant amount of shorters with price points above $100.  
11. **HOLY SHIT THE PUTS!!!! I just totaled the puts for next week. \~149,000 puts from $0.50 to $100. 8,359 puts from $100 to $320. These are all OTM.** There are a lot of puts that are OTM every week in February.

**My Plan**: I'm exercising all my options (vary between $15-$30 strikes) now because I'm worried about lack of buyers/liquidity and stability of the trading platforms for retail during a MOASS. I'm going to adjust when I sell based on what is going on because there has been too much fuckery. I imagine I will sell a large percentage of my stocks between $1000 and $2000, but we could just as easily see a sudden spike from $900 to $2000 in a 5 minute window and then I probably won't sell till over $5000. If we slowly increase over days and weeks (10%-50%) my tolerance to hold will increase and my sell points will adjust.

GME Shorts Will Try to Buy From Longs Over Weekend - Discuss,1030,l8m1oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8m1oj/gme_shorts_will_try_to_buy_from_longs_over/,410,1612043294.0,"Good morning retards. 

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

> If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hoovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* ~~Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday.~~ Ok looks like the gamma squeeze may have occurred [already](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/). Thanks to /u/BlueEstee for that DD - they definitely have more wrinkles on their lobes than me!
*~~All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.~~
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

tl;dr shorts current situation

> They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

Holder |Common Shares Held (Millions) |% Of CSO |Gain ($ Billions) |Position Date Update
---|---|----|----|----|----
FMR (Fidelity Investments) |9.5 |13.7% |$3.0 |Sep-30-2020
Ryan Cohen |9.0 |12.9 |2.9 |Jan-10-2021
BlackRock |8.6 |12.3 |2.7 |Sep-30-2020
Vanguard Group |5.3 |7.6 |1.7 |Sep-30-2020
Susquehanna International Group |4.4 |6.3 |1.4 |Sep-30-2020
Dimensional Fund Advisors |3.9 |5.7 |1.3 |Sep-30-2020
Senvest Management |3.6 |5.2 |1.2 |Oct-07-2020
Donald A. Foss |3.5 |5.0 |1.1 |Feb-28-2020
MUST Asset Management (SOLD STAKE!) |3.3 |4.7 |1.1 |Mar-18-2020

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

This is not investment advice. Don't take investment advice from the internet.

Positions: 1000 shares bought @ 16

APES TOGETHER STRONG.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awards but please save your $ for gme shares. 

EDIT2: For those of you doubting the willingness of Longs to sell NOW to avoid more volatility, consider that a large gme shareholder - MUST - sold off their entire stake this [week](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28).

We perceive this company not as a next Blockbuster, but as a next Netflix that can adapt to changing circumstances. GME's online sales are growing each and every quarter in a rapid pace.

"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:",52474,l8lxuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lxuy/if_your_friends_and_family_are_wondering_why/,3304,1612042935.0,"There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",2021-01-30 23:42:15

Listen you retards. I will explain the logic of why GME needs AMC and AMC needs GME.

GME feels like a late ship for many. GME is not attractive to many people out there at this levels, just the commited ones. AMC is the second most shorted stock here with big hedge funds on the other side. Chartwise, they moved the same.


For GME to rocket, it needs AMC hype. People will want to get in at 15$/share now that the company is not bankrupt anymore and feels like a realistic fair valued company which was kept to the ground with shorts.


GME needs to hold it's own a bit until AMC loads up on people. 

GME is WSB short squeeze.
AMC is the rest of dumb retail short squeeze.

They both need the fomo and hype of each other to pull this through.

AMC might have even more support if you think about Hollywood and stuff like that and that it might get boomers interested in saving their memories from AMC.


TLDR:.  AMC NEEDS GME, GME NEEDS AMC.

BB, NOK are not short squeezes . End of story


Edit: if AMC was a diversion, they would have not limited the share at 1 as well. They are both fucking the shorts now that's why they limited both of them.


Edit: DONT FUCKING PULL OUT OF GME FOR AMC, WE NEED TO GET AMC GOING TO GET GME GOING, THATS WHAT I SAY



AMC

44.3m shares shorted last time was disclosed.

101m float

37% tutes ownership

That leaves around 60m float on market

44 out of 60 is over 70% short.

If they doubled down last week, we will see big moves coming

Only scary thing I realized from this thread is that these margin calls on the shorters and banks could go systemic 🤷‍♂️

Any boomers here who have historical perspective on a short squeeze, other than the VW one? I mean VW was only like 20% of the float if I've done my DD correctly. In fact I don't think there has ever been a stock shorted more than 100% of the float... I guess no one really knows what is going to happen here.",2021-01-30 23:39:42
A friendly reminder to all that Short Sellers are NOT the problem.,268,l8lvu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lvu8/a_friendly_reminder_to_all_that_short_sellers_are/,74,1612042753.0,"**TL;DR:** Fuck Melvin. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

It's very easy to get polarized and split groups down the middle, into ""us vs them."" While I agree that we stand united against abusive practices in the market, I don't think a majority of the people here have a proper appreciation of it.

**Short sellers are not the problem here.**
Short sellers are a necessary part of our markets, part of a ""healthy ecosystem"", if you will.
- Short sellers helped expose the housing credit fiasco banks were running that led to the 2008 crash, and if they hadn't, it could have ended up much worse. 
- Short sellers helped expose Valeant, a pharmaceutical company that was hiking the prices of live-saving drugs, because they knew people had no choice but to buy those drugs. 

In 2003, a statement was written to the SEC by James Chanos that further elaborates:

*""Many of the major corporate frauds and bankruptcies of the past quarter century were first exposed by short sellers doing fundamental research: Enron, Tyco, Sunbeam, Boston Chicken, Baldwin United, MicroStrategies, Conseco, ZZZZBest and Crazy Eddie are but a few examples of this phenomenon.""*
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/hedgefunds/hedge-chanos.htm#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20major%20corporate,few%20examples%20of%20this%20phenomenon.

We need short sellers.

💎✋💎✋💎✋
**What we DON'T need are groups that artificially short a stock into oblivion through uncovered (naked) trading.**
💎✋💎✋💎✋

That's what these hedge funds, and others, were doing. They wrote contracts agreeing to buy/sell a ton of shares at a certain price at a certain date... except they don't actually *have* the cash to be doing this with. What they were hoping to happen was keep the price down to ensure that the contracts would be profitable without ever needing to actually own the shares or have the cash to begin with.

And if you don't care about the cost of buying shares... then what's stopping you from just writing as many contracts as you want? Free money, right?

Well, they got caught with their pants down. Short interest on GME skyrocketed to 140%, and people sniffed something fishy reeeeaaal quick. Now, these firms are getting screwed because they'll be contractually obligated to buy the shares at whatever price we can sell them for.

In my mind, there's a powerful moral in this story for everyone here, especially newbies: **NEVER. SELL. NAKED. OPTIONS.** This should be *Trading Safety 101*.

Kids, if you want to sell a call option and collect that juicy premium money, you better own 100 shares of that company for when the piper comes calling. Likewise, if you want to sell a put option, you had better have enough cash to *actually buy* 100 of those shares at whatever price you picked.

Most brokers will enforce this on individuals, **but these firms and market makers are getting a pass, and I think it's time for that to end.** There wouldn't be any need for bailouts if people quit doing stupid shit, and if the executives responsible were actually held accountable (unlike 2008.)

Sincerely, some random Theta that just wants this whole thing to be over so I can get back to selling *covered* calls on my shares of BB, AMC, and so on, without waking up to find out they all jumped 1700% in one night. Sheesh.

GameStop Update 4: Weekend Recap,393,l8lvr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lvr8/gamestop_update_4_weekend_recap/,94,1612042744.0,"For those who missed it... Here is what happened this week.

1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.
2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.
3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.
4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.
5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.
6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share
7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).
8. Wednesday morning: ""We Like The Stock"". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350
9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla
10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.
11. A Battle Cry is let out ""We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""
12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m
13. Here is where things get dark...
14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.
15. According to Justin Kan ""Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME""
16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.
17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.
18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.
19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share
20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.
21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company
22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.

[GME] Why I feel less optimistic after Friday,0,l8lrsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lrsd/gme_why_i_feel_less_optimistic_after_friday/,213,1612042362.0,"Please don't lynch me. No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause. I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.

(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.

(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.

(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).

(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.

(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.

(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.

(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.

I thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.

(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.

(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.

(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.

(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.

(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.

Don't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.

I'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.

Edit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason. Thanks for all the thoughtful comments and insults. I also got added to the controversial club since apparently this thread was one of the most controversial in entire reddit 😂",2021-01-30 23:32:42

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.

Edit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING.",2021-01-30 23:17:07
"For those of you missing the ""good 'ol days"" on WSB...",22966,l8lgtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8lgtt/for_those_of_you_missing_the_good_ol_days_on_wsb/,2519,1612041299.0,"I've been around WSB now for about 5 years, mostly as a lurker.  I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing a ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their bank account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

So, we all remember the first attack on WSB last week, resulting in the sub going private for an hour so that the mods could get things under control.

If you recall, it was a pure numbers game. Insane amount of obvious bots with brand new accounts spamming tickers and 🚀 with no other actual content.

It was extremely easy to spot and report suspicious accounts. Mods took control quickly.

They have adapted. **Quickly**. The manipulation is currently much more sophisticated.

HFs underestimated individual investors and currently find themselves in a world of trouble. Do not make the same mistake they did. Consider the following:

&#x200B;

Every time you see a post that is ever so subtly guiding your attention away from GME, or has a general tone that the squeeze is basically over, or is giving good SI indicators about other potential squeezes etc, open their profile and do the following:

* **Posts**. Things to look for:

1. What were they posting about a few weeks ago. If its only topics unrelated to finance/investing➡️suspicious
2.  When was the last time they made a post before starting to post about GME/investing. If theres a time horizon greater than 2+ weeks between their usual activity and current GME squeeze posts➡️suspicious . 
3. *Telltale signs*: Account has a long history, posting about topics unrelated to finance and investing. Out of the blue, successive GME squeeze related posts. 

* **Comments**: 

1. Scroll through the comments to get a general sentiment and feeling of how “real” the account is. If they seem to be parroting a lot of GME squeeze related stances in great succession, followed once again by a time period cushion before their usual comments on other unrelated topics ➡️suspicious

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I will not repeat what everyone has heard and is already well aware of by now. We are in a historic event. The stakes are high. Huge sums are involved. Recognize the magnitude of the situation and approach every interaction with caution. Social media manipulation has been “solved” over the last decade, be constantly aware of that. Any information you read, always do your own research, on the topic and on the source itself.

And, of course GME 🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: In regards to the 2+ week time horizon between non finance topics and GME, that only applies to POSTS that are very confident in their advice. Obviously that doesn’t apply to comments.

The Table Where The Games Stop: A metaphor that is most certainly not financial advice.,147,l8l0ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8l0ck/the_table_where_the_games_stop_a_metaphor_that_is/,45,1612039686.0,"Story time, retards. Put on your reading glasses because your autistic ass doesn't get a TL:DR on this one, and you degenerates don't get any fucking emojis from me either.

*Ahem*

The Gay Bears had run a casino for a long time, and the house was rigged. The Retard Bulls who played knew this; but some were able to get lucky; so the other Retard Bulls mostly just looked the other way while the Gay Bears stole millions and millions of dollars from the Bulls' parents every ten years or so.

Until one day an especially autistic bull named Diamond Hooves learned how to count cards, and sought to get rich. Counting cards is not illegal, and Diamond Hooves secretly employed his method of card counting at many different tables in the casino, and he made a lot of money. But Diamond Hooves was very upset with what he saw while he won his money in the casino. Many other bulls were losing money to the Gay Bears, and it made Diamond Hooves very sad at first; and then very angry.

In his contempt for what the Gay Bears had done to his autistic bretheren, Diamond Hooves started to teach his secret method of card counting to every bull he knew. Once he was satisfied that he had educated enough of his bretheren, he led them to the most vulnerable table in the entire casino. The intention was clear, the Retard Bulls had all gathered of their own free will for a single purpose: To sit and play at the table where the Games Stop.

Diamond Hooves was very clear about his table selection, and he had indeed chosen the right table to bankrupt the Gay Bears. This was becoming clear to other Retard Bulls who had not yet decided that they wanted to join Diamond Hooves in counting cards at the table where the games stop. Unfortunately, the Gay Bears also knew that their casino could lose all of its money if too many Bulls counted cards at the table where the games stop; and they had a plan to defeat the bulls.

The Bears employed strongarm tactics to scare the bulls away from the table at first; but this only drew more bulls in. The Beears then stacked the decks against the bulls; but so many bulls had come to the table that it didn't matter. The bulls knew that they had to be willing to be bagholders. They had to be like Diamond Hooves.

The Gay Bears lured the bulls to other tables that would only serve to delay victory at the table where the Games Stop, and sucked them in to the losing tables with false comforts like movies and blackberries. Eventually some of these poor Bulls lost all of their money; but some were able to take the money they stashed away while watching movies and eating blackberries and take it back to the table where the Games Stop. If they had not done this; the battle may have been lost to the Gay Bears.

The Bears had one final set of tricks up their sleeves; and they disallowed any more Bulls to sit at the table where the Games Stop, and then limited new arrivals; and they started a program of disinformation. The Bears sought to villify the Retard Bulls playing at the table where the Games Stop, and they also sought to cover their losses by luring other bulls  into the casino so that they could lose money while eating blackberries and watching movies. It was never forgotten the the Bulls playing with Diamond Hooves at the table where the Games Stop were the good guys, or that the Gay Bears were the bad guys. Too many bulls had been bankrupted. Too many bull families had been kept in poverty for too many generations. The Game had to Stop.

To this day Diamond Hooves is still sitting at the table, calling his bretheren to count cards and bankrupt the casino. More and more bulls are joining, and the stakes keep getting higher and higher. Can you hear him in the distance?

""Remain at the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

""This does not work unless you are willing to hold an empty bag with Diamond Hooves!""

""Don't be distracted by movies or blackberries or anything else. Come play with Diamond Hooves!""

""Come to the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

Disclaimer: This is a metaphor; so it is DEFINITELY NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.

Effect of calls expiring ITM on Friday?,127,l8kbgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8kbgq/effect_of_calls_expiring_itm_on_friday/,142,1612037040.0,"With GME closing above 320 that allowed people to exercise their options to buy shares on any ITM contract. The calls with the highest open interest were 320 and almost everything between 100 and 200.

So what I am confused about is how does this benefit retail GME shareholders? I understand it decreases the amount of available shares which only helps load up the rocket to Alpha Centauri. However, what is stopping hedge funds from buying the contracts before close themselves and exercising, allowing them to start getting an advantage in owning more shares? Once they own the shares can't they just sell covered calls on them into next week and start making enough to make back a portion of losses? Is there even enough shares available to allow everyone to exercise?

EDIT: Thank you for the replies! I understand better now.

One last question:

Of course shorts will not willingly be covering at 500%+ losses and will try to drag this out as long as possible in hopes that us retards cave in. Ultimately, is the thing that will set this off the brokers who will start closing the shorts for the hedge funds at any price because hedge funds are unable to meet margin requirements and pay off their interests?

It’s unraveled so quickly, primarily in an arena hardly understood by many, that it’s not surprising the real human story would somehow get tangled within the misinformation of social and corporate media. The story arcs are so complex and the threads so wrapped up in a frayed society that it’s difficult to trace them back to the supposed players in any given corner. The entire world, since this devastating virus hit, is a testament to that. 

It would be a disservice to any reader to demarcate these players and their roles in this game because you likely already have your own understanding of who they are and what their objective may be. And if not, there’s a plethora of information strewn across the internet. This letter isn’t meant to sway or convince you of which corner of the ring to hang your hat on. It's my own personal synthesis trying to make sense of all the forces at work here, and it’s an entreaty for every reader to zoom out and take into account the blooming dynamic of an increasingly fractured society, and hopefully come to your own conclusions about how we all got here.

Now, more than ever, we have been using actions over words in an attempt to be heard. And this particular week, the drama played out on Wall Street between Hedge Funds and millions of individuals, and has become another dog-eared page in the history book of whatever the hell we’re going through right now. 

It should come as no surprise that millions of individuals emptied their linty pockets to put forward whatever money they had in order to back a company that had been shorted to oblivion during a time of crisis and quarantine. These are the same people who got tangled in the outdated bureaucratic unemployment system, or were forced to work because they were suddenly deemed essential. And yet they still struggled to find ways to pay rent, buy diapers, food, and worry about the ramifications of contracting the virus not because they feared for their life, but because the medical bills were more of a death sentence than the virus. 

Meanwhile, these short sellers maintained their long positions, which were essentially tantamount to rooting for the death knell of one of the few companies actually helping many stay sane during the quarantine; second, perhaps, only to any local animal shelter. Once lauded as virtuous for rooting out fraud within corrupt companies, it’s become clear that short sellers lost their path somewhere along the way, which isn’t a surprise, really, because the entire concept is that they’re betting on something to fail for their own benefit.

And here’s the thing: almost everyone on this WallStreetBets subreddit bought into this company because, you guessed it: they like the stock. When it was announced that Ryan Cohen (the man responsible for putting those Chewy boxes on doorsteps that were infinitely more valuable to pets than the toys in them) became a board member, enthusiasm shot through the roof. The so-called “tendies’ only became more juicy when WSBers realized the hedge funds held long shorts, due to the intrinsic value that many believed GameStop now possessed with a newly added visionary board member, and the faith that they could pivot from their old business model into a highly successful new one.

More and more individual retail investors read the due diligence written and posted by numerous Redditors over the course of several months last year, and also threw their money behind the company. And then when the hedge funds’ initial long contracts expired: they doubled down. And retail investors still believed in this stock, so they kept buying it. And then hedge funds doubled down again. Instead of cutting their losses, the hedge funds KEPT. DOUBLING. DOWN. Which brings us to the immediate present, and the entire maelstrom playing out before our very eyes. 

What initially started as a very enticing investment opportunity for retail investors quickly morphed into what was effectively a hedge fund throwing around billions of dollars to save themselves from the absurd and somehow still legal short contracts they placed in the first place. And in reflecting on everything that happened in 2008, it should come as no surprise that millions of individual retail investors would legally do whatever was in their power to actually hold these hedge funds accountable for their actions this time around. 

At this point, no one really knows what happens next, and there are numerous possibilities as to what the fallout may be. And to offer any speculation could be construed as potentially misleading, and harmful, at worst. These are the facts as one individual sees them after much due diligence and synthesis. What each and every one of you does with this information is your own responsibility. 

Power to the Players,

UK Alternatives to Trading212 without a middleman,186,l8k4es,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8k4es/uk_alternatives_to_trading212_without_a_middleman/,334,1612036275.0,"I’ve seen a lot of posts discussing how Fidelity and Vanguard are able to fulfil orders without a middleman so weren’t in the same boat as Robinhood and refused to restrict trading.

After Trading212 pulled the same shit Thursday, I was wondering if there are equivalent UK apps?

As I understand it:

* Freetrade - Uses a third party and restricted some US stocks (Edit: Freetrade state this was due to their currency exchange house refusing to change sterling for USD)

* Revolut - Uses a third party (Edit: Generally positive ITT but no ISA wrapper)

* Etoro - Uses a third party and restricted some US stocks

* HL - Terrible app, long order fulfilment time (Edit: Some people ITT say it’s great though and only experienced issues at open)

* Saxo? (Edit: Loads of people rate Saxo)

* Degiro - Seems popular on the continent but no ISA wrapper 


I probably can’t switch now because I prefer to trade in an ISA wrapper but looking for an alternative post April.

Obligatory: This is not financial advice and I’m not looking for advice either, just information.

"So, fellow tards, I want to help with the silver issue (Futures) and need some intel.",63,l8jx4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8jx4p/so_fellow_tards_i_want_to_help_with_the_silver/,119,1612035445.0,"I could convince some business partners with quite some buying power to hop on the silver train and hence need some information on potential future deals.

We're based in Europe and as far as I can tell, there are only american Silver futures available (CMEgroup). I don't have experience in trading futures.

So here are some open questions regarding this:

Can we as europeans trade CME silver futures and can we let them deliver to a warehouse in our Country? If yes, what about shipment costs?

reference: [https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver)

There it's mentioned that March is an active future month. What does that mean? Physical delivery can only take place in march?

Additionally, fellow europeans - any idea about upcoming taxes for the physical delivery? We have to pay VAT for buying silver here as far as I know.

So - do you think the physical delivery is even possible? Also to Europe?

let's do this!

e/ I'm already long slv/pslv and silver options. And with slv I mean a european a fully backed european version ""Xtrackers Physical Silver ETC""

e2/ why did I even ask in here! Does anybody even read the text? I know it requires an attention spawn of more than 20 seconds, but come on...

e3/ Some of you didn't fully comprehend, that it's all about getting silver physically. As far as I know, the Papermarket is 250 times bigger than the physical market. A Shortage in the physical market will potentially cause moon prices.  Just read the DDs on silver from the last days:

e4/ I don't want you degenerates to get out of your beloved GME stock. Hold as long as you want, my post here has nothing to do with GME. I'm just positioning myself for the next big thing and want to play it early.

Let's get one thing clear,17881,l8jwmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8jwmx/lets_get_one_thing_clear/,1947,1612035387.0,"I feel like we should clarify something. This subreddit has seen a surge of 5,5m people in these last days. That's a lot of people and thats great. But I think theres a few people that don't know a lot about the short squeeze and are here for a quick buck.

if you thought you could profit by the end of this week, this was not the case. The shorts at Wednesday gained an advantage. Imagine if we could stop the market when we had a red day. We would all be billionaires by now. That's what they did. 

I still think the squeeze is still in play though. This means, this will not be as quick and they expect new people to lose interest/panic sell so they can cover lower. It's all or nothing for them. They could pull more insane stuff by next week, you can count that as a possibility. 

That's why its important to understand the play here and not just jump on the hype wagon. You're doing more harm that way. Learn about short squeezes and educate yourself on what has happened till now. 

TLDR: I believe the squeeze is still on. But due to Thursday, it may have gone back a week or so. Due to a surge in people here, they may expected a squeeze to occur on friday. And I could imagine that hedge funds bet on new people losing interest. That's why its important to educate yourselves, To make your own opinion about the stock. 

Obviously this is just my opinion. Don't treat this as financial advice.",2021-01-30 21:36:27
