A True Autists DD on why r/wallstreetbets is now forever shit.,1,lj4mvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj4mvk/a_true_autists_dd_on_why_rwallstreetbets_is_now/,0,1613265403.0,"Ok autists. Listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking about r/wallstreetbets and the shit going on with Gamestop and its effects on the various communities. 

To add a quick interject of experience, I'm a one year trader who found wsb about three/four months ago, loved the loss porn, and got really taken for a ride with the whole GME experience.

I've been thinking about the different groups and how WSB was before and after. I only ever saw WSB as 'advice' until during and after GME. Again, wsb was a casino. It was for idiots to throw cash at a yolo and MAYBE. MAAAAAYYBEE. Make money. It was to see idiot kids and even more retarded adults throw a 1/50 lottery ticket. If you want 1/5 literally take the years to become an investor. It's hard. The adage 'if it was easy everyone would do it' remains true here.

Now I think people are starting to look at WSBs as real investing. Which if you're doing stop right now. The weed yolo is an example of scaling. GME took about 2-3 weeks for major media and the investing world to catch on. Weed took 2-3 days. The next one will be hours. People are watching r/wallstreetbets. And eyes will stay on for at least a year. Deep money will not take money off of sending a few bots to pick out the top mentioned, or even just a list of all, stock tickers for a least a decade. WSB is over. The hedgefunds learned their lesson. And if they somehow are the assininely stupid give them 2-3 more. You need to find something new if you want what wsbs gave you. Something they have not thought of, are not looking at, or have not thought to look for. Nothing less will have their eyes on it.

That being said if this doesnt get a lot of upvotes and anyone has an ideas of what that might be please let me know I want to see idiots lose money where it's not sad af.",2021-02-14 03:16:43

RH sent me a BS email back about the support ticket I sent them a while ago,5,lj3st0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj3st0/rh_sent_me_a_bs_email_back_about_the_support/,25,1613262857.0,"Thanks for getting in touch with us‚ÄîI definitely want to address your concerns. 

 
We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks from January 28 to February 4 were frustrating, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms. 

 
To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [a letter to our customers.](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/a-letter-to-our-robinhood-community) Here‚Äôs a summary of the letter:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [volatility](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/the-stock-market-has-been-super-volatile-how-can-i-make-sense-of-it/) in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds.**

We stand with everyday investors participating in the market and we‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system.

 
I know you may still have questions, so feel free to reply to this email. I‚Äôm here to help however I can.

There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also ample signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.

That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like ""weed is dead"" and ""I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz.""

For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.

Can I vent 

I recently learned I violated a rule here that I blew money I could afford to Loose!

I did all last year.

I was married for 10 years. Got into stock investing in 2018.  Business owner in California since 2016. 

Business was doing good 180k latest gross month and started investing with robinhood only 1k then. 

2016 I rented a house for 4k 6 bedroom in Los Angeles.

Once separated I became homeless while my wife took my 5 kids to nyc in May 2019. I was sending her roughly 3k and assuredly she was fucking a boyfriend. 

She returned and I got her and my kids a house and moved out of air bnb to stay in the house with my gf and now my soon to be x is gay. So I‚Äôm staying there with her, her gf, me and my gf. This shit was dumb as hell. 

I run a ac business that I destroyed during my separation. 2 mil in sales for 3 years that now I‚Äôm lucky if I do 200k a year now. 

2019 when I thought trading wasn‚Äôt for me because I had already lost 5k in options between Webull and rh I blew 10k in the strip club and missed a very bullish market.

May 2020 after getting kicked out the house I got with my x so that her gf could pay the bills I was homeless again staying in hotels and air bnb. I ran ads for my business for ac repair and hustled up 15k and used 10k for rh and Webull again.

I decided to renter the market and off I went with options 

Aapl tsla Ford American Airlines Macy‚Äôs etc 

Made money lost money 

Total up my losses for 2020 is 20k.

I knew I would be ok because I had my dad insurance money because he past to back me up for getting me a place. I received secured a place and stay in Hollywood ca 

Have my kids 2 weeks out month and required to pay 2500 monthly child support 

Busienss sucks these days I used business profits to pay bills and of course gamble.

I‚Äôm in 2021 been getting eviction notices since December but finally learned that in ca since September you only required to pay 25% of rent until July 2021 and the debt is interest free to pay back to landlord. 

I paid rent in full 2300 since September until December which is almost 10k and the requirement is 2500 roughly. I‚Äôm learning that I‚Äôm paid up quite well.

I‚Äôve bitten the bullet that my company is down and taken a sales job for peddling hvac systems. 

I‚Äôm pretty good at what I do. 

I called tlry week before it rose and people said I was wrong. Check post for me I was fb aapl and tsla fan boy before it popped. 

I‚Äôm going to beat this system and yolo the fuck out of my commission checks. 

I will keep this community updated with full transparency as I promise to be dropping 2k in options as often as possible. 

I‚Äôm expecting to make with this job 10-20k a month because of my experience and commission. 

2020 I paid college Tuition to learn these markets.

I like stocks and I lost money on my own accord.

I shared this for those that like long fucking life stories and to remind you to look into new regulations for rent and mortgage payments.

Time to leverage this debt and yolo. 

Positions now is ddd and Kroger‚Äôs 

I‚Äôve got a whole list!!!!",2021-02-14 07:57:00
Puts on everything,1,lja24p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lja24p/puts_on_everything/,33,1613281481.0,"A bit of a rant here. While I hate to pile on to the negative sentiment floating around here, and at the risk of sounding like a üåàüêª, PUTS. ON. EVERYTHING. Let‚Äôs look at the facts

No trading on Monday so on Tuesday the volume is going to go to shit like every shorty week. Tuesday is also going to have a üçÜ load of bad earnings. Most notably the in the housing sector (no supply) , retail, and Vegas stocks (the recovery is not ramping up as fast as everyone anticipated). But Tuesday is going to look like a jpow brand printer compared to Wednesday. 

Wednesday‚Äôs earnings bring us pharma and oil. Two sectors that combined may actually make for a neutral day if the market can look past them. But if they don‚Äôt it will be because they realize oil prices are going to top soon because the jabiden knows the saudis better than the last admin and they WILL increase supply if prices get too out of hand. And pharma earnings will definitely beat but not by enough to give the people confidence enough that the recovery is going smoothly. And that brings to the worst day of the week. The crescendo to the madness. Thursday.

This is not news but our fearless leaders are putting all eyes on us Thursday. It‚Äôs been an honor serving with you autists. I‚Äôll remember our time fondly. For those who are extra retarded, Citadel‚Äôs Ken Griffin, Robinhood‚Äôs Vlad Tenev, Melvin Capital Management chief Gabriel‚ÄØPlotkin, Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman, and Keith Gill, DFV himself, the artist formerly known as roaring kitty. A man I would be proud to call my wife‚Äôs boyfriend are all scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, and they are going to throw our asses right under the bus! Here‚Äôs a quote from the vicious snake Maxine waters that called our hero to congress. 

‚ÄúAddressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are fair, orderly, and efficient,‚Äù

You read that correctly smooth brains. We are helpless creatures that need protecting and they will trot out DFV to try and prove it. Personally I think DFV is a smart guy and I encourage everyone to watch his initial game stop thesis on the roaring kitty YouTube page. You don‚Äôt even have to read. But clearly congress thinks he is a pump and dump master that harnessed the power of the most chaotic sub on the internet. Don‚Äôt be surprised when Melvin capital is not made out to be the bad guy in this scenario. But once the rage subsided and you take a closer look they definitely want to regulate us. Can you blame them? We‚Äôre unruly degenerates that run up companies just for memes and loss porn.  That cannot and will not stand. That means goodbye commission free trading. Stricter options rules or doing away with them on order flow platforms all together. Maybe they go a little crazy and put higher taxes on short term capital. Either way this the apocalypse, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the least bit over exaggerating. The big guys know that won‚Äôt sit well with us and they will start turning cash gang in seconds. The negative reaction will compound into more negative reaction, üåàüêª on here will buy tons of puts further extending the negative sentiment until we spiral down to hell. The rivers will turn to blood. Fire will rain down from the sky. A plague of locusts cover the lands. Jabiden will accidentally nuke China. And Warner brothers will do a remake of nothin but trouble. The sell off will keep going till the end of AH and leave everyone wondering what could possibly happen tomorrow. 

Friday is not news just more selling. With a side of selling. And a selling chaser. We will go back to doing SPY weeklys rebuild this world.

Every penny stock with a BS DD talking about how this is a ""short play"" or we are going to eviscerate the short investors and moon.

Even a retard like me know how fucking stupid the reason is. Let's see, you buy a stock, other people start buying, the interest on the short position goes up, the short investor needs to cover his position, and he is desperate to pay any price because he is so heavily reverse-invested in the stock. That's the gist of a short squeeze retards.

If you are buying a no-name stock, you don't know the ratio of short against the outstanding stock and a ton of other factors you don't have an idea how to google, you don't get to squeeze the short investor. The short investor will just see a temporary bump and that's all. DFV is a professional finance guy with a CFA and with the appropriate of autism to make him successful, you are investing based on the word ""short squeeze"" and just downloaded Robinhood last week and the only dime you made from that when someone clicked on the referral link you posted on facebook.

Your main goal is to find a heavily shorted stock first and somehow keep raising its price. But that requires quite some effort, charisma and retard luck to do that.

"GameStop, the Endgame of Wallstreet: their whole playbook explained and why naked shorts won‚Äôt show up in next short interest .",16,ljm35u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljm35u/gamestop_the_endgame_of_wallstreet_their_whole/,19,1613327390.0,"THEORY:
1) Robinhood and others block the buying . Then limit the buying to a couple of shares .
2) hedge funds 1 combine forces together and sell naked GME stock with delivery in 2days (T2) 
3) because retail is limited to buy a couple of shares , the shares sold are +90% bought by a friendly hedge fund 2. 
4) hedge fund 2 sells again those shares at a lower price to hedge fund 1 , hedge fund 1 delivers the naked short shares to the clearinghouse before T2 ends. = no new short interest is recorded or will be added to the 2 weekly short interest 
5) due that the naked short shares are back delivered before T2, no high borrowing interest needs to be paid . And this game does cost them nothing . 

CONDITIONS: 
This game above works only perfect if the naked short shares sold do NOT LAND IN TO OTHER HANDS , then those of the hedge funds gang.  Otherwise they can not be given sold back to hedge fund 1 to give back before T2. 
HOW: 
1. Block and after limit retail investors from buying more shares as those will be lost in this closed circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è between hedge funds.  The deal has to be done across all brokerages . This is mass scale manipulation. 
2. Block retail investors from shorting shares as that would provide a buying spree if prices go up again. 

ZERO COST: 
The above closed circle of naked short selling to other hedge funds is a zero cost (except the the little shares lost to retail buyers on the min purchase price ) no high borrowing interest to be paid , so in theory they could do this as long as retail is limited to buy new shares AND stimulated to sell their shares . 

PARALLEL CHAIN: 
Although the above game does cost them nothing , their need to be a gain of getting cheap shares out of the pockets of the retail holders .
HOW: step guide : 
1. Lower the margin value of GME stock so you can not buy other things by just holding on your GME stock. You need to sell them to create cash that can be used to buy other things THEY place in your mind as a good buy. 
And this part is the following :
1. DISTRACTION: Divide the retail group power munition: create hype in other things as Silver , Nokia , etc so the retail Wallstreetbeds gang shoots their arrows on other targets . Less arrows left = less munition for the real battle GME. 
2. Create a link with the distraction group and the main target GME. So they all belong to the same investment ideas.  Even if they have nothing to do with each other . People will later link them in their mind . Nesasary for the next steps. 
3. Pull retail investors back in to the Original Gamestonk = TESLA:
    - Interview with Musk in Clubhouse who invites Vladimir Tenev CEO of Robinhood.

Hedge fund 2 that sold naked has 2 days to clear their naked shorts before they will be marked as short interest . They follow the above playbook. 

All above is IMO of what I have seen. It is not an investment advice. But it could give your mind some peace and Birdseye view on all what is happening around you now, so you make calculated decisions on your investment and can leave emotions out of it.

As you can see, this all is so interesting games played by 2 different camps that they will make a movie out of it.

Copyrighted all info above . 


Possible THEORY:
1) Robinhood and others block the buying by retail investors  . After limit the buying to a couple of shares .
2) hedge funds combine forces together and hedge fund 1 sell naked GME stock with delivery in 2days (T2) 
3) because retail is limited to buy a couple of shares , the shares sold are +90% bought by a friendly hedge fund 2. 
4) hedge fund 2 sells again those shares at a lower price on the market and hedge fund 1 buys most of them (retails are limited in buying ) .
Hedge fund 1 delivers the naked short shares to the clearinghouse before T2 ends. = no new short interest is recorded or will be added to the 2 weekly short interest .
5) due that the naked short shares are back delivered before T2, no high borrowing interest needs to be paid . And this game does cost them nothing . 

CONDITIONS: 
This game above works only perfect if the naked short shares sold do most NOT LAND IN TO OTHER HANDS , then those of the hedge funds gang.  Otherwise they can not be sold back to hedge fund 1 via the market to give back to the clearinghouse before T2. 

HOW: 
1. Block buying and later limit retail investors from buying more shares as those will be lost in this closed circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è between hedge funds.  The deal has to be done across all brokerages . (This is mass scale manipulation IMO)
2. Block retail investors from shorting shares as that would provide a buying spree if prices go up again. 

ZERO COST: 
The above closed circle of naked short selling to other hedge funds via the market as no other retail buyers allowed is a zero cost (except the little shares lost to retail buyers on the min purchase orders ) no high borrowing interest to be paid , so in theory they could do this as long as retail is limited to buy new shares AND stimulated to sell their shares via media attacks.

PARALLEL CHAIN: 
Although the above game does cost them nothing , their need to be a gain of getting cheap shares out of the pockets of the retail holders .

HOW: step guide : 
1. Lower the margin value of GME stock so you can not buy other things by just holding on your GME stock. You need to sell them to create cash that can be used to buy other things THEY place in your mind as a good buy. 
And this part is the following :
1. DISTRACTION: Divide the retail group power munition: create hype in other things as Silver , Nokia , etc so the retail Wallstreetbeds gang shoots their arrows on other targets . Less arrows left = less munition for the real battle GME. 
2. Create a link with the distraction group and the main target GME. So they all belong to the same investment ideas.  Even if they have nothing to do with each other . People will later link them in their mind . Nesasary for the next steps. 
3. Pull retail investors back in to the Original Gamestonk = TESLA:
    - Interview with Musk in Clubhouse who invites Vladimir Tenev CEO of Robinhood.
    - Price target upgrade for TSLA of 120% by Piper Sandler why sundenly comes with this upgrade a week after an earnings miss when all other analyst came out a week before with no changes in their PT. 
    - and it worked, the same morning TSLA started to go up, GME went down . And the same for the next day . 
4. Media has to publish stories that the Reddit group investors are selling (a story to justify the price decline) and or moving to other targets as silver and Nokia . 
5. Let the DISTRACTION group fall, because before media has tagged /correlated/linked  the distraction group to the main target GME, the fall of these distraction group tricks your mind thinking that your main target GME will fail also .  A psychology mind trick. Although they are not the same, your mind will feel it as the same and makes you nervous that your investment GME is next to fail. With as goal you can not hold the stress and give up your shares. 

REMOVE RETAIL investors arms:

One day before the snapshot , hedge fund 2 sells naked new shares on the market and hedge fund 1 tries to buy them. Delivers them back to the clearinghouse and they will publish it as a lower outstanding short interest .  Hedge fund 2 that sold naked has 2 days to clear their naked shorts before they will be marked as short interest . They follow the above playbook. 

THE KNOCKOUT PUNCH :
Divide the moderators of the WSB group: same playbook used in war,  ‚Äúplay the generals out against each other .  If the infantry loses trust in their generals, the lines will start to crack down and the enemy will break true it . 


All above is IMO of what I notice . It is not an investment advice. But it could give your mind some Birdseye view on all what is happening around you now, so you make calculated decisions on your investment and can leave emotions out of it.

Can you ""to the moon, 5000 is not a meme, diamond hands"" etc... People please give a straight non meme answer And properly refute the doom and gloom regarding GME that has taken over here.

I admit I joined this place after hearing about the gme rocket in the news and yes I went in due to FOMO and yes I spent money I couldn't afford to lose and yes I have very limited understanding of the stock market and yep I went in when it was at 310 or 320‚Ç¨.

Can anyone please give some clarification. Have the hedgefunds cleared their short positions? Is it true that if we wait long enough we in basically get to set the price? hen will this happen?

Why I am GME,228,ljkpgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljkpgj/why_i_am_gme/,87,1613320134.0,"GME is me. I am GME. This is a serious post. \*THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\*

I bought GME to make money. There is no way around it. No need to lie or fake it like most the people on here. I held to make a statement. I got in at $300 for 100 shares hoping it would go to the moon. I didn't sell at $375. $470. I held. And now, even at $50...I am holding. This is no longer about money. This is about Good VS Evil. The average man vs the 1%. This is the fight of a lifetime.

I didn't grow up rich. Every penny I made and invested I bled for. No excuses. So I write this message of hope. HOLD. HOLD THE LINE. I've seen so many post with no context. HOLD your positions because you think it's bullshit that Robinhood sold out. Melvin can manipulate the market. That the SEC continues to turn a blind eye to all that is happening. I don't even want to win back my money. I want to stick it to Melvin and every other hedge fund that rips people off. I survived 2008. I saw tons of 401ks turn into dust. And then the government bailed out the Big Banks and all the shady brokers that helped make this happen. They didn't pay for anything. They just got away with it and got even bolder.

To all the people who threw in their HARD EARNED MONEY, don't despair. KARMA happens to us all. The Hedgies will get what is coming to them. Stay strong. This is no longer about riding the rocket to the moon. Paper vs Diamond hands. This is working blue collar, working white collar vs the ELITE. The establishment. If you read this and I'm still alive, then I am still holding. I refuse to give in to them.

MURICA.

Twitter and Facebook have been actively filled with bots for years, or even ""farms"" of real humans doing the typing. It's been made very clear bad-faith actors are powerful enough to make you hate your neighbor and even impact elections. Reddit is no different.

Without even considering the above, growing 4x overnight is damaging enough by itself. The culture of the sub will always be heavily diluted with the wrong kind of chromosomes if no drastic actions are taken.

Generally, if you ran this type of sub and saw millions of Autist Andy's joining from the news, you would have decided to private the sub for its own good before it got out of hand. Did any mods advocate for this? Who was against it? Are they still here? This seems like an important topic to touch on I haven't seen mentioned really.

In my view, the only way to reverse all the drama and division from the original community would be to revert the sub back to its pre-media follower count and privatize afterwards. This should help quell the ""diamondhand ape together strong"" disease.

New retards should be consolidated on a special fleet of short buses to a new subreddit for a period of time before being allowed over. I lurked WSB for years, but did not participate in the community until recently. Now I see fringe WSB communities making r/all and conspiracies all around. A lot of top posts/comments on diff subreddits are about this subreddit being ""compromised"" - how do you change the cancer of that sentiment? Are those types of posts majorly upvoted by hype train bagholders, or do OGs feel this way? I know everyone wants zjz and a lot might not come back or change their mind due to his departure - but its been shown we have admins to blame for that, not mods. But **something should be done to repair the damage that the media has caused to the OG WSB contributors.

I wanted to consider myself financially illerate. I didn't know shit about accounting, how to do taxes or how to build wealth. I started trading because I thought I could make some side money. I am also a lazy MF and had a okay job that paid 17/hr. But I was pretty much depressed. 

Now I consider myself a well informed retarded gambler. The stock market has literally changed my life for the better, and has completely changed my outlook on money and how the system is there to teach people to work, not to be wealthy. 

My fellow autist, you a smarter then most people who don't know jackshit about how much money you can make on the markets. Most people just give there money to the banks or just do passive investing(I have no issues with this, but missing out on great opportunities is super retarded).

I worked at a bigger brokerage than Robinhood that uses Citadel for payment on order flow too. During the whole GameStop thing they didn‚Äôt shut down trading. As much as we like to jerk ourselves off in here, Robinhood doesn‚Äôt have the customers to influence the market to that degree. There were buyers all over retail and most likely institutional as well. This industry is highly regulated and Robinhood users are using a brokerage that started in what like 2011? They make it easy but they are also new and there are advantages to using an established broker and advantages to RH but also disadvantages because of how new it is to the industry. So just choose your firm wisely, or even more preferable, have more than one. Most discount broker dealers don‚Äôt have account fees.

$SLV Broke?,2376,ljmwyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmwyt/slv_broke/,1191,1613331640.0,"So it looks like after the inflow last week to silver , $SLV finally admitted the scam they have been running. I am curious how this effects price.  Does paper silver finally squeeze or do people flee $SLV?  

Basically what happened: normally $SLV is supposed to cover their positions with physical silver.  They have been ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to buy positions with physical silver and the fund always acted as a surrogate for the price of physical silver.  Well... recently they updated their prospectus page 7 
https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/prospectus/p-ishares-silver-trust-prospectus-12-31.pdf

It essentially says that they may not be able to find physical silver to cover positions, finally admitting what has been known for years, that silver supply is way less than demand.  I am sure they saw a potential surge in pricing and are trying to cover themselves from potential lawsuits should ‚Äúauthorized dealers‚Äù want to take delivery of their lots of silver from their $SLV position.

This will likely surge the price of physical silver but I am curious does paper silver rocket up also? Does $SLV break? Does paper and physical finally decouple?",2021-02-14 21:40:40

"META: Extend The ""No Politics"" rule to all 'movements' that do not try to make money",989,ljmqb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmqb7/meta_extend_the_no_politics_rule_to_all_movements/,331,1613330705.0,"It wasn't necessary before to have a rule against purposefully losing money for some ""cause"", but I believe with the amount of spam about G-M-E, and with people unironically arguing ""this is a fight of good vs. evil"", such a rule would be a good addition.


The quality of WSB in the past was always that people tried to make money. Some people tried to make money by being really smart and others were just absolutely degenerate or thought they found an ""infinite money glitch"" on RobinHood. But all of them had the GOAL OF MAKING MONEY. That also meant, all of them could admit they were wrong when they lost money.



If I see a post titled ""Here's why I hold XYZ"", then I expect that the post has some reasoning about why XYZ will make me money. I do not expect an argument about MuH eViL hEdGe FuNdS that **blatantly admits** that there is no profit motive in holding XYZ.



**That's why I propose to extend the ""No Politics"" rule to all posts/comments that are about holding /promoting to hold a stock without the motive of making profits.**



Edit: just to illustrate what I mean with my rule proposal - someone just commented this and I feel it's important enough to edit the post.

An acceptable post from the frontpage right now is https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljck0s/why_i_am_super_bullish_on_gme/, which talks about shorts needing to cover and that will make money from GME.  Might be wrong, but it's making money.

An unacceptable post is https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljkpgj/why_i_am_gme/, which talks about how this is a moral fight and includes the line ""I don't even want to win back my money.""

Why you actually should consider CRSR,419,ljmded,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljmded/why_you_actually_should_consider_crsr/,222,1613328905.0,"In case you live under a rock, [CRSR is growing faster than it can handle and remains supply limited](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)

Corsair just moved very aggressively into SSDs and dominates the RAM market. A chip company  growing revenue at 80% should be valued more like AMD or NVDA.

For some reason, I still associate Corsair with their peripherals such as mice and keyboards. They also do gaming chairs, ring lights, green screens, microphones, headphones... If you compare them to their peer Logitech (LOGI), Corsair is growing revenue at a faster rate, but has lower profit margins. I have all the aforementioned stockerinos, but I generally favor growth over profitability. 

The YOLO trade in all of this is Friday 2/19 calls at $45 but the larger brain play is simply to go long or maybe 3/19 because the premium on most of these seems way too high for a lowly gorilla.

Please be careful in this cycle,307,ljlct9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljlct9/please_be_careful_in_this_cycle/,204,1613323462.0,"This was posted on another subreddit that discusses investments that is not allowed on WSB. So I changed the name of that kind of investment to stock. I felt that it needs to be seen by some people on WSB. 

Originally posted by u/BCNUGGZ 

The pervasive sentiment that Stocks will only go up, is going to get people hurt.  It is a toxic methodology that has infected the masses to an extent that it is causing naive people to do things they would never do in hopes of catching the next moon stock. Even when they achieve 10X+ paper gains, they fail to have an exit strategy and hold til there‚Äôs nothing left. There will be families ruined, homes lost, and unfortunately even lives ended out of desperation.  If this seems outlandish, I can assure you it is not. Anyone that has been around long enough to experience more than one stock/securities cycle, can attest to the extreme euphoria and mania that accompanies the peak of the bubble.  

**Know that the market makers intentionally spread messages of ‚Äúnever sell‚Äù and ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù as a grossly effective way to leave small retail investors holding the bag as they exit with their slimy profits.  They want you to remain ignorant... it helps to prop up the price of an asset while they dump their holdings to oblivion. This holds true in any major market, I have been exposed to some of the inner workings of a securities brokerage house, they are absolutely out to separate you from your money.**

I say this, not to scare anyone, or to cause panic in the community... I say this in hopes that people will stop and think before they sink money into something they do not understand. I hope it will motivate you to do actual research on the projects you are told will ‚Äúmoon‚Äù... I hope that you take the time to learn some elementary fundamental and technical analysis, and how to protect your principle with simple tools like limit orders and stop loss orders. Learn about simple fib extensions and fib retracements to formulate a plan for your price targets instead of guessing or panic buying/selling. I hope the message will motivate people to take profits when prudent, and to avoid the urge to be overly greedy. I hope it will motivate you to learn to invest like a professional. 

There is an unfathomable amount of money to be made within the stock sphere, but don‚Äôt let this cloud your judgement when it comes to using rationale and educating yourself to be a smart investor... not just a moon hodler.  Stocks is still in its toddler stage, there is more than enough time to educate yourself on ways to protect your investments and learn about proper capital management. If you take anything from this, let it be this:  There will ALWAYS be another opportunity to make gains in the market... there is no rush in growing a portfolio. Preventing a $1 loss is just as powerful as making a $1 gain... principle preservation is paramount in the quest to grow a life-changing portfolio.  

If this message saves just 1 person from being financially ruined when this current cycle ends, it will be worth all of the inevitable downvotes it will receive.  I do not want your awards, I do not want your upvotes... I want you all to take your rightful piece of the pie and be educated enough to effectively protect it. 

I wish you all the best, and look forward to seeing an endless stream of screenshots showing stock wins.

Unga bunga unga bunga: At&t DD,21,ljlatb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljlatb/unga_bunga_unga_bunga_att_dd/,46,1613323188.0,"Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. It‚Äôs HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It‚Äôs quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it‚Äôs mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It‚Äôs not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It‚Äôs a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous).

That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, ""invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda...""

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

7. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it‚Äôs negative or not, but it probably isn‚Äôt much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.",2021-02-14 19:19:48

Why XM is the Most Underrated High Growth Stock,21,ljjqyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljjqyl/why_xm_is_the_most_underrated_high_growth_stock/,25,1613315586.0,"Qualtrics (ticker XM) IPO'd on Jan 28th and has received little attention compared to other IPOs this year. It initially shot up from $41 to $57 and has since sold off to $45 as of Feb 12.

Qualtrics sells subscription SAAS products that allow companies to obtain and track data on customer, product, and employee experiences. Like other SAAS companies, XM's gross margins are 75%, and it currently has a market cap of $23 billion.

Here's why Qualtrics is the most underrated high growth stock:

\- With 2020 revenue of $763 million and 31% revenue growth between 2019 and 2020, Qualtrics will reach $1 billion revenue in 2021 assuming a conservative flat growth rate. This is a forward Price to Sales ratio of 23, over 2x cheaper than other software database companies including SNOW, PLTR, and DDOG.

\- SAP owns 80% of outstanding shares, with at least an additional 5% owned by institutions. With minimal float, the stock is primed to rise quickly with any news, including coverage initiations and institutional purchases over next few weeks as Qualtrics gains more attention.

\- The stay-at-home trend means more businesses are investing in remote work tools and services, creating demand for experience management products. Qualtrics increased its customers from 9,000 to 13,000 in the past 2 years, and the digital shift caused by COVID will only accelerate this growth.

\- Technically, the stock is ready to bounce. In the past 6 trading days, selling has been consistently decreasing in magnitude and volume, and this week, the trend looks like it's going to reverse.

Disney+ also just announced about 52 new Star Wars shows and if you know anything about Star Wars fans, they fucking love their merchandise. And guess what, Hasbro makes it. 

Lastly, and I know nothing about this but we‚Äôve all heard of the game. Magic the Gathering. Apparently they‚Äôve doubled their player base in 2020 and expect to double again by ‚Äò23.

For those that know about Trivago, it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels.  This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out, I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2.00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out. Also, Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company. Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare. With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow, Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition. Trivago may benefit with these surges.

I am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5.00. I believe 5.00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now. If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move, but I am going to sell monthly covered call @ 5.00.

# Beaten Down Stocks Respond Aggressively to good news

* Often time stocks that are at all time lows just need a single small catalyst to respond aggressively to the upside.
   * Gamestop's investment from Ryan Cohen is an example of a catalyst that drove a huge increase in Gamestop's game price.
* A few years ago Trivago was trading at \~23.00 dollars per share. As of Friday it was trading around 3.00, an 87% decrease. As of two years ago, it was in the mid to high single digits.
* Revenue has steadily declined for a few years and the pandemic itself was no help.
   * A new large partnership, or an adjacent product category expansion like airline travel or car rentals are a potential catalyst.
* The recovery will begin mid year

# Pent up demand, stimulus, oil prices and desperate airlines might make travel boom this year and a strong start for 2022.

* Everyone is ready for a vacation, period, end of story.
* The airline industry is struggling and they are desperate for cash flow. Airlines will have reason to push for low cost or at cost flights to ensure they are maximizing their cash flow on their assets,
* Airlines are going to most likely focus on efficiency this year and continue to have less flights with higher occupancy.
* Studies are showing that the pandemic has pushed people to the point where they will travel and this summer could set records.

# TRIVAGO MANAGEMENT and LEANER Company

* Trivago has a healthy balance sheet of \~200M cash
* Trivago had a net loss of 9M last quarter
* Trivago can maintain suppressed travel for quite a while and their low capital business model can flex quickly.

# RISKS

**There are Risks- Trivago has seen revenue decline even pre pandemic, this is a play that assumes Trivago emerges stronger, that their new CEO has growth plans, that emerging markets play a significant role in the coming years and that other potential adjacent expansion happens. I believe Trivago can do well, even just firing their pedophile spokesman might do wonders for their branding.**

In one week ending this past Wednesday, $22.9 billion flowed into stock funds.

This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.

In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.

BofA‚Äôs gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull &amp; Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn‚Äôt been set off since January 2018, according to the note.

Let's say I short a stock at 5 dollars. If there was a huge increase in the stock I could again short the stock at the highest point. When it drops, the money I make from that transaction would cover multiple short positions that were originally at 5 dollars. Say I took action to cover at 300/share. Only a week later it's at 50/share. I can now cover 5 of those losing short positions for the loss of my profit on that trade (which puts me effectively at zero) since there was a net profit of 250 on that single trade when it closed.

There may still be short positions, but they are there to ""cover"" other short positions. Let me give you two examples in trading call and put options.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

1) I believe the market will go up, and want to make a safe marginal premium while I wait. I sell one call option above with strike price above the stock price, and buy another with strike price considerably lower than the one I sold (and below the stocks market price). Now I got a call option on a discount, theirs is above the current value of the market (more likely to expire), and I get to keep my valuable call option or exercise it before it's near expiry.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2) I believe the market will go down. I sell one call option with strike price close to the stock price (but still above), then buy another one with a much higher strike price(this one can be far out of the money). If the market does go down I lose the price of the call option I bought, but I have a net premium in the end.

Inminent bull run for the Uranium market?,356,ljiul3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljiul3/inminent_bull_run_for_the_uranium_market/,293,1613311784.0,"# The world needs clean-air energy

There is growing recognition of the role nuclear power must play in providing safe, reliable, affordable carbon-free baseload electricity and achieving a low-carbon future. Examples of this growing recognition include:

* Many countries, US states, and utilities announced net-zero carbon targets in 2020. While most of these targets are further out in the future, many of the plans include an important role for nuclear. For example, a study suggests that for China to achieve its net-zero target by 2060, will require a 382% increase in nuclear power from 2025 levels.
* In the US, President Biden‚Äôs campaign included positive statements about the need to maintain the existing nuclear power fleet and to build advanced reactors as part of an overall shift to non-emitting carbon power sources.
* Japan‚Äôs Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. Regarding nuclear, he indicated Japan will continue to develop its nuclear energy supply with ‚Äúmaximum priority on safety‚Äù. Japan‚Äôs current energy plan calls for 20% to 22% nuclear by 2030.
* In France, President Macron stated in December that nuclear will remain a pillar of the French energy mix for decades to come and pressed for preparatory studies on new next-generation EPR reactors to be wrapped up in the coming months.
* The Netherlands announced they will begin a process that considers building up to 10 nuclear power plants.
* According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are currently 443 reactors operating globally and 52 reactors under construction. With a number of reactor construction projects recently approved, and many more planned, the demand for uranium is growing.

# Supply-Demand

Like other commodities, **the uranium industry is cyclical.** History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production. Once that production is in the market, it tends to stay in the market longer than is economically rational, creating the perception that uranium is abundant and always will be, and prices decline. When prices are declining and low, like we have seen over the past number of years, there is no perceived urgency to contract, and contracting activity and investment in new supply drops off. **After years of low investment in supply, as has been the case since 2011, security of supply tends to overtake price concerns at some point, and utilities re-enter the long-term market to ensure they have the reliable supply of uranium they need to run their reactors.**

Customers do not go to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services have to be purchased years in advance, allowing time for a number of processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle. The longer the recovery of the long-term market is delayed, the less certainty there will be about the availability of future supply to fill growing demand. **Recent data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that utility inventories are starting to decline and are approaching levels that could put security of supply at risk, there is a significant amount of uranium that needs to be contracted to keep reactors running into the next decade.**

As utilities‚Äô uncovered requirements grow, annual supply declines, demand for uranium from producers and financial players increases, and with trade policy potentially restricting access to some markets, the pounds available in the spot market will not be adequate to satisfy the growing backlog of long-term demand. As a result, **there will be increased competition to secure uranium under long-term contracts on terms that will ensure the availability of reliable primary supply to meet growing demand.**

Global population is on the rise, and there is a growing focus on electrification and decarbonization. With the world‚Äôs need for safe, clean, reliable baseload energy, nuclear remains an important part of the energy mix. With demand increasing due to restarts and new reactors, and supply becoming less certain as a result of low prices, production curtailments, lack of investment, and end of reserve life, unplanned production disruptions, shrinking secondary supplies and trade policy issues, a market transition is expected.

Does adding digi assets to balance sheet defend against shorts?,6,ljijpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljijpt/does_adding_digi_assets_to_balance_sheet_defend/,27,1613310579.0,"With Tesla adding an asset class does this prevent shorts from heavily stacking against it? Digi assets provide sudden spikes due to its high volatility and can knock shorts suddenly making it risky. Can this be a new corporate defense? 

Company's balance sheet can also dip, but eps won't react as much. But if a company's balance sheet receives sudden spikes prior to quarterly earnings, this can be a consistent shakeoff throughout the year. Digi prices are transparent throughout. 

As a concept, why or why not? This is not a troll but conceptually can it work?

Also.. imagine if shorts are stacking, a prominent person or news can tweet to trigger price spikes and shake the leaves off a tree. It could work..its so hard to short on margin.

Added from mini discussion below: This move is a hedge against the dollar and other currencies. As long as we are in an inflationary cycle from the fed govts, then this is a viable move for a company. Other threads discussed prices not moving and is a worthwhile read.

There are very few industries that have been completely, 100% shut down for the entirety of the pandemic. The cruiseship industry is one of them. There‚Äôs a lot of fear around the stock, but now that vaccine distribution is on the rise it‚Äôs inevitable that cruising will resume. For cruise line companies, the strategy is simple: if you have proof of being vaccinated, you can board the ship‚Ä¶ the only issue is the government giving them the go-ahead, which is just a matter of time.

The way I see it, there are three ways you can approach this opportunity.

**Low risk**: buy NCLH shares and hold

**Medium risk**: Jan 21 2022 $30c

**The WSB special**: Sep 17 2021 ???c

-‚ÄúThe shares have been diluted.‚Äù Yes, it won‚Äôt return to the $60 highs anytime soon‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt have to. Optimistically, the shares could reach $40 if there‚Äôs proof of cruising being successful again.

The bond prices in 2020 was around 6% percent where all the boomers could just remove there money from market and still make more than 6% of gains over here.  The year ended with 5.12 percent.  Currently the 10 year old bond rate is 1.1 percent which is less than 1.4 percent inflation for the month of January.  This means every person who is invested in bond market is losing money when compared to inflation. There is no place for investors to park money to give steady gains unlike in 2000 where you can sell from stocks and go to bond Market.

The US government has injected around $5 trillion dollar with various stimulus plans in the last 12 months. This is almost a quarter of GDP of USA and the party is not done yet.

But what is it? Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.

**About Them**

MicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.

Sumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.[ Source](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d)

Why have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?

**Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.**

The reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like ""Wtf is this? I need to get puts"" But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million [equity facility (loan) in December](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html) that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing [Vanguard](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group) and [Blackrock to invest](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock) in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.

[ MVIS \(left\) vs PLUG \(right\) 1990's until present ](https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63)

Anyways, what is this ""much more advanced"" technology? I'll just let this chart do the talking:

[ The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.](https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8)

The resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.

That chart is from 2 years ago and *still* the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the ""[Alpha Prime](https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)""

>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: \~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: \~ 4,800,000 points per second.

VLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost[ $75,000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020). I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime[ costing $100,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiDAR/comments/emp7h4/where_to_get_a_used_velodyne_alpha_prime_vls128/fdqguty?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) That was last year, will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase. They did [announce a $500 model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f) called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its [""outstanding""](https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/)... lol.

As for Luminar (LAZR),[ they will launch the new model ""Iris"" in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/) (the[ same price](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html) as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that **this is unplayable.**

>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.

A[ lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/) has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was ""300dpi/spdeg"", a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here's the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:

>Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of ""**up to** 200 points per square degree"" and a FOV of 120¬∞ x 30¬∞ (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)  
>  
>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1¬∞ to 30¬∞ , which likely explains the use of ""up to"" in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren't allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.  
>  
>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120¬∞ x 30¬∞? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120¬∞ x 5¬∞? The use of ""up to"" suggests the latter.  
>  
>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120¬∞ x 30¬∞ is available, which is not conceded given the stated ""up to"", that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more ""mechanical"" including, as per a recent patent,[ spindles and a drive belt](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1)  
>  
>(1) At video time **19:56**, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar, **Iris**, will support resolution of **300 points per square degree at 10 Hz**. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = **10.8M points per second**. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims **20M points per second** for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.

TLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.

Again the [MicroVision Consumer LIDAR](http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) ([specifications](http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the ""1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor"",[ will be coming in April](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html).

>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This **equates** **to** 520 points per square degree.

(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn't say **up to**)

It testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications

>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.

What is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?

https://preview.redd.it/n4c8831l9dh61.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=0652984c72da3159b53a4fc4058c9d9e33cc6b05

Level 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology **today**, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced? It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors.

If their devices can really recognize people, objects, and pets, it could integrate security verticals in MicroVision's business model. ([Video surveillance is expected to reach a 144.5 B market size by 2027](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-surveillance-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-144-85-billion-by-2027---valuates-reports-301056561.html#:~:text=The%20global%20IP%20video%20surveillance,CAGR%20from%202019%20to%202026)) Why not just use cameras?[ Cameras are worse at long distances](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/tb/stories/blog/37699),

So, will testing be successful?

**Growing Industry**

The self-driving cars market[ is expected to reach 220.44 billion](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/self-driving-cars-market) dollars by 2025. This includes taxi, civil, public transport, heavy duty trucks, ride shares, and ride hail (UBER - 72 B mkt cap) applications.

Traffic Accidents ***in the US alone*** [Cost 871 Billion A Year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/motor-vehicle-crashes-u-s-cost-871-billion-year-federal-study-finds#:~:text=federal%2Dstudy%2Dfinds-,Traffic%20accidents%20in%20the%20U.S.%20cost,a%20year%2C%20federal%20study%20finds&text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economic%20and%20societal,National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration), even just yesterday there was an[ insane pileup](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/traffic/traffic-updates-overnight-sleet-turns-north-texas-roads-into-sheets-of-ice/2548822/) on the I-35W highway in Texas that killed 6, injured 36, and damaged 133 vehicles.

Not only self-driven cars need LiDAR. In a few years, as soon as MicroVision's 1st Gen LRL is available, LiDAR systems will certainly become mandatory for (still) human-controlled cars to avoid collisions. This tech could become as revolutionary and successful as airbags.[ Airbags are a 37.3 billion dollar industry](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/airbag-market#:~:text=Global%20Airbag%20Market%20is%20expected,and%20deflate%20after%20the%20accident).

If only 10% of the[ cars produced](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262747/worldwide-automobile-production-since-2000/) annually contain four Microvision LRL systems, this will result in a volume of 364 million units in ten years. (9.1 million cars \* 4 modules \* 10 years) And this is a conservative calculation, both a higher market share, more cars produced, and more modules per car are conceivable.

[ At least 4 LRL devices will be necessary to establish a \\""circle of safety.\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/fvv8wt9m9dh61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=82d96f0adbe3a23edb5678ed4525d7c3ac6bf6e8)

Whoever has the MicroVision technology may be able to eliminate the competition or demand license fees from them. Or the other way around: Whoever does not buy the technology can be excluded from markets. Therefore, bidding competition may arise to gain access to the market. Whoever has the best LiDAR system for cars will also be able to supply other components and software to car manufacturers. The car manufacturer who has the best LiDAR system has a big advantage over the competition.

LAZR is currently valued at 12.22B

VLDR at 3.92B

MVIS at 2.77B

MicroVision offers a quantitatively much higher performance product than both of its competitor companies. Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies, competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses, healthcare, engineering, military equipment, GPS safety, entertainment, and interactive projectors. They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point, due to grow massively in the near future. Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years. I have never seen a company with such low insider selling, that the last case of a sale was in 2014. Institutional investors are piling in as MicroVision's balance sheet improves and they near the April LRL sensor test date, which has a high likelihood of being a success. I think this stock should currently be valued at 20 Billion dollars, taking all of this into account, and expect it to rise drastically over the next few years.

PM (don‚Äôt @ me I know) and the Tar Train to Tendie Town,14,ljghrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljghrh/pm_dont_me_i_know_and_the_tar_train_to_tendie_town/,57,1613302797.0,"# Introduction:
With the exception of possibly fracking you won‚Äôt find an industry that‚Äôs more frowned upon than big Tobacco. And yes I know Phillip Morris cigarettes personally jumped through the window and murdered your nana or something (the jury is still out on the whole ‚Äúscience‚Äù thing I‚Äôm fairly certain). 
# But wait! You say. Aren‚Äôt cigarettes a dying industry? 
Yes, yes they are now shut the fuck up and strap your helmets on while I explain the three reasons why that‚Äôs ok: 

> 1). You know what I like to do when I‚Äôm out at a bar? (Other than getting blackout drunk and trying to convince people I‚Äôm the bastard son of Nikki Sixx). That‚Äôs right, buy an overpriced pack of cancer sticks and smoke every fuckin‚Äô one of them. So when the hip youth finally get out of lock down and head back to the club who‚Äôs coming with them? *Ding* *Ding* It‚Äôs motherfuckin‚Äô Camel Joe and the Marlboro Kid ‚Äîor whatever the fuck wacky mascot institutional cancer has these days.
 
> 2). Smokeless tobacco/vaping/boofing pipe tobacco, doesn‚Äôt have the same negative sentiment as smoking, approximately everyone under the age of 25 (I can‚Äôt count fuck off) has developed a vape habit while you‚Äôve been watching the PLTR ticker and if you think the biggest players in the nicotine game aren‚Äôt getting a piece of that I have a bridge in New York to sell you. I‚Äôm not gonna weigh in on if that‚Äôs actually any better for you because ‚Äîagain, not a doctor and for all I know vape fever is gonna cause everyone‚Äôs dicks to fly off and their eyes to explode. But I believe that even a micrometer of positive public sentiment would drive investor confidence higher than your moms libido (ok, probably not that high, but you get my drift). 
  
> 3). Marijuana. This elephant has been in the room for a long damn time, and is pure speculation but if I was a floundering tobacco giant trying to stay relevant I know what industry I‚Äôd diversify into. And unlike many popular marijuana stocks this company actually has *money* which is ‚Äî I‚Äôve been told, fairly important to running a business. 

# FINANCIALS: or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the stock: 

I‚Äôm not going to beat around the bush here, the glory days are gone for PM, all the üåàüêª laws have stopped inter-office smoking parties, you can‚Äôt smoke in the McDonalds play area, it‚Äôs rough. But what‚Äôs this? A positive EPS? Why yes yes it is. And the tobacco packaging industry [is projected to grow ](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tobacco-packaging-market-to-2030-projected-for-healthy-growth-rate-by-marketresearchbiz-amcor-limited-innovia-films-ltd-2021-02-12) healthily into 2030. PM is currently trading at a P/E of 16.21 which is less than MO (90) or UVV(21.8) but higher than BTI (10.9) 
It also pays something called a ‚ÄúDIVY-den‚Äù of ~5.6% I‚Äôm not a boomer üåàüêª but I think this is some kind of house (den= house for üêª) that you count money in (Divy= old fashioned pirate term for counting or dividing loot), unfortunately you can only get these weird bear-houses when you buy these boomer options called ‚Äúchairs‚Äù that never expire (?) even after more than TWO weeks (crazy I know). 

# My bet/ positions: 
 
I think that not only will tobacco retail see a decent pop post COVID, they are positioned to capitalize on the federal legalization of marijuana we‚Äôre all so fond of jerking off over. In fact I believe PM may be better positioned than some marijuana specific companies (this is highly speculative). Additionally while global smoking rates are decreasing,  there is still a growing market share in [certain ](https://tobaccoatlas.org/topic/consumption/) countries. I‚Äôm not balls deep in this trade yet but will be executing it on Tuesday at open and will update afterwards

Edit: I gotta add that these absolute mad lads have managed to INCREASE revenues on a DECREASE in sales because once you go black (lung) you never go back. They also already own a cannabis company: CRON ‚Äîso there‚Äôs that.
There are only two things I‚Äôve never been able to quit: smoking, gambling, and your mom (transcribers note: this is more than two things but my client was very insistent that ‚Äú numbers don‚Äôt even go that high‚Äù and that ‚Äúno one actually knows how to read‚Äù)Take from that what you will.
Based on some new info I‚Äôve seen MO may be better positioned in the space due to magic numbers making their P/E better than it appears. If anyone‚Äôs interested I‚Äôll do a write up on that as well",2021-02-14 13:39:57
I sharpened my crayon set for this NOK dd....I hope you enjoy,498,ljgcui,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgcui/i_sharpened_my_crayon_set_for_this_nok_ddi_hope/,145,1613302298.0,"I was in NOK before the craziness of a couple weeks ago. I still am, and have been accumulating under $5 pretty heavily. Average is right around $4.50.

Disclaimer: I own 2500 shares of NOK, and 65 Jan 2022 $10C.

I am fully aware that P/E valuation isn't the best method of valuation for a stock, but I did some rough math to set a PT for myself. I'm very long on this stock, and I don't foresee myself selling a majority of my position anytime in the life cycle of 5G networks. Anyway, in my math, I realized a wild undervaluation IMO on NOK.

***P/E Breakdown*** *(these numbers are a bit old as I did the math earlier this week, and my first attempt to post this got removed for some reason)*

Currently NOK has a P/E ratio of just under 14 (it got down to just above 13 at it's low on Thursday)

* The most applicable comparator stock we can us is ERIC which has a PE of 20.29
* The telecom provider industry as a whole has a PE of 21.26
* Trailing EPS is .31, and this is where it gets a bit interesting. Their previous ER yielded an EPS of .17. The previous CEO instilled a methodology to increase profitability and free cash flow, and the current CEO has been pursuing that relentlessly. These efforts were yielding results even in the midst of COVID.
* If you forecast out a moderate EPS of .17 for the next 3 quarters and keep the PE the same. The stock price would be... **$9.52.** I'm aware that they may not achieve this amount of EPS per ER going forward, but I think that is a decent (perhaps conservative) baseline to operate off of.
* One gap I see that the market is missing on the entire industry is giving it a very conservative outlook. As 5G networks mature and transition into 6G and beyond, the opportunities for steady cash flow and increasing margins and revenue will abound in this industry. Going forward, I feel that a ratio of 25 applied to the industry NOK operates in would be appropriate (and again...perhaps conservative). For reference, Apple's current PE is 37 and AMD's is 82. Not good comparators, but everyone knows these companies and what they do, so they can draw their own conclusion.
* If we were to apply the conservative .17 EPS x 4 and the new industry wide PE to NOK stock, we would yield a PT of... **$17**

**2 Things that could change the equation in a hurry**

**#1 - Reinstate Dividends**

In their previous ER, they said they would give an update on their dividend reinstatement by March 18th (when they hold their annual ""Capital Markets Day"" event). I'm on WSB, so you know I'm a betting man, and if there were a place to wager if they were or were not going to reinstate dividends, I would be all in on that they are going to reinstate. They stopped dividends to pump up R&D into 5G (and probably 6G) and to increase FCF.

If they do reinstate dividends, just on a cursory glance of an ETF database, there is close to $2.5B AUM in EU Dividend focused ETFs. I would assume a large number of these ETFs would pick up NOK, and if they are market cap weighed, they will pick it up heftily. I'm sure there are a number of US based ETFs with a dividend focus that would add NOK as well.

This accumulation would definitely kick start a movement in the price, and could change the way boomers/HFs view NOK.

**#2 - Infrastructure Stimulus**

There is no doubt that some massive stimulus packages in the EU/US will be passed at some point this year...on top of the $1.9T that is currently in process. Both the Biden administration and the ECB chair (Christine Lagarde) are big fans of infrastructure stimulus. 5G is literally mentioned on the Biden website...[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)

In the time since trying to post this and now, this article came out about Biden/China/infrastructure. Remember, when Biden says infrastructure, 5G is a big part of that.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245)

In a time where such data intensive processes are on the forefront of the economy (transition to ""alternative currencies"", autonomous cars, etc.) there will be a desire to invest heavily into networks that can meet those data demands. There has been no signal that the US is going to pivot away from the Huawei ban, giving NOK and other companies a chance to pick up huge swaths of market share...

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist)

That should give you comfort that NOK's ability to compete and be an ""oligopoly-esque"" player in mobile networks going forward in the US. On top of that, Nokia was chosen to lead the EU's project researching 6G networks....

[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/07/nokia-to-lead-the-eus-6g-project-hexa-x/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/07/nokia-to-lead-the-eus-6g-project-hexa-x/)

TL:DR - NOK's future is bright both long term, and short term. The current fundamental valuation on the company is deeply flawed and undervalued. Will we have üöÄ in the short term? IDK, I think we will, but definitely üöÄ in the long term.",2021-02-14 13:31:38
Plays for when the eviction moratoriums end?,31,ljg64m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljg64m/plays_for_when_the_eviction_moratoriums_end/,87,1613301616.0,"At some point, probably this year, most of the city/county/state moratoriums on evictions will end.  When that happens, what companies will be most likely to benefit?

I thought about this one for awhile and came up with a couple:

*   Storage Units.  People are going to need a place to put all their stuff, after all.  They might be able to move in with friends/family for awhile, but their crap sure can't come too.  I'd expect the cost of a storage unit to be manageable for most.
*  Camping and outdoor gear.  A bit morbid, but not everyone will be able to move in with friends/family, and pitching a tent (haw) might be their only option.

For storage unit companies, I took a position in two of them, PSA (the largest) and EXR (I see many new locations going up in my area, and they are much nicer in appearance than PSA).

For camping/outdoor gear, I went with NWL.  It has a lot of brands within it, including inexpensive outdoor gear.

An increase in evictions is inevitable, so any other companies that would be well positioned to benefit?

There's also currently a credible rumor from a stocktwit user saying that Musk is taking Tesla private and then is going to take it public again but this time through a Spac deal. Based on all of this it's undervalued and you're guaranteed profit because Tesla is heavily shorted and once the short squeeze happens(which will definitely happen) then it will skyrocket.

"NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE?",603,ljdboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljdboy/nok_nok_whose_there/,143,1613291825.0,"**Current Status Report:**

* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.

* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.

* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.

* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.

**The Bull Case:**

* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.

* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.

* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.

* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.

* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any ""early bird"" advantage.

* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.

* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.

* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.

* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.

**The Bear Case:**

* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.

* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?

* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. 

**Summary Recommendations:**

**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.

**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of ""price erosion"" and ""difficult year"" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.

**Important Disclaimer:** 

NOK is a relatively safe investment, not necessarily a good one. If you find a better opportunity in another stock while waiting for NOK to moon - don't be afraid to take it. Do not get sucked into sunk cost fallacy if you bought in at a high price.",2021-02-14 10:37:05

For this post, let's say you hypothetically bought a meme stock and then it crashed. But some dumbass on the internet tells you to buy more and lower your cost. Should you do it???

**Q: Wait, so I should never average my cost down?**

A: Jesus, calm down, I'm getting there.

Here's the actual optimal strategy, from wikipedia again:

> At any moment in time, the best thing to do depends only on¬†current¬†alternatives. The only things that matter are the¬†future¬†consequences.¬†Past mistakes are irrelevant.

Okay so let me translate this for the crayon eating bagholders.

Imagine someone forces you to sell your shares at the current market price. So now you have $11.54 from that fractional share and don't hold any meme stock. 

Now, use all 7 of those brain cells to pretend you are in this situation, then ask ""Out of all possible investments, where should I put my money?""

The right answer might be ""this meme stock just crashed and looks like a great buy"", or maybe not. Idk, I'm not your mom.

The other advantage of cashing out is that you get to use the loss from those bags to offset your others gains (fucking lol, yeah right).

Why DNA rather than other vaccine platforms? DNA vaccines hold several advantages over other modalities, including mRNA. RNA is inherently unstable. It‚Äôs naturally a transient molecule. Thus, vaccine developers need to adjust RNAs to make them last long enough beyond administration to take therapeutic effect. RNA also requires mechanisms for amplification and intervention from special enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase) that can be difficult and expensive to produce. DNA-based vaccines are simpler and have fewer technological requirements than those based on mRNA. 

DNA plasmids are inexpensive to produce, and DNA has greater stability than RNA. Thus, instead of fading away after a few days, administered DNA can remain in cells and continue to express target antigens for months at a time, resulting in durable protection.
Using DNA also enables quick and inexpensive manufacturing of hundreds of millions of doses per year.

Because DNA is stable at room temperature DNA vaccines without need for elaborate cold-chain support. We even can lyophilize the drug substance for formulation into sublingual tablets or oral capsules.ü¶†

How to not get caught with your pants down for cheap.,0,ljbncm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbncm/how_to_not_get_caught_with_your_pants_down_for/,69,1613286352.0,"VERY IMPORTANT EDIT:
I was looking at some comments and reread a certain part of my post. When I say buy put/call options I mean to buy the same amount of each - same expiry date and same strike price. Often you do this near the current stock price, because it is cheapest, and because you think it will move substantially from that specific price, however you're unsure how it will move. It's called a ""long straddle"" spread, and they're especially successful in volatile markets. If you have a strong feeling about direction,  it might be better to simply buy one of the two options, and that's actual gambling. If I see another stock bubble up I know I'll be betting down, because it's easy to predict an overinflated stock going down.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I'm a retard who wants to make money, but I've been struggling to make good plays. It's been a fucking rollercoaster, so I decided this weekend I'd  devise a strategy to make sure I can still swim when everything inevitably goes sideways.

I know this is a casino, and the point is to accrue debt - all that fun stuff, but there are always good reasons to take a long position, and with how things have been going for people it is in fact a huge gamble, and it's not always clear when to exit. God forbid the swing happens while you're busy with something else and you lose out on not only profit but a big chunk of your money too.

**During a rise**
The most obvious way to cover yourself is just by buying calls or puts, depending on which is cheaper at the moment. After steady growth over some period of time puts will almost always be cheaper, and the puts you buy during this growth period might very well be more expensive than the stock you had in the first place if the stock tanks 30%. Even if you buy cheaper puts that don't completely cover you, you stand in a much better position to exit.

**Stagnant period after massive growth**
For some reason this is where people think they should buy in, but I assure you if you weren't there for the rise you're literally going to end up buying stock from degenerates who just got rich, your grandmother or a weed farmer. I suggest buying puts below the stock price and moving on to something else, but if you find yourself here with a long position after just getting a nice gain it's important to do one of a few things:

1) get out of there, what the fuck are you waiting for

2) sell everything and buy the calls and puts closest to the stock price

3) sell everything and gamble on one particular direction

4) did I mention to sell everything? I've been mentally compiling data on what happens after a price shoots up like 50% in a day, and I've come to a conclusion. DO NOT WRITE ANY FUCKING COVERED CALL POSITIONS. God, I fucking hate myself so much for this one... At least I got all that premium money, right?

I know all of these positions are pretty gay and bearish, but every one of these meme stocks seem to be overrun by people with amnesia. They looked at a green graph and said ""oh, gee, better buy 1000 calls before I miss out"". It's ridiculously easy to guess when something is completely overvalued, and you can make a lot of money like that too.

**On the other hand**
Alright, I know this is all obvious for many, and I'm probably just wasting my time writing this whole thing, but the opposite applies to falling markets. I already sort of mentioned this, but once the price seems to level off after a drop is when you could stand to make easy money off of uncertainty by just buying calls/puts near the current price. If you caught the stock at its ATH and loaded up on puts, then you probably don't care about this stock anymore and can finally move out of the basement.

Edit: most recent position had 100 in Aphria since it was 15 a week and a half ago. Saw it skyrocket and doubled down. No cover, no exit plan. Worst part was I was doing a vertical bull spread type of strategy and when I woke up the other day I was fucking margin called/no money to exit immediately and had to get out in an absolute fucking panic selling off all sorts of shit.",2021-02-14 09:05:52

I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's blackberry yield would be smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in Central Mexico and a colder-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around the middle of January and prices skyrocketed, but the blackberry bubble burst on on January 28th. Unfortunately, the recent concerns over high-flying stocks driven up by large short covering caused a massive drop-off in demand due to the futures being associated with a Canadian technology company of the same name, and prices plummeted.

Stonk is called Frequency Therapeutics and Barry loves this stonk (proof below)

This is still the ground floor (1.7bn ish market cap) of a company that seems to be far along in the Progenitor Cell activation. Their first endeavor is solving hearing loss for which there are no good alternatives right now (hearing aids dont work for shi) followed by MS. For all you bald aholes out there, don't worry, they will eventually get to you once they solved real issues.

They have an allstar cast at the company including Dr.Langer who is one of the most accomplished scientists in the US. 

My 98% of my portfolio overweight in this bad boy and I believe it's going to be a double win. I'm more interested in them restoring the lives of people truly struggling with hearing loss and tinnitus but I'm also interested in making tendies so that with my new and improved hearing, I can listen to my wife being taken care of by her boyfriend.

I know reading and comprehension is a challenge on this sub but I believe in [some of] you. TLDR at the bottom for the true apes among us.

What the f** is $MA doing talking with CleanSpark- a <1billion market cap, relatively small company? A company that is by all intents and purposes in the energy sector. CleanSpark Inc focuses on solving modern energy challenges. They focus on software solutions that provide energy modeling, energy market communications, and energy management solutions. Okay, and what does that have to do with XBT or $MA?

They own ATL Data Centers, which mines, encrypts, and enables the use of the XBT and other currencies alike. This is HUGE for $MA as just last week they announced a plan to incorporate 'other currencies' into the companies current global business model.

**The company‚Äôs XBT mining segment brought in 32% of total revenue last year and is growing RAPIDLY. This XBT segment ALONE brought in 115-150million last year versus the 30 million expected because of the new processing capacity they have for mining -modern problems require modern solutions. CleanSpark reported an extremely strong and unexpected quarter. With quarterly revenue of 2.26 million, an increase of 130% from .98 million for the prior year.**

This is not a pump and dump. This is not a game to be played. Fellow autists, we are on the cusp of an XBT revolution. CleanSpark has earning reports coming up on 2/23. You will see a jump. You will diamond hand it and you will thank me later.

I think WSB is Playing GME WRONG,38,lj9b2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj9b2j/i_think_wsb_is_playing_gme_wrong/,165,1613279268.0,"I see most of you are probably playing STOCKS rather than options but the irony of this strategy is that WSB or the retail does NOT have enough collateral to actually force the stock price to go up.

At most the retail can bring the price up like $5 judging by the price action last week. And the shorts have been fucking with options for 2 fucking weeks because they can't do anything with dried up shares.

Only way to fuck shorts now with retail buying power?

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

**G1 Therapeutics ($GTHX)** is a biopharmaceutical company developing some really fucking innovative drugs for cancer treatment.

This drug is going to start being distributed in *less than a month*, their earnings report is at the end of this month, and if their breast cancer drug ends up getting approved in a few months as well, I think we are going to see an even bigger boom than what I‚Äôm expecting on Tuesday. Did I mention they‚Äôre up 145% in the last three months, and nearly 65% in the last month alone? 
  
I‚Äôm expecting big things from $GTHX and encourage others to do their own research and see if they‚Äôre seeing the same thing I am: major potential. This is now my biggest position and I‚Äôm excited to see what comes next for them.

Two main mines one in Turkey (drying up) and one in Greece (skouries) have been in trouble for a various reasons. The skouries project  was brought to a halt mainly for environmental reasons and opposition from the previous government.

&#x200B;

EGO is undervalued and currently trading at 13 dollars.

Although EGO performed well during 2020, it has underperformed since 2017. GDX has been up 167% while EGO has is sitting at the same price compared to 4 years ago.

A recent agreement was signed with the greek government week before last that renewed the contract for the skouries and olympias project. This caused the stock price to only jump roughly 12%. When the contract was suspended in 2015, there was a 50% drop.

&#x200B;

Book price is $20

What's the play here? In the next three weeks the new contract will pass through the greek parliament.  If it is indeed ratified, then I do expect a run to 20 fairly soon.  The positive sentiment for metals helps as well.

&#x200B;

There is also a rumor in the street that Newmont ($NEM) may offer a friendly acquisition at $21 if the contract passes through the greek parliament. Eldorado desperately needs more cash for the new project.

# EDIT: The day the contract was signed by the greek government and EGO, apart from the minister and EGO CEO, two other people attended. One was the Canadian ambassador and the other one was the American ambassador.

# EGO is a Canadian company. Newmont is American. There is a rumor about a buyout. What the hell the American ambassador was doing there?

Institutional strategy games with stocks. Game objectives: Build a base on the moon to travel to mars! GME; AMC,79,lj97uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj97uu/institutional_strategy_games_with_stocks_game/,24,1613279020.0,"This is a scenario or a playbook how institutional investors could try to fuck shorty. It just came to my mind and maybe some of you would like to discuss:

If you want to go to mars you will likely first install some base facilities on the moon to prepare your starships for mars. This is a possible playbook to go to mars.   

At the moment it seems like there is some kind of a standoff situation between institutional shorts and longs.

Most of you probably noticed a tweet from an investment company saying: Stay the course? At the same time they heavily increased their positions in AMC.

GME on the other side left a lot of burned ground and is in special interest now because of the hearing and such. So you probably should not try to take this rocket to the moon for the moment. But some say it already made it to the moon, so perhaps it just needs some refueling to become a starship further explore our solar system?

However, if you are an institutional investor you have to think strategic, right? Here is the big what if:

WHAT IF, you are an institutional investor and decide you want to go to mars but need to refuel the rocket on the moon in between. The main problems in GME at the moment are: the burned ground, insecurities of shareholders and the lost momentum of retail buyers. But what if you target another rocket (AMC) first. To overcome the low momentum in GME you need a new story. Now you tweet some cryptic related shit to draw some attention. The same day you publish your new increased positions in AMC. There is much less attention on AMC in comparison to GME right now, so this would probably be the easier game. If you team up with some of your institutional buddies you are maybe able to trigger a squeeze in AMC. There you go! First part successfully completed. AMC rocket on the moon.

There is your new story! If a lot of retail can participate in the squeeze, YOU are the new story. Now there is a bunch of retards pumped with cash sitting on the moon. They will definitely watch you jumping into the rocket RobinHood parked there for you. Now you have a lot of new cash and a temporary fan base of apes. Next you start buying GME, probably OTC and file it to the SEC. Retail would definitely notice even without any extra tweets and jump in. There you have it. Momentum is back and the starship is ready to go to mars.

This is no financial advice. How could it? It‚Äôs a scenario of the conquering of our solar system.  

**TLDR: Use AMC to go to the moon; establish a new base; regain momentum in GME; refuel rocket and go to mars.**",2021-02-14 07:03:40

Upcoming Week 2/19 Geee Em Eeee ITM Options Targets: Playing The Market Fuckery... Pt. 2...,4192,lj8gh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj8gh1/upcoming_week_219_geee_em_eeee_itm_options/,468,1613276771.0," Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000 (yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed. That tells me that they aren't just tanking the price, and that they are playing the options spread at the moment.

It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market. They'd rather keep the price boosted over $50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1,000,000 shares getting into long hands.

But, thankfully, that also let's us know that they're still playing the game. If they were giving up and going into all-or-nothing mode, they wouldn't give a shit about the deliveries. They'd either flood the market with 25,000,000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at $20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines... Or they'd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt.

No, they're still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any (or minimal) legal trouble. That means we're still getting paid. (Eventually...)

I've been watching this for a while now, and I think I've gotten a hand on what they are doing. This coming week will be the tell-all... And I'm going to explain why I believe the price can only go up...

So. Let's crunch the 2/19 option chain and see where this train is headed... - This Week, oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory!... *queue intro music*...

Current price $52:

Put ITM: 59,434

Put OTM: 346,288

Call ITM: 29,930

Call OTM: 87,111

At Current Price, a total of 89,364 option contracts are ITM.

Now, let's look at possible price movement. See, they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single-dollar price change contracts ($41-$42-$43-et al.)... And the five-dollar price change per contract ($50-$55-$60-et al.)

That means that for every dollar that the stock drops, it executes a new Put option contract... But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option. That's why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the $50-$54.99 range all week.

See, because of the contract price structuring, it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower. Allow me to explain:

Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain... And for the nearest $10 swing in prices...

There are 29,337 Put Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 2,459 Put Options for $51-$59 strike.

There are 13,187 Call Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 3,066 Call Options for $51-$59 strike.

Now, lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week.

If the price were to drop by $10, the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16,150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring. 10 Put Options would become in the money.

Conversely, if the price went UP by $9, the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed. Because of the price structuring, only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between $55-$59.

If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price, it equals up to 22,175. That means if the price were to DROP $5, they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2,217,500 shares.

If the price were to go UP by $5, they would only need to find 85,600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at $55.

Let me say that again. If the price goes DOWN... It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments, while the Call Options go up in $5 increments.

It is also interesting to note that ending the week at $59 would cause less deliveries than ending at $55.

My hypothesis: They can't hold the price at $50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent. We only had 12mil-13mil volume the last two days. The shares are drying up.

So if they can't hold the price steady, they need to decide which direction to move it. And based on the math, moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries.

But one thing is for sure. They can't let the price tank any lower this upcoming week. It would trigger too many new deliveries.

(There's actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly $39.99 at close of next week... as odd as that seems)

So what's my non-financially-advising-crystal-ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2/19?...

$58.47...

They are going to allow some big single-day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from $52 up to tickle the $60 mark so that they can go balls-deep selling $60C Premium... And then they will hold the price just below the line.

The next target after that would be $69 (giggity), as there is a large off-set of Calls vs Puts at $70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again. I just don't think they're going to let us get $19 in a single week, as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again.

Tl;dr: We end next week at $58-$59 and the slow bleeding continues until the week of Feb 26.

I'll be back when I finish another model I'm working on...

Akamai Technologies Bullish Thesis,14,lj7bi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj7bi5/akamai_technologies_bullish_thesis/,20,1613273418.0,"Shares of the CDN and cloud security company have dipped about 20% from its January 27th high of $121/share following weaker than expected guidance for 2021 (forecasting 6% growth in revenue).

When I saw that growth estimate I immediately thought they were sand bagging. All of their segments except the web division saw double digit growth in 2020. The first question on the latest analyst call asked why they were forecasting low growth and their CFO said it was due to expectations that their customers in the travel and hospitality division were asking for extended payment terms. I get the concern but that still doesn‚Äôt indicate there are any types of default/missed payments looming on the horizon. That sector will make a comeback.

Akamai continues to see a ton of growth in their cybersecurity segment which exceeded $1 billion in revenue for 2020, or 25% YoY growth. Media and carrier division was up 15% YoY. That makes up more than 60% of their revenue. 

I understand Fastly and Cloudfare are taking market share and growing at ridiculous 40-50% comps but to me both are getting a little bit overvalued and that was evident following NET‚Äôs drop after earnings. Same will likely happen to Fastly next week when they report.

Overall, this looks like a solid value play with Akamai currently trading at 11x EV/EBITDA for the next 12 months. Historically it trades closer to 15x which would put it around $120/share.

Made a quick analysis between the companies factoring in growth and EV for 2021. The lower EV/Sales to growth, the better.

EV/Sales to Growth
AKAM: 0.76
NET: 1.10
FSLY: 0.95


Would love to hear insight from those in the industry! Not really talked about much on investing forums. Seems like most people think AKAM is a legacy/boomer company and that‚Äôs why I am a bit hesitant to invest.

For some annoying reason very often I would see people talking about GME and how it would go up and making posts betting their son's left nut on the stock and making DD's on the matter but I decided that it was a lost cause, there's no way that outdated company was gonna get out of its grave so I would ignore those posts and laugh at them while sitting on my wife's boyfriend's lap. Time passed by and people would really push the idea that GME was gonna rocket and that's when I started to look at that group of people as part of a cult and all they were missing was the robes and shit.

Some time passed and the stock went up a bit to $20+ and I was like ""huh not bad but nothing impressive"", weeks passed and it hit $30+ and I still wasn't convinced because again, nothing too crazy. But then shit started to really hit the fan and saw the numbers to go up faster and faster so I decided to buy in the $60 price range and then the GAMESTOPPENING happened. 

I tried recording myself blowing a load all over my TDA homescreen while looking at the numbers but the quality was shit so just imagine it. Even tho the stock fell I'm gonna hold out of respect for all those ignored DD's and those brave retards that gave their lives making posts about it on WSB.

Moral of the story: Don't underestimate people in WSB. Just because a group of people act, sound or talk like a cult, doesn't mean they're in a cult, they might just be WSB retards who happen to be IN a cult. Also separate everything into small paragraphs cause apes don‚Äôt read no good.

""BlackBerry Shares Showing Signs of Irrational Exuberance; Maintain $6.40 FVE; Shares Overvalued""
William Kerwin
Analyst

Analyst Note | by William Kerwin | **Updated Jan 25, 2021**

No-moat BlackBerry‚Äôs shares have more than doubled this month, but we have seen no material fundamental changes in the business. While small pieces of news concerning the firm‚Äôs licensing business have come out, these have been part of normal business operations, and we don‚Äôt expect them to be material to the firm‚Äôs cash flows. We think the recent price appreciation has been a result of a change in market sentiment rather than improved firm fundamentals. We maintain our $6.40 fair value estimate for BlackBerry and view shares as significantly overvalued.

BlackBerry‚Äôs recent price movements have been concurrent with two pieces of news in January: a sale of 90 patents to Huawei and a patent dispute settlement with Facebook, both of which we think are immaterial to the stock. The patent sale was a small portion of BlackBerry‚Äôs 38,000 patents, related to its discontinued legacy handset business. While terms of the Facebook settlement have yet to come out publicly, we estimate it will have a negligible impact on the firm‚Äôs financials. BlackBerry earns a robust revenue stream from its patent portfolio‚Äî$349 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 (34% of sales)‚Äîdue in large part to aggressively defending its patents in court.

BlackBerry did report material news in December, when it announced a multiyear partnership with Amazon Web Services to co-develop BlackBerry Ivy, a connected cloud software platform for vehicles. The stock‚Äôs rise could also be a delayed reaction to this partnership. However, shares already rose sharply upon the announcement, and there hasn‚Äôt been more news since. We didn‚Äôt see this news as an immediate game changer (at least not as far as 100%-plus stock price appreciation) and we did not raise our fair value estimate based on this partnership announcement.

Finally, management has said that there are no material, undisclosed developments it can attribute to the recent activity.

Business Strategy and Outlook | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
BlackBerry is a software provider selling primarily into enterprise applications of the Internet of Things. Its flagship product is the Spark suite launched in 2020, which combines unified endpoint management with endpoint protection. The firm is also a leading embedded software provider, focused on the automotive industry. Its QNX software powers infotainment systems, where it leads the market, as well as electronic control units and advanced driver-assistance systems. We think BlackBerry has positioned itself in rapidly growing markets that benefit from secular trends, which should fuel top-line growth.

BlackBerry‚Äôs forte is security, with an explicit goal of providing end-to-end secure enterprise communication--just about the only constant between its current business model and the now-retired handset model that made it a household name. The firm performs best in regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare, where security and privacy are more mission-critical. Since John Chen took over as CEO in 2014, he has successfully pivoted BlackBerry to a software model, and the company experienced its first year of revenue growth in nine years in fiscal 2020. The Canadian company‚Äôs pivot was fueled by acquisitions, namely the $425 million deal for Good Technology in 2015 that catapulted BlackBerry to the number-two market share in unified endpoint management, and the $1.4 billion Cylance acquisition in 2018 that gave BlackBerry a foothold in the endpoint protection market.

While we don‚Äôt think BlackBerry has a moat, as some of its larger competitors in the endpoint management and security spaces do, we think the marriage of endpoint management with Cylance‚Äôs proactive threat detection and response will forge a stickier product in Spark. In the short term, we think BlackBerry will focus on its go-to-market strategy as a means to generate organic growth for endpoint software, and seek out further opportunities in autonomous vehicles with its QNX software, as the space presents greater safety/security needs on the part of OEMs, as well as greater content per vehicle for QNX.

Economic Moat | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
We do not believe BlackBerry has an economic moat. Its endpoint management, endpoint security, and embedded systems software solutions compete in highly fragmented markets with relatively low switching costs. While these markets offer moats to larger competitors, we don‚Äôt believe BlackBerry‚Äôs solutions boast adequately competitive stickiness, and we view its negative historical returns on invested capital as evidence to our opinion. Thus, we do not have confidence it will earn returns in excess of its cost of capital over the next 10 years.

BlackBerry‚Äôs software and services segment comprises its flagship Spark suite and its embedded operating system, QNX. Spark combines unified endpoint management, or UEM, software with endpoint protection--what BlackBerry calls unified endpoint security.

UEM provides enterprises with a central interface to monitor and control network access from all endpoints, whether it be employees checking work email on their phones or editing secure documents on a company laptop. BlackBerry‚Äôs UEM capabilities originated from the software the company provided enterprises to manage the prevalent BlackBerry handheld devices used by employees, most notably in the mid-2000s. Although BlackBerry devices faded from relevance, the core of the company‚Äôs software remained. BlackBerry solidified its presence in the UEM space in 2015 with its $425 million acquisition of Good Technology and held the number-three market share in 2018 with 11.2%, per IDC.

BlackBerry also provides endpoint protection through the Spark suite, gained through its acquisition of Cylance for $1.4 billion in 2018. While UEM provides a firm with the ability to monitor and control access across its network, endpoint protection is about external threat prevention, detection, and response across those endpoints.

While it is our view that switching costs occur frequently in enterprise software, given the time, cost, and effort involved in adopting a new solution and running two concurrent solutions simultaneously during the transition, we don‚Äôt think the Spark suite bears moatworthy switching costs. UEM‚Äôs selling point of a centralized solution for all devices presents low switching costs relative to other software that have longer implementation times and intertwine with more companywide operating procedures. UEM implementation is restricted primarily to a customer‚Äôs IT department, while the greater employee base simply needs to download a new app or become accustomed to two-factor authentication. Several of BlackBerry‚Äôs largest competitors in endpoint management have moats, but we think these result from comprehensive portfolios of endpoint solutions and that the fragmented $3 billion UEM market is not enough on its own to bestow a moat on BlackBerry, despite an impressive market share. BlackBerry‚Äôs Cylance acquisition gives it more ammo to compete with larger, more comprehensive incumbents, but it will face an uphill battle winning business from the likes of Microsoft or Symantec. We think Spark (with integrated endpoint protection) is a stickier product than BlackBerry‚Äôs stand-alone UEM software was, but at every competitor these had already been integrated. Furthermore, the stand-alone endpoint security market is even more fragmented than the endpoint management market, featuring experienced, entrenched giants like Microsoft, Symantec, and CrowdStrike. Competing with unique and best-of-breed services like CrowdStrike and the unmatchable breadth of Microsoft, BlackBerry is likely to struggle to keep old clients and win new ones, even with Cylance‚Äôs machine learning and AI detection abilities. Nevertheless, the UEM market is rapidly growing (with estimates ranging from 23% to 36% CAGR through 2024) and BlackBerry remains a leading player. While we anticipate healthy growth from BlackBerry‚Äôs enterprise software business, we think a relatively nascent, quickly growing market will attract many new entrants. In a fragmented and rapidly evolving marketplace, we have greater confidence in larger, moat-endowed competitors like Microsoft and VMware to gain an outsize share of new business in the face of new competition, due to their ability to offer established and trusted endpoint protection software alongside endpoint management.

In the same segment, BlackBerry also sells its proprietary embedded software, QNX. Embedded software is the code that allows specific machines to do their jobs, and BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX software is sold primarily into the automotive market, as well as medical devices and industrial systems. BlackBerry partners with nearly every major automotive OEM and Tier 1 supplier for instrument clusters, driver-assistance systems, and infotainment, where it boasts market share a hair under 50%.

We see some moatworthy characteristics of the QNX automotive business but don‚Äôt think the switching costs are steep enough to award a moat. We liken QNX to moaty auto-parts suppliers in our coverage, with five- to seven-year model lifecycles ensuring a long contractual revenue stream, as BlackBerry incurs about 70% of contract value from car production volume throughout a model‚Äôs life. However, compared with the auto suppliers, most of QNX‚Äôs functions in the vehicle (primarily infotainment) are not mission-critical, though a proliferation of ADAS and autonomous vehicles may change this. Thus, BlackBerry must compete for every design win, even if it had sold into the prior model version. In infotainment specifically, as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto rise in popularity, automakers may find less reason to pay up for QNX in a new model over a free Linux alternative just to put the Apple or Android interface on top of it.

Finally, BlackBerry has a robust licensing segment where it monetizes its wealth of intellectual property. We think this business has moaty characteristics, given its contractual nature and the long average-weighted life of its patent portfolio. However, we believe the threat of value destruction here is too strong to give this category a narrow moat rating. BlackBerry doesn‚Äôt disclose the length or terminal dates of these contracts, and we don‚Äôt think the BlackBerry name is strong enough to elicit high retention rates for these licensing agreements. The business can also be mercurial, highlighted by the last BlackBerry-licensed smartphones by TCL ending sales in 2020.

Fair Value and Profit Drivers | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
Our fair value estimate of $6.40 per share implies a 2021 enterprise value/sales ratio of 3 times and a free cash flow yield of 5%.

We forecast compound annual revenue growth of 7% through fiscal 2030. We expect rapid growth for the firm‚Äôs Spark solution as it provides a stickier option to customers looking for comprehensive endpoint capabilities. We also expect strong growth for QNX as content gains with AVs of all levels offset market share losses to Android Automotive.

We think as BlackBerry becomes more seasoned as a software company, its gross margins will approach 80%. We expect operating margins to expand significantly over our 10-year explicit forecast, due in part to near-term synergies attained from a positive Cylance integration. Longer term, we expect revenue to rise at a faster pace than marketing spending, but for R&D expenses to stay elevated as the firm continually reinvests in innovation. We anticipate that BlackBerry will reach GAAP profitability by fiscal 2024 and reach operating margins in the 14% range by fiscal 2030.

Risk and Uncertainty | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
Given its tumultuous past and relative lack of operating history as a software company, we assign BlackBerry a very high fair value uncertainty rating. Since 2014, the firm has relied on M&A to pivot its business toward software. It encountered nine straight years of revenue decline, ending in 2020. BlackBerry‚Äôs ability to generate meaningful organic growth going forward will be paramount to its success.

BlackBerry‚Äôs future will also depend on its ability to integrate and expand upon prior acquisitions, specifically Cylance. As an endpoint protection platform, Cylance could bolster every other BlackBerry product by layering on advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. However, we have yet to see management drive organic growth out of this addition in its early days.

BlackBerry competes in highly fragmented and competitive markets, against some of the largest companies out there. It may be difficult for BlackBerry to maintain or steal market share from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and VMware with 10 or more times the revenue and R&D budget that it has. BlackBerry encounters the opposite problem with its QNX software, where it must compete with freely available Android and Linux operating systems. In these markets, it will need to continually innovate ahead of the competition to maintain pricing power, and thus market share, over these alternatives.

BlackBerry faces risk from being a relatively small and unproven new entrant into its key markets. Customers that are highly risk averse might opt to go with a more established competitor for an end-to-end solution, especially when money is tight. While in periods of economic growth, its name recognition might help to attract customers, in downturns, customers might steer clear of a name they associate with a sharp drop-off from a leadership position in the smartphone market in the early 2010s.

Capital Allocation | by William Kerwin Updated Nov 02, 2020
We assign BlackBerry a Standard stewardship rating. BlackBerry doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend or conduct share repurchases, choosing instead to allocate any excess capital to further inorganic growth.

CEO John Chen came into his role in 2014 in the middle of the company‚Äôs fall from the top of the smartphone world and led the firm‚Äôs pivot into software. As the firm‚Äôs handset sales experienced steep declines, he executed key acquisitions to help gain footholds in what are now BlackBerry‚Äôs primary markets. The $425 million acquisition of Good Technology in 2015 helped make BlackBerry‚Äôs existing mobile device management software platform-agnostic and catapulted the firm to a top-three share in the unified endpoint management market. In the years following, Chen tacked on a secure communication platform, Secusmart, and a secure crisis notification service, AtHoc. Most recently and significantly, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, planting one foot squarely into the endpoint protection market. We think the acquisitions under Chen‚Äôs tenure have expanded the firm‚Äôs product portfolio into high-growth markets and bode well for the future. While the firm‚Äôs revenue has been declining since 2011, its software and services revenue has been growing nicely, due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions.

We think Chen identified good M&A targets, but it is now time for him to prove he can generate organic growth out of them under the BlackBerry umbrella. Being known as a bit of a turnaround aficionado, Chen‚Äôs last charge was as chief executive of Sybase, a software and database company that he brought back into the black and sold at a 50% premium to SAP for $5.8 billion in 2010. We remain skeptical of BlackBerry‚Äôs luster as an M&A target, but at the very least the return to profitability appears to be underway.

Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it.

Honestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start.

Nevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer.

Mobileye

Don't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the ""tech of the future"" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:

Autonomous vehicles.

That's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030.

Don't take it from me ""The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. ""1\*

Mobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this.

Professor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, "" Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs.""

Intel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, ""We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.""

Fuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them.

Intel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say).

But Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up.

By buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount.

Like I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.

1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and buy Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.

Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.,11110,lj5oyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj5oyo/why_gamestop_and_ryan_cohen_will_win_dd_no/,1526,1613268544.0,"Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.

On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled ""Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers"". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.

**The Mission Statement**

""GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \[...\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.""

**The Landscape**

* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry
   * ""The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.""
   * ""The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.""
* Valuable Assets
   * Existing ""strong brand"" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.
   * ""Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.""
   * Large retail and physical footprint.

**The Roadmap**

* Evolve into a Technology-first company
   * ""Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.""
   * GameStop will have to ""begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers."" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)
   * GameStop will have to ""hire the right talent."" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).
* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform
   * ""Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors."" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)
   * Provide and expand ""larger gaming catalogs"" (Capture all games)
   * Create ""community experiences"" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)
   * Provide ""streaming services"" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)
   * Support ""Esports"" (Expanding scene that is not going away)
* Transition to Digital
   * ""Industry developments in recent years"" include ""transition from physical hardware to digital streaming"" and the ""explosion of mobile.""
   * Expand ""digital content."" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)
   * Allow ""online trade-ins."" (This would be a game changer)
* Cut Excessive costs
   * ""Cut its excessive real estate costs"" and ""identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.""
   * Streamline ""Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \[...\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.""
   * ""Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.""

**The Financials**

Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:

* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.

Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.

**The X Factor**

I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that ""RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability."" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.

Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon‚Äôs customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.

Furthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.

So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.

P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.

**------**

**I) The Short Interest Numbers**

Short interest (""SI"") is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)*;* [*https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp)*.* Apparently other firms have used different versions of float. All other forms of float are likely incorrect, and not likely used by Finra. **This is an important assumption** \- if I am wrong here, then fuck.

**Edit** (to above): People are suggesting my float is wrong. That is exactly my point. I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is. If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA, post it; this post is then useless. The math working backwards from 226% is fair game, however. That's why it's possible I'm wrong (*see* [*https://www.highshortinterest.com/*](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)*)*. *See also* comment by [JeanGuyRubberboots](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanGuyRubberboots/) below (ctrl+f). *Either way, it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock.* I want to see the actual float used by FINRA. Until then, here's the math based on the SI equation.

Total outstanding shares of GME is 69.75 million. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/).

Finra SI of GME is .78 as of January 27th. *See* [*http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0*](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0).

.78\*69.75 million = 54.405m. Thus, 54.045m million shares are short GME of January 27th.

To calculate real SI, we remove insider ownership. **Another big assumption**. Insider ownership stands at 19.06m. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/).

Thus, free float is outstanding shares *less* insider ownership shares. 50,750,000 shares.

**Real SI appears, at minimum, 1.07 (54.405m/50.750m).**

**II) The Shorts Remaining and Covered**

On January 15th, GME SI stood at 121%. *See* [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31).

Thus, from January 15th to the 27th, we know at least 84.397m shares were shorted. (1.21\*outstanding shares).

By January 27th, 54.405m shorts remained (previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1.27). The number of shorts that covered from Jan. 15th to the 27th was was 29.992m. 29.992m/84.397m shares = \~35%. Thus, 65% of shorts pre-squeeze remain, owing APR.

Around \~35% of covering resulted in a 1,600% rise. Thus, a 65% cover rate (conservative) can yield a 2,971% rise. Let‚Äôs apply this math to now. From $50, this is a $1,485.50 GME price result. Could this happen? No idea. Notice the problem with this: I'm assuming *only* covering led to this rise. So this is simply a demonstrative point.

**New shorts from Jan. 27th to present likely opened at higher prices. 65% of those from $5, $10, $20, etc., probably remain. This is bad news for HF's.**

**III) The Effect**

Based on estimated remaining covers, price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls. This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM. This part is unclear. We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak--- what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze. In my opinion, it wasn't until drops below <$200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts. This is a substantial point: if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought, then the pain points for HF's are far lower. It's just unclear. Nonetheless, HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts.

A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions. *See* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). You'd think these are correlated markets, so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates. Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted. Or because there is no volume on the stock. I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions, but I imagine they're higher. I don't know more beyond this. Feel free to debate.

Moreover, consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME. It appears that retail buying power is spent. People either cashed out or are holding. So, they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze - or a gamma one for that matter. Thus, the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional. Not all hedge funds are short $GME - nor are all financial whales. In my view, this has become an institutional fight, with both sides pointing the gun at each other, waiting who's going to pull the trigger first. Retail is simply on the sidelines, holding the clips in for both their guns (smirking, of course). How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure? Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it. My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart, they can't be fooled twice, etc., and all of that non-sense. But before intelligence comes greed. And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system.

**IV) Parting Thoughts**

It would take a half-brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers. Yet Finra was late (posted after hours I think). This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers - yet, again, **dead silence** from the mainstream media. Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI, as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests. Americans with $2,000\* in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud (that is, the general public and the focus doesn‚Äôt appear to be on hedge funds) and not the Big Money that loop-hole-engineered an illegal 140% naked short situation. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/); *see also* [http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/](http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/).

The Big Short is illustrative. It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions. Put differently, fraud doesn't just pervade the system - nay, it ***is*** the system. Everything I've seen *just doesn't feel right*. Understand at this point I'm speculating. But I trust my gut.

There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME. This is beyond my knowledge span. However, if you looked at the bid-ask spreads this week of $GME, they were at times pennies apart for days. I've never seen that before. Seriously, **what the fuck.**

DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capital. Next Thursday is a day to watch for me. Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America - and, arguably, the globe. Americans *and the world* will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50-90%. For many, their life savings. No, it wasn't a result of imprudent investments -- to invest money into a squeezing stock is a *good* idea short-term. It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because *the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money. So when the risk of you getting that rich increased, they stopped the game (pun intended)*. We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion - that's just speculation, and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is. But think of how this plays out: these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it. Or they tell you the truth that, based on risk management and capital models, they never thought retail would get that rich that fast. Either way, I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television. A key element to the public's reaction: AOC grilling the hell out of these folks. That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching.

And to set the record straight, I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands -- middle America is holding because *they have nothing to lose* after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half. **So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired.** In the process of stunting buying pressure, they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders. Poetic justice - and fucking hilarious.

I'm not demonizing rich people. We all want financial freedom. I'm demonizing cheating the game. However this ends one thing is clear: The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie.

**TLDR: it's in the damn title.**

INTC is fundamentally undervalued. Short term Tendies are possible,105,lj59h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj59h8/intc_is_fundamentally_undervalued_short_term/,163,1613267301.0,"# Let's get some facts down

Intel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.

Just on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.

# Data Analysis

|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|
|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|
|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|

As someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?

if intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a 500 billion market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).

I currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.

"Notes about BB, Cylance, Amazon, Kuiper, antennas, and why I'm 1000% okay with buying BB at $20.",618,lj544a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj544a/notes_about_bb_cylance_amazon_kuiper_antennas_and/,121,1613266853.0,"A note about Cylance before I jump into the rest.

The concept of the original Cylance product is absolutely excellent...behavioral (not AV definition) protection against viruses. Frankly, it's the way it should have always been done. You don't need to know the name of the guy punching you in the face, you just need to prevent getting punched. However, their implementation and service was garbage. I'm saying this as someone who implemented it extensively in a large enterprise environment. BB buying Cylance was a good move, IF they can build it and support it better. However, as potentially disruptive as it could be, a rebuild has to happen fast or there will be better competition with the same philosophy very soon and that opportunity will be lost.

Unless...it's not a play for the PC and server protection market at all. If you think about it in terms of their other product offerings, it makes sense. Automotive operating systems are a massive and incredibly dangerous target, both in the frame of making sure a terrorist doesn't use your vehicle to kill you or others, and in the protection of mobile retail for the people sitting in their self-driving cars and shopping on the way to work.

Behavioral protection makes absolute sense there, as there will definitely be ties between the car itself and what you do in it. The car's sanctity must be protected at all costs. So, look to BB be integrating this protection philosophy into it's automotive efforts.

...

Now, on a very related topic.  

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/

BB has teamed up with Amazon...

> The two tech companies will co-develop and market BlackBerry IVY, a new ""cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform"" that offers automakers a ""standardized secure way to read and analyze vehicle sensor data."" IVY will merge BlackBerry's QNX embedded OS for vehicles with AWS' IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning services.

And Amazon is getting into the satellite-mesh internet business as a competitor to Musk's SpaceX Starlink.

https://www.pcmag.com/news/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype

And Amazon has bought Zoox to get into self-driving cars: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/amazon-buys-self-driving-technology-company-zoox.html

Amazon is big into antenna development: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development

> Rajeev Badyal, VP of Technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon. ‚ÄúThis simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It‚Äôs incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.‚Äù

Let's think about we've got existing or in development...

* A secure operating system (QNX)
* A system of sensors to read it (IVY)
* Cars that use the OS and provide the sensors (175 million using QNX now, will only grow)
* A system to protect the cars (Cylance or whatever is built from it)
* A massive retail company (Amazon)
* Mobile internet worldwide (Amazon's Project Kuiper)
* Cars that will use that mobile internet (phased array antenna)
* Self-driving cars (Zoox purchase)

Resulting in: A bored and captive audience of consumers, sitting in their self-driving cars, insulated from the world, protected from the bad folks, spending their cash and surfing behind tinted windows. Amazon making a ton of cash. Blackberry receiving some of that on multiple fronts.

I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just satisfied that I bought BB at $20, and will be buying more over time, maybe at a lower price but definitely at a higher one.

*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*

Congrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. 

The PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. 

**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. 

I am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it‚Äôs clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. 

I am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. 

Stay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY üò≠ 

**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**

The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. 

For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. 

Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues.

When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion. 

**Correct** on the sector rotation into DOW/cyclicals. M hit decently, CCL smashed and saved my portfolio today with +9%

**Incorrect**:IV wasn‚Äôt enough to save a very shit day from FSLY‚Äî the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn‚Äôt help. 

**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong. 
EDIT: monster AH movement from FUBO

**How I moved** trimmed FSLY and FUBO but clutching still, and opened a big position in PSTH in the morning still holding. Holding CCL and M too.

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I‚Äôm going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I‚Äôll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) üöÄ üò≠ 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I‚Äôll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)


[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ 

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**üöó üöÄ 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

[FUBO 2/26 42c and 2/19 56c](https://i.imgur.com/blCr0q3.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ 

**EDIT: shoutout to /u/4p0rn0nly who pointed on that the 55c has a more favorable bid/ask spread and vol/OI. This is why I keep that inbox open!**

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

**Fellow Bulls beware:** üêª 

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve‚Äôs%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**: 

Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.

The other 2 companies have electric trucks in the running but Oshkosh has one with a diesel motor in it.  From what I‚Äôve read more than one company may be chosen so I‚Äôm banking that they will go with an electric and gas option, which means Oshkosh would be chosen having the only combustion engine offered. There are lots of rural areas across the country where electric wouldn‚Äôt be the best option. Also, the fact that Oshkosh already has contracts with the US Government making specialty trucks and military vehicles, seems to be an added benefit. 

USPS is scheduled to make an announcement in the first quarter of this year and long calls on $OSK are still fairly cheap. Just wondering what others think about what appears to be a golden opportunity?

Long ass DD on why being long on Macerich will make you rich,136,lj3xy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj3xy8/long_ass_dd_on_why_being_long_on_macerich_will/,81,1613263311.0,"## Introduction

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers (you know, that thing that you don't go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic).

The company has performed very poorly company wise (occupancy dropped to 89.8% in 2020 from 95.4% in 2018) and in stock price (it dropped from $90 in July 2016 to $6 in April 2020 and is now at $12.90).

There are a few worrying things about this company. So let's go through them one by one and see how bad they are.

## Their debt

They've increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don't go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don't really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.

To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it's needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They've also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.

## Occupancy / Rent collection 

Their occupancy is at 89.7	% (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.

The good news however is that ""*rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.*"" said Tom O'Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.


## The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general

That's a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as [this Vox article shows very well](https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts).

But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that's pretty good for them.

## What about the bankrupt stores in the near future

Green Street Advisors expects ""about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021.""

That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They're planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :

> However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that's why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that's why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that's what they're becoming. They're transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that's what our modern-day shopper wants.

What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.

## The repurpose of their buildings 

That's great to know that they're *planning* on ""bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses"" but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?

First, let's see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :

- Offices but there's a lot of uncertainty in this area. We're in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.
- Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.
- Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. 
- Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.

Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. 

> It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.

Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let's evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they've invested in. 

**California**

Let's start with California and use [the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast](https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html). They've polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :

They're pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they're confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, ""*the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space*"". Outch! Right in the feels!

Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : ""*62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months*"".

Also :

> Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.

However, for the industrial space market, they're really optimistic : ""*approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.*"".

They're also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.

So I'm pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.

And how about Ney York??

**New York**

Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!

In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that [Office sales have dropped 58%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/) and [retail sales activity dropped 78%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/) during the lockdown.

[Also](https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/) :

> Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.

Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it's the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it's a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they're no longer trapped in the city and [110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result](https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/).

So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) *in the short term*.

For the long term, long story short, that's going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.

**An the rest of the commercial real estate though?**

There's [a nice report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html) by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.

## Conclusion

Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It's pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they're mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in.",2021-02-14 02:41:51

$UBS lazy Saturday morning half-ass DD,27,lj3d34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj3d34/ubs_lazy_saturday_morning_halfass_dd/,30,1613261505.0,"UBS is trading at an extremely discounted rate.  Not sure how long this will continue but they‚Äôre only trading around 8.5x...here‚Äôs a competitors list and what value they‚Äôre trading at:

WFC over 80x

C around 12.5x

TFC is 17.5x

USB is 15.5x

PNC is 9.5x

COF is 23x

Ignoring the outlier of WFC...our median is around 15.5x

If UBS gets priced at 15.5x we get an increase in share value from $15.40 to $28.  This is an 82% increase.  I think this will happen thru actions of UBS themselves because they‚Äôve initiated a 3yr stock buyback program, valued at $4.5 Billion and they plan to buyback $1.1 Billion in the first quarter.  The total buyback would reduce the amount of outstanding shares by around 300M.  Thus increasing the share price to around $18.33 at current price to earning.

However by reducing the amount of outstanding shares...it will significantly reduce dividend expense, and exponentially increase institutional value (while also lining the pockets of the execs including the new CEO - Ralph Hamers). Rumor is the new CEO was brought in to bring UBS into the digital future.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

> # Trading After Presidents‚Äô Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents‚Äô Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of ‚Äì0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of ‚Äì0.49% and a median loss of ‚Äì0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents‚Äô Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of ‚Äì0.07% and a median decline of ‚Äì0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average ‚Äì0.02%, median ‚Äì0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average ‚Äì0.01%, median ‚Äì0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs‚Äîit is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here‚Äôs hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three‚ÄînCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)‚Äînow have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/wallstreetbets.",2021-02-14 01:27:19
Let's talk about LoanDepot (LDi) and it's potential upside movement in the next few weeks.,0,lj1zmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj1zmo/lets_talk_about_loandepot_ldi_and_its_potential/,41,1613257081.0,"Alright guys, I know you are all busy trying to find the next meme stock to make everyone lose money, but I think LDi is a legit GROWTH company that's going to at least double over the next month. 

&#x200B;

# What is LoanDepot?

Loan Depot is the second largest nonbank Mortgage Originator in the united states. Having gone public in just the last few days. It's taken a similar approach that other mortgage originator IPOs have gone in the last few years, [a severely underpriced IPO](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loandepot-raises-just-54m-in-downsized-ipo/) LDi isnt too far behind Rocket Mortgage, arguably the #1 in the space right now. LDI has a 3 billion dollar market cap, **compared to Rocket's 40 billion dollar market cap.** Even though LDI is more storefront focused and RKT is dominant with their online presence and super bowl ads, if these companies are even in the same universe, **there is still massive upside for LDI.** Sure, we have to take into consideration that Rocket absolutely dumped right after it's IPO after an initial pop, but the company was already fully valued. LDI is not. I'm setting a $100 price target after a few months. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Another interesting catalyst

&#x200B;

Loan depot is about to have an earnings call on the [18th of this month](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loandepot-inc-report-fourth-quarter-130000039.html). It's my understanding that they don't even need to do this as they have just gone public. This could be a huge announcement, or some forward looking statements/guidance that they are releasing to burn the underwriters who severely underpriced their company and left them with just 54 million in cash after years of trying to go public. Mortgage originations are at multi year highs, and interest rates are dirt cheap, so im not thinking that this is a multi-year growth stock, however a hold for a few months might have a huge payoff. In the end, make your own decision but I really think this one is a no brainer. What do you guys think?

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I've got shares, i'm holding them till LDI hits 100-150

&#x200B;

I am not an FA, this isnt financial advice, and i'm holding shares purchased in the 20's.",2021-02-14 00:58:01
DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance. Buy the dip,138,lj1vhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj1vhs/dd_cloudflare_net_is_going_to_continue_its_strong/,101,1613256673.0,"Alright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...¬†¬†you‚Äôre going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter‚Äù

Seriously, this is cool, and it‚Äôs only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what‚Äôs going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

>Over the coming months, we‚Äôll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It‚Äôll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we‚Äôll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won‚Äôt just be your frontend, it‚Äôll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare‚Äôs network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they‚Äôll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you‚Äôre not a developer, you probably didn‚Äôt understand most of that, but essentially, they‚Äôre making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it‚Äôs profitability... üöÄüöÄüöÄ

(And even if it doesn‚Äôt, and stays at 50%, it will still üöÄ but slower. Regardless, it‚Äôs going up)

\---

‚ÄúBuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs‚Äù

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren‚Äôt long. Plus it‚Äôs hardly a tank when it‚Äôs at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven‚Äôt read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock‚Äôs immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that‚Äôs $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn‚Äôt the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they‚Äôre going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn‚Äôt profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they‚Äôve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn‚Äôt stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here‚Äôs why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‚Äò22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare‚Äôs network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

‚Äî-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I‚Äôm a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there‚Äôs no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don‚Äôt matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Better Internet‚Äù shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare‚Äôs already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren‚Äôt in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I‚Äôm trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I‚Äôve been playing NET since 37. It‚Äôs a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn‚Äôt done its 30% move. I‚Äôm completely assured that it will soon",2021-02-14 00:51:13
COTY dd - Makeup Never Dies,86,lj1asm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj1asm/coty_dd_makeup_never_dies/,67,1613254570.0,"Below is my DD on why COTY will be comeback play that combines new growth and returning revenues post-covid.

**What is COTY?** Coty is the makeup/cosmetics king. With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018. These brands include: Covergirl, Burberry, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Boss, Chloe ETC. You can google the rest if you are curious.

**Why are they beaten down?** One major reason: With the pandemic, a lot of girls have adopted work from home/stay home lifestyles. Basically, alot of girls are too lazy and don't find the necessity to put on any makeup or perfume if they are just sitting at home with their sweatpants on. 

**Recovery/Online Growth**: Makeup/skincare isn't going anywhere, this isn't a dying industry. Also this has jump started COTY's e-commerce sales though their retail sales were hurting. According to their recent 4Q earnings call they are reporting that their percentage of net revenue through e-commerce has DOUBLED from pre-covid. As they invest in their e-commerce and online sales partnerships I can see this growing into a cosmetics/skincare version of Chewy. 

**Asian Expansion**: They are investing heavily in the Asian market and are seeing huge revenue gains from their previous investment. China is a huge market for cosmetics, especially premium skincare brands. Trust me, from dating alot of asian girls, they use makeup and skincare like its CRACK. They are addicted to the stuff. According to the CEO they have seen a whopping 40% Year Over Year increase in their prestige brand skincare retail sales in China. Considering again the lockdown environment this would probably be magnitudes higher if it were a non-pandemic year. Another sign of huge potential in Asia, is their Gucci skincare brand partnership with a Chinese Influencer had over 100million digital convos, the amount of skincare addicts in asia is insane and COTY will be making bank.

**New Leadership** - Sue Nabi new CEO, appointed July 2020, is a growth innovator in the beuty industry. Before joining COTY she oversaw double digit growth 4 years in a row in both Loreal Paris and Lancome. She also launched a booming green new-age skincare brand back in 2014. She is exactly what COTY needs, a younger smarter visionary CEO with the guts and experience to turn this retail focused blob into a online growth juggernaut.

**Price predictions**: I believe by eoy COTY will be back to 15 just as a recovery play. As they further expand their asian and online presense I could see them getting valued more as a growth play over the next 2 years. Growth price target: 50+
