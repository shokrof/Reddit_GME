Inspirational Copypasta for Bagholders,0,lkks70,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkks70/inspirational_copypasta_for_bagholders/,13,1613445453.0,"""Real r/Wallstreetbets” only consists of the GME scene and the late 340 💎 🙌 scene. What is known by ""Bagholders"" is nothing but 💎 🙌 with questionable real market influence. When people try to argue that stocks like GME won’t moon 🚀 , while saying that TRLY will, I can't help not to cringe because they are just as fake wsb as 🧻 🙌 (plus the pretentiousness). Real wsb sounds ENERGETIC, POWERFUL and somewhat HATEFUL. Fake squeezes are weak, self pity and a failed attempt to direct energy and stonks to the moon. Some examples of REAL SQUEEZES are GME, AMC, BB (the only real long game from the wsb scene) and NOK. Some examples of FAKE SQUEEZES are TRLY, APHA and TSLA GME BELONGS TO DIAMOND HANDS NOT TO PAPER HANDS, 🌈 🐻 s, MELVIN OR ANY OTHER HEDGIES

The 10 bagger that has been in front of you all along,704,lkgfjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgfjt/the_10_bagger_that_has_been_in_front_of_you_all/,338,1613433386.0,"If you are wondering why the markets closed today, beats me I have no fucking idea. I've decided to take the time to dig into $PLTR with all this unemployment freetime. Im sure most of you retards have seen plenty of DD on $PLTR but I would like to highlight some things I felt were important and give you that sweet sweet confirmation bias you all love. Digging through some documents got my dick so hard and raw from me jerking off like a frantic autistic maniac that I had to apply a coat of lotion so my cock could heal.

You retards have no idea just how big this fucking company could be in 2-3 years. I will be splitting this DD into multiple parts so put on your glasses and helmets and buckle up. Disclaimer: I no longer need glasses because daddy Cohen paid for my lasik. Soon to be Dadio Karp will be paying for a new house, new wife and cybertruck.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Part 1) Contracts contracts contracts...*

Do you realize how many fucking contracts this fucking company is signing? Don't even get me started on the renewals.

I'll list a few just to get things started. (This is within a 4 month timeframe, yes 4 months you monkeys)

October 1st, 2020: U.S. Army Research Lab Selects Palantir Technologies Inc. for $91M Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Development

October 2nd, 2020: Palantir Technologies bags $36M IDIQ contract

October 22, 2020: Palantir providing U.S. government with coronavirus tracking software. estimate: $5M

November 18th, 2020 new U.S. Army contract. estimate: $5M

December 7th, 2020: New FDA contract. The contract, to power drug review and inspections, is worth $44.4M, Bloomberg says.

December 21st, 2020: Palantir receives $114M one-year option for U.S. Army's Vantage program.

December 23rd, 2020: Palantir inks 2-year contract for U.K. health services work worth $31.5M

Autists, this is 8 contracts in 4 months worth over 300 million dollars.

I know it's amazing, wipe that drool off your face. This company is in its infancy stage, the little retard can barely walk.

Here is a nice little snippet from an oil and gas company that recently partnered with Palantir:

""An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform"".

**WITHIN WEEKS THIS COMPANY SAVED 57 MILLION USING PALANTIR. Fuck my ass and call Papa Karp Daddy.**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Part 2) Across the great blue ocean*

Palantir hasn't even touched the untapped money pit that is foreign countries.

I'm not going into to much detail but take notice all of the contracts thus far have been with companies within America. In one of Karp's interviews he was asked If foreign countries would have access to the the software, his reply ""If you are allied with america it is an easy process""

When I heard that red flags went off and im sure your retarded brain is wondering why are red flags going off Mr. [r/wallstreetboys](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetboys/)? Well little retard the software is so fucking advanced that if it falls into the wrong hands it could have devastating impacts. ""DING DING DING"" THIS COMPANIES SOFTWARE IS THE EQUIVALENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS KARP SAID. Jesus fucking christ do I have to say it again you smooth brained fuck.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part *3) The Moat*

Don't even say snowflake in the comments you retards. $PLTR has no fucking competitors, it is years ahead of any other company thinking about joining the club.

And guess what retard? When a company becomes dependent on a software they keep renewing their contracts. BY THE TIME ANY OTHER COMPANY COMES CLOSE TO PALANTIR THEY WILLHAVE LOCKED IN SO MANY CONTRACTS THAT THERE WILL BE ONLY BREAD CRUMBS LEFT FOR COMPETITORS.

TLDR: Papa Karp can gladly join my wifes boyfriend and I for an **orgy**.

EDIT: Lockup and earnings this week, if you don't feel comfortable with a lot of volatility don't touch this stock for a while.

EDIT 2: If you wan't the bear thesis do your own DD. It has several but I personally see the positives outweighing the negative's longterm. If you think this is a 10 bagger in the next week, it's not. I plan to hold for years.

$THO. Over or under valued?,7,lkwq20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkwq20/tho_over_or_under_valued/,14,1613481701.0,"Like many people I bought a travel trailer last fall just so I could go do SOMETHING!  I got mine used so the rest doesn't pertain to me..

Many of my friends also decided to buy trailers...you can't find them!  There is literally a waiting list for these things at dealers.  Those that did get one can't find a park that has seasonal rentals, and most weekly sites are already booked..They are sold out...in February.  This is very unusual.  If you don't believe it check for yourself.  Check your local rv dealer and popular camping  sites.

This makes me think that even though $THO has had a phenomenal year, it's not over.  Thor is the big guy in this industry.  If they can't keep up who can?   I think short term it's a no brainier.  This could also play into autos since you can't haul a 10,000lb trailer with your wife's boyfriends  93 Yougo.  

That said, $THO has had a huge run since March, and has been hovering in the 120s.  I'm wondering  if it's at its peak or could  go higher once we thaw out and it stops raining.

\- Balance Sheet, strong AF sitting on $1B in cash

ESG:

\- Will compete with multiple established EV carmakers like Tesla and Lucid, but also pair well with companies and consumers who want to have an affordable EV SUV like the Fisker Ocean

Recent Hype/Momentum:

\- Morgan Stanley increased their PT to $27

Even if 98% of these 9M subs weren't broke AF with $50 in their Robinhood accounts, and each person invested $1000, that would only be 9 billion dollars of purchasing power.

9 billion dollars is PEANUTS for hedge funds. A single hedge fund or investment group can move 9 billion in a day, can you imagine what thousands of hedge funds around the globe can do?

There are INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS with more investing power/cash than all of WSB combined. This is not /biz/, this is not basement NEETS shilling shitcoins, this is big boy land with big boy people in suits in Manhattan skyscrapers and high class polish escorts going for 5k/hour. This is entire trading floors made up of Wharton MBA grads who come from old money, and most of you are just freshmen in the Derek Zoolander School of Options Trading, so shut the fuck up.

What we have going on here is .01% of WSB people are actually not completely retarded, and they SHARE their good DD with us which gives us the OPPORTUNITY to buy and make some money off hedge fund wars and hedge fund plays.

Learn some fucking humility and be grateful you made money off a dumb fucking purple mattress store or something equally stupid. You are literally a retarded ape if you think WSB can ""fight hedge funds"" or some dumb shit like that. 75% of you don't even know how to read.

Due Diligence on Burford Capital,0,ll4150,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll4150/due_diligence_on_burford_capital/,39,1613511769.0,"**Due Diligence on BUR - Burford Capital - Litigation Finance**

Litigation  financing is an asset class that few have talked about here. It is,  however, very lucrative. Returns are lumpy but significant. The business  model is rather simple. Find someone with a claim, that (a) has little  money or is (b) risk averse. Have smart lawyers look at the case details  and evaluate the chances of winning the case (due diligence). If you  think you can win: offer to pay for his lawyers and costs. In return get  a share of the profits (usually 30% or more) if you win. Burford  Capital is the biggest player in this game.

I  believe BUR is significantly undervalued. I put my money where my mouth  is and have invested >100k. I will diamond hand this to USD 100+.

BUR  has been attacked by the Short Seller Muddy Waters in 2019. Using phony  made up scare tactics and the now well known ladder attacks, this has  tanked the shareprice. Following the attack, one of the bigger investors  in BUR (Neil Woodford) was forced to sell, further killing the sp.  However, the company has completely [refuted](https://www.burfordcapital.com/media-room/media-room-container/response-to-short-attack/)  the allegations and has brilliant prospects. I consider the risks to be  limited, especially since BUR has been deeply scrutenized before their  dual listing in the US in 2020.

While  the stock price has recovered a great deal, it is far from its all time  high of GBP 20 (=23 USD), currently trading at 9 USD. I think it can  reach its all time high quickly and go far beyond that. With Brexit and  Covid disrupting the economy, new legal cases will arise. This should  lead to an expanding client demand.

Hard  facts: P/E > 13; Price to Book: 1.06. Which is ridiculous based on a  cumulative historic ROIC of 88% (!). Those returns are completely  uncorrelated to the overall market (courts decide independent of  economy). The business model is hard to copy, as you need years of  market activity to convince lawyers that you are reliable. So there are  significant barriers to entry.

The  company has currently USD 820 million USD deployed in ongoing assets.  This is deployed in a large and diversified portfolio, the largest in  the industry, having many cases helps mitigating the risks of losing any  one case. It does not prevent you from losing cases, but on average,  you will win more cases than you lose.

There are realistic possibilities for an amazing ROI.

\-  The Peterson Case alone (that was already profitable for BUR bought at  20 million and already sold stakes in the case for 236 million,  retaining 61.25% of its original entitlement) has now entered a late  stage of the proceeding with the judge in NY being quite sympathetic to  BURs claim. That claim could be up to 13 billion, 61% of which would be 8  bn (6x the market cap). Anyone should invest on these grounds alone. I  have taken this bet, I believe that BUR has a > 50% chance of  winning.

\- VW and Trucks Cartel Cases have the potential of yielding USD 1.2 bn on a USD 30 million investment.

This  is quite legendary, especially knowing that all the other cases of BUR  (see graph attached) tend to win big. I think we have a winner here. The  Lit-Financing asset class is not well known, so investors should have a  great potential before the mainstream storms in.

I  think price to book should be at least 3. I can see the book value land  on USD 10 billion on invested capital. Market cap should be USD 30 bn.  219 million shares. Fair value USD 136 per share.

This is my personal opinion and not financial advice.

TL;DR: BUR should be worth USD 30 billion+.

"Miners and the Global Commodity Supercycle ft. VALE, FCX, MT",217,ll3wl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll3wl2/miners_and_the_global_commodity_supercycle_ft/,90,1613511333.0,"**Preface** 

* For whatever its worth, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/).

**I. Introduction**

* The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*

* If you’ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China’s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years. 

* I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.

**II. Coronavirus & Government Intervention**

* The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies – **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** – to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration. 

* The impact wasn’t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers – expecting lower demand – [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension. 

* Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).

**III. Industrial Demand**

* Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government’s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.

* For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil & Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets. Renewable investments have been highly profitable with [studies stating](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/05/28/just-how-good-an-investment-is-renewable-energy-new-study-reveals-all/?sh=7b9d17194d27) that renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments. [The International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/financeinvestment/Investment-Needs#:~:text=In%20its%20latest%20analysis%2C%20Global,in%20the%202016%2D2050%20period) stated the world would require an additional $27T in infrastructure spending from 2016-2050 fulfill the objects of the Paris Agreement. Annual renewable investments in 2018 would have needed to [double](https://i.imgur.com/aKqAwSh.png) to be on track to meet targets and **[Goldman Sachs believes that the capital expenditure cycle could rival the 2000s](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM).** 

* China has announced they expect [higher steel demand](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-steel-idUSL1N2K204Z) vs last year. [Economists now see US-China GDP parity in 2028 from 2033](https://i.imgur.com/OOkc7mO.png). Both the US and China are looking to upset one another and it’s hard to see demand slacking with [two world powers competing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245) to achieve faster greenification and out-GDP the other. Note that [India](https://i.imgur.com/coaL6YG.png) joined the infrastructure bandwagon last year and continued to emphasize infrastructure in their [latest budget](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/india-budget-health-care-infrastructure-and-fiscal-deficit.html). Countries have begun to launch major projects to meet their targets or as a tool to generate economic activity. [South Korea](https://www.power-technology.com/news/south-korea-plans-build-43bn-offshore-wind-farm/). [Scotland](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d4355db2-3036-4450-b2a0-611a56d944bf). [EU](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568). [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-transit-fund-1.5908346). [Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).

* Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward. [These guys will probably need more metals too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market).

* Global construction is looking at a [record growth](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2021/02/global-market-scan-2021-a-year-of-recovery-and-reacceleration-in-global-construction) for the year. Additionally, expanding the sector is a way for governments to have an immediate effect on [employment](https://i.imgur.com/JnbiYUS.png) and thus the economy. [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/infrastructure-stimulus-in-covid-pandemic-recovery-and-beyond)

* Lastly, the most recent [ISM](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202102pmi.pdf) manufacturing index has continued to point towards growth with low inventory, high backlog, and overall bullish outlook on economic activity.  [Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png) 

**IV. Financial Demand**

* The government’s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.

* Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.

* PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html) 

**V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines** 

* The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges. 

* All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government’s upcoming spending agenda. The markets – on near zero interest rates – are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).

* Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining’s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.

**VI. Conclusion**

* The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.

* Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden’s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.

Why Shell (RDSA) is undervalued,119,ll3sq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll3sq2/why_shell_rdsa_is_undervalued/,79,1613510971.0,"First of all, yes this is a boomer stock but I like money.

So you're probably wondering why I'm writing about this stock and why it is undervalued right now (in my opinion). Let me point out the following things:

First of all, Brent oil is at a 12-month high and will even go higher ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html)). The supply shrinks but the demand grows, refineries are closing due the cold weather (aka we're turning up the heat to keep ourselves warm). Shell has a break even price at $31, so with the current Brent price ($63) they are making $32 per barrel!!!

Secondly, there is still a lot of air traffic ([https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity)) and once the pandemic is over, there will be even more commercial flights.

Shell is producing synthetic kerosene!!! This is a huge one, I'm surprised that this isn't getting more attention ([https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article](https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article)). Shell is focusing on their emission neutral transition, they have a bright future ([https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN))

Lastly, Shell also sells natural gas, which is also peaking ([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html)).

Bonus: 18th February is the ex-dividend date aka if you have shares at opening, you get a dividend.

So why is Shell's stock price so low? Negative sentiment, completely retarded people thought that they will go bankrupt because of the pandemic. Others are saying that we won't need oil and that green energy is sufficient... delusional lmao.

The real reasonable reason: the dividend cut they have done, this helps them to pay off their debt. BUT they will raise every quarter the dividend with 4% (or more). There is a big possibility of a share buy back when their debt goes below 65 billion, which might be very soon with these insanely growing oil prices.

TLDR: Oil up, Shell up

Undervalued, low risk, good reward.

Playing The Market Fvckery... Pt. 3... playing the etf game for gee eeemeeeeeee,2224,ll26ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll26ij/playing_the_market_fvckery_pt_3_playing_the_etf/,265,1613504830.0,"This one is very theoretical. If you don't know what Im talking about please research this or reread this.

Okay, we know the heavily shorted stock mentioned came off the Threshold list on Feb 3rd. That means they covered almost all of their FTD's (faild to deliver). Many of these were bought in the open market at high prices, however many people have speculated that it doesn't seem to be enough. The market Volume was very low and the sellers to buyers ratio was also very low. could that be enough? They were on the threshold list for 39 days straight and they covered it all in just a few days? Maybe. But what if it wasn't enough? Where did they get the rest of the shares they needed? Remember, if they don't deliver in 13 days after the 3 day settlement period is up, then they lose the right to short sell forever. That is why they have to buy at the higher prices and that is the main reason, along with the hype, that the stock price spiked. 

Now lets introduce another player into the game called the etfs.  There are several ETF's that have the geemee stock as part of their portfolio. I have only looked at one. you can  check out the other ones  too. Apparently there are 79 ETF's which hold the stock.  I checked out ex are tee. Their chart looks very similar to the chart of  the stock mentioned And it is one of their main stocks that make up part of their fund. Maybe Coincidence? 

Now, the etf went ON the threshold list on January  29th and has remained there to this very day! IT did not appear on the securities threshold list a single day this year before jan 29th That is the same day that the the short sellers supposedly covered most of their short positions and the geemee spike started to drop as well as about the same time the brokers stopped letting people trade!  This etf currently sits at 190% short float. Peaking on 2/1 at over 800% short float!  As of 11feb2021, they also only hold 454,595 shares(3.36% of the fund) of the mentiopned stock, coming down from a high of roughly 19%.

 

[outstanding shares of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/fcfu9kpisth61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5484039e4707243d234da8a633f8f5c3af844e1)

&#x200B;

[Shares shorted of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/b6aalo74sth61.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c590c3113485e44c1839fe748be0918f582c17)

 There is a possibility that  the ETF's that had shares of geemeee were used to cover the failed short positions so that it would come off the threshold list. This would create the image that the opportunity is over, however then  the ETF's involved would be now in the exact same position that the stock was in just before the spike. This would  just move the crisis from one place to another. 

This procedure can be mainly done by naked shorting the stock.  If a manager wants to short a single stock, but they don't want to go to the extent of borrowing and disclosing the short, they would short an ETF that holds the stock, and simultaneously buy long the underlying holdings that they don't want to short. This Naked shorting ETFs is generally acceptable due to arbitrage, but if one goes long on the remainder of the holdings (not many in the mentioned etf), one can naked short the stock without doing any arbitrage on the ETF. This, when coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes the heavily shorted stock off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be, and provides the ability to naked short the stock again.

&#x200B;

[Comparison of the ETF short positions and the underlying stock](https://preview.redd.it/hrg8gx2lrth61.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=01cba928637efebe0e584c2796ea04e46bd52056)

 This is a likely scenario how geemeee could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive the stock down outside of buying puts. Theres list of etfs holding this stock. They can all be used in the same way. Thats a theory right now. All figures indicated that the % of shorts went down without any real price movement that should have reflected this. This would be the explanation.

For all the retards rubbing their hands now: It's very unlikely to squeeze an ETF because managers will just buy more shares of the underlying and issue more shares of the ETF. They don't need shareholder approval or prior announcement to issue new shares as do single companies. And other banks and funds can buy shares of the underlying and create more shares of the ETF themselves as APs. 

 I am not a professional.. I am not advocating any action on the part of anyone else when it comes to buying, selling, or holding stocks. I didn't mention any ticker. You should also not mention any ticker in the comments. You are responsible for your own actions in the stock market. 

Let's see what will happen in part 4.",2021-02-16 21:47:10

Why TLRY is still a great move,277,ll1gr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll1gr1/why_tlry_is_still_a_great_move/,130,1613501777.0,"Disclaimer: I've been in **$TLRY** since $11 so I might be biased but have been trading weeklies / holding leaps since I flipped the first weekly profits. Price popped to $60+ mid last week and is sitting back around $30 now. There's a couple reasons I'm not selling until later:

&#x200B;

**Earnings tomorrow.** February 17th after hours. After $APHA earnings recently they didn't do insanely well, but they beat expectations. $TLRY and $APHA both shot up right after that. If $TLRY beats tomorrow, I could see something similar happening even though price is still up a large amount.

&#x200B;

The **merger with $APHA** has been a big catalyst recently and is set to happen in Q2. This will make Aphria and Tilray the biggest cannabis company in the world by revenue. Together they will be able to grow even faster than now.

&#x200B;

I guarantee they will talk about the merger tomorrow in the earnings meeting, and I feel like we will get some positive hype from what they say.

&#x200B;

**TLRY announces contacts in France, Portugal, Spain, and the U.K. very recently.** Here's the global reach map from Tilray's website:

[Tilray Global Reach Map](https://preview.redd.it/4z4ywhn9hth61.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=2530afb0b698eab032df6be25c3cf65a47770919)

As you can see they're already pretty fucking well spread out. With the addition of APHA as well as APHA buying Sweetwater in the US, they'll already be established in the USA and be able to enter the market easier if we can ever get to decrim/legalization.

&#x200B;

**2021 legalization hopes.** Kind of reminds me of the market pumping on stimmy hopes. With the dems taking over I say we have a better chance. Even if some states pass additional bills all weed stocks could see a pump. There are a number of states with bills that are already in the works in a few states.

[Most recent 5 press released from Tilray's site](https://preview.redd.it/8vpue77djth61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=7adf72476d7c26f222dfb062721f71cad39c6c20)

I don't know what better news you could ask for from a cannabis company. Big milestones, and creating big opportunities for them in different markets.

Another interesting thing with Tilray is the **price difference with $APHA.** This is important to note because  *""Under terms of the agreement, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, a 23% premium to Tilrays.""*

$APHA at the time of this post currently is **$18.35, and $TLRY is $30.19.** That basically means Aphria is trading at about 60% of Tilray's price. I bet as we get closer to the merger, price will get closer to that .83 area. That means Tilray either has to come down more / Aphria will have to come up to meet in the middle.

The **short interest** has definitely changed recently as well, and a lot of fake numbers have been thrown around. With the whole $GME deal anything with short interest and a little WSB spice has been getting pumped.  Since $TLRY already did it in 2018, it's not wild to say it can do it again. Already saw a a huge pump, but I don't think it's over.

&#x200B;

That's about it. Had $480 in account on January 6th, now sitting at like 24k. Popped above 60k last week. I have diamond hands tho. Majority of $ in $30, $55, $60c leaps for Tilray that I got a while ago. I also have about 20% in $AG because I'm bullish on silver. Posted some screens on account for you ""gimme proof"" fuckers. Good luck to all.

&#x200B;

If you got some counters as to why I'm just 100% off on this, shoot them at me

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Buy Tilray and Aphria

The Inside Story of WSB And AMC,1676,ll1eed,https://v.redd.it/zt8qvxjxkth61,85,1613501485.0,,2021-02-16 20:51:25
Dear Noobs: how you could have anticipated the crash of GME and not lost 80%,0,ll1cct,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll1cct/dear_noobs_how_you_could_have_anticipated_the/,47,1613501221.0,"I'm not saying that this is guaranteed to have predicted this outcome, however I am saying that the following information would have set alarms off in the minds of experienced traders.

The concept of ""Depth of Market"" is crucial in my view. Completely new traders probably will not know what this is.

Limit orders are placed for buying and selling, and they sit there, providing possible liquidity until a matching order is made, either a limit order or market order. This is basically the depth of market.

For example, if I place a limit buy order at $5, but there are no existing sell limit orders at $5, then my limit order will sit there until a matching order at $5 comes along to sell me that share at $5.

Let's say there are buy limit orders for a quantity of a billion shares at $5, which have not been filled due to a lack of sellers at that price. In order for the price to go below $5, those billion buy limit orders would need to be filled before the buy limit orders below that would be filled, effectively, because usually people that are looking to sell aren't looking to sell at a lower price than what they could get, realistically.

So, if that is true, then it would make sense that all of those buy limit orders are sort of a wall that makes it harder for the price to drop.

If you take away the ability for investors to place those buy limit orders that support the price when it falls - stopping it from falling much further and then possibly reversing back up, then you literally remove all reason for the price to sustain its level, because eventually the buy limit orders will become exhausted, no new orders being allowed, and the aggressive sellers will walk right through to lower and lower prices.

In the previous example, if instead of a billion shares worth of buy limit orders at $5, it were 3 shares worth of buy limit orders at $5, it would be far easier for the price to drop in the latter case than the former, because those 3 shares worth of buy limit orders at $5 are easier to deplete and then move to the buy limit orders at a lower price, such as $4.99

This explains roughly what happened when the brokers removed the ability to buy GME and AMC, they virtually ensured a lower quantity of buy limit orders, and therefore weakened the support that the market had to support its price level, dramatically.

An experienced trader who knows about depth of market, and now you too, would likely have pondered the likelihood of a far weaker support for the price level, and expected a reversal.",2021-02-16 20:47:01
Blackrock is holding a huge put position on SPY going into the new year.🐻,65,ll1574,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll1574/blackrock_is_holding_a_huge_put_position_on_spy/,64,1613500313.0,"TLDR: Read the title

If you follow my comments, I've been pretty bearish lately so I'm obviously always looking for my daily dose of confirmation basis. Blackrock is still overall bullish on the market and took a HUGE position on TSLA, I've also seen companies switch from bonds to shares of TSLA recently which may speak to a continuation.

Even though their call position on SPY is still larger than their put position, they increased their hedge by 12000% (basically nonexistent to very tangible) while their call position only increased a comparatively modest 52%

The Bill and Melinda Fund has retreated a bit from the market, they withdrew a sizable portion of their positions and only bought one stock, schrodinger Inc.

I haven't had time to look into more firms due to work, but I wanted to share this information with anyone who might be overly bullish. Keep a little cash on the sideline, don't overexpose yourself with margin, and if there is a major correction, please know that long $ROPE isn't worth it. There will always be another bull market to run up.

I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,40507,lkzviy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/,2089,1613494449.0,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",2021-02-16 18:54:09

Take a look. Good DD, and I am in. That said, I think it is great to look ahead, and look beyond just steels, coppers, silver/gold.

We know EV is going to be the future, and we know there are raw materials needed for this pipeline. But, what is needed? Check this graph:

OK, it does not matter if our smooth brain can understand how these metals and resources are used in the EV industry. What important is that, there will be a parabolic growth in demand! And more growth means $$$$.

Now how do we play with this? Here are just a few of my thoughts and you are welcome to post your findings. Let us start with some boring, 'safer' play, etfs:

LIT: lithium batteries miners and techs

BATT: similar to LIT.

COPX: you know copper :)

REMX: rare earth miners, mostly in China (no surprise).

However, I do think there are more tendies in these miners and royalty companies that most people don't pay attention to. For example, many graphite miners stocks have silently increase over the past year. I will give a few examples, which does not mean I approve them :0

Northern Graphite Corp: 178% in a year:

https://preview.redd.it/55ado2mtvsh61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0a7817cd3ee7ce520ce28e1b61d88db043b3ec

Mason Graphite Inc: 239%.

&#x200B;

etc. The point is, there are many of them, in graphite, cobalt, nickel that are making tendies right now! And our job is to find them. Find these with good mining potentials (which I have no idea).

Warning ahead: miners come with many risks (including geopolitical risks). So, another play is to find royalty companies such as WPM and FNV. What, you tell me you have no ideas what they mean? They are basically angel investors to the miner companies. They provide capital for the miners to explore, and in return take an agreed portion from the entire mine! And they invest in many different miners so their risk is reduced.  That said, I have no f\*\*\*ing idea about non-silver/gold royalty companies. If anyone find them, post your DD for tendies!

TLDR: long miners and royalty companies for great tendies!

FNV: ~7k
WPM: ~6k
FCX: ~3k

The idea is that the hedge funds that shorted GME could have shorted ETF's that contain GME while simultaneous cover GME. They could do this by buying long positions in all the stocks within the ETF's except GME so that they can stay net short GME. This way they could hide the shorts by a middle man.

Can anyone shed light on how short interest impacts when shorters need to close out their position?,62,lkwop3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkwop3/can_anyone_shed_light_on_how_short_interest/,37,1613481570.0," Yes, this thread is borne out of the more recent GME developments.

One benefit of GME's recent phenomenon is that it brought a lot of attention to aspects of how the short market works. And also there's been an awareness to sorts of data that is available for review. Personally, I was aware 13F filings and the SEC's short interest report. In the course of GME's roller coaster, I became aware of S3 Partners and Ortex, and data that they provide. So there's been opportunities to learn more about how certain markets operate and the data that is available to help guide decisions that investors may make.

In various subs, there's been continual updates of short interest data. Every day it seems there's a post about how the hedge funds didn't close their positions...or if they did, they opened new ones, so GME is still over shorted.

While I think this information is educational. I also think that there is a shortcoming of these kinds of declarations, and that they have the potential for being misleading or irresponsible. What I don't see in these kinds of posts is analysis of what this information actually is supposed to suggest. I think the most popular sentiment is that reading these facts ultimately forces the reader to make assumptions about what this information means...and since the OPs don't usually provider a particular stance, I think most readers take these posts as an assurance of sorts to indicate that they should continue to hold GME and/or not to lose faith because either another squeeze must happen OR that they'll be able to recover their unrealized losses.

Obviously we know that you can lose unless you sell, but I think that if a person is going to tout how ""the hedge funds still didn't close"", that it should be incumbent upon them to state why the fact that they didn't close their positions (or did close them but opened new ones) should have any meaningful value to people who hold the fund.

It's tantamount to making an argument by innuendo where the reader becomes responsible for drawing a conclusion about the beneficial value of the information that is provided.

As someone who isn't holding any bags on GME but is interested in the dynamics of short interest, I've been curious to know if the hedge funds' strategy of delaying the significant closing out of short positions is tenable, and if so, for how long. And in what way do fails-to-deliver impact when the hedge funds have to make good on their obligation? Or perhaps some cost comparison between the cost of short interest vs the cost of having to make good on their fail to delivers.

For many, the answer to these kinds of questions might give some people a hope of thinking another squeeze is probable and it might give people a belief of when they can expect an uptrend on the stock price. People will find a reason to hold out hope regardless. I just think that if people want to tout how the shorts are still out there, then there should be some sort of aspect of their post that addresses the question of ""what am I supposed to conclude from this information?""",2021-02-16 15:19:30

This is no brilliant way to make money that’s for sure but I do find it infinitely entertaining trying to build portfolios out that pay for that element of my life.

# VERY BRIEF HISTORY

Vaxart is making an oral COVID-19 vaccine. A few weeks ago, the stock price of Vaxart rapidly went up before sharply falling following the release of “positive” preliminary phase 1 clinical trial data. Why? Because their release stated that no “serum neutralizing antibodies” were produced, which the market apparently—and quite incorrectly—took as an indication of failure. Fortunately for me, the market does not understand immunology. I have owned shares of Vaxart for a few months now. I was watching (and holding) as the stock price rapidly increased a few weeks ago. As the stock price rapidly dropped, I bought more. When it dropped even further, I bought even more. Why? Because (1) Serum neutralizing antibodies were never Vaxart’s selling point for me, and (2) Vaxart has what Moderna and Pfizer will literally *never* have: The key needed to achieve herd immunity. (Hold that thought.)

# IMMUNOLOGY BASICS

“Immunoglobulins” (abbreviate “Ig”) are the “antibody” molecules our immune system makes to keep bugs at bay. There are 4 primary immunoglobulins: IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE. When a bug is swimming around in your blood, your immune system quickly makes IgM. If that bug won’t leave you alone, your immune system will “level up” and transition to making IgG instead. This transition from IgM to IgG usually takes at least a few weeks. If that bug leaves but then bothers you later in life, your body will remember where it left off and quickly make an even stronger IgG for you. IgA is quite different because it hangs out in all the “sticky” places of your body referred to as the “mucosa”—your nose, mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, anus, penis, vagina, and even the milk ducts of your nipples. When a baby is born, mom can give the baby IgG through the womb and IgA through her milk. This keeps babies alive while their tiny immune systems are growing up and becoming independent. (We can ignore IgE for this discussion.) These immunoglobulins/antibodies have a few weapons in their arsenal to use against bugs: The bugs can be labeled as an enemy for our allies to then attack, the bugs can be stabbed to death, or the bugs can be quarantined in a little box so that they can’t hurt you. In fact, “neutralizing antibodies” essentially quarantine bugs so that they can’t do any harm. When we say “serum neutralizing antibodies” we usually mean IgG swimming around in the blood. However, IgA is also very much a “neutralizing antibody” though remember it is found mostly in the “sticky” places of our body. This will be important later.

# VACCINE BASICS

Most vaccines work by essentially pulling a fakie on our immune system by using pieces of bugs (or even just dead bugs) so that we begin making our little soldier immunoglobulins/antibodies before the bug actually arrives. Unfortunately, vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response. Most (but not all) vaccines primarily produce serum IgG (“neutralizing antibody”). Remember from above that IgM transitions to IgG and that this usually takes at least few weeks? This is why most vaccines require at least one booster shot. You know our stomach is used to digest food? This is why most vaccines are given to us with a needle (because our stomach would destroy the vaccine).

Vaccines can be thought of as existing in two groups: (1) Vaccines that stop you from dying, and (2) Vaccines that stop you from giving your bug to others. While both of these categories are immensely useful, **only this second category can result in herd immunity**. More on that in a moment. While it would be ideal for all vaccines to fall perfectly into both categories at the same time, the vaccines that manage to achieve that are usually live vaccines (which we try to avoid using). Polio is a great example as there were both live and killed polio vaccines. The killed polio vaccine prevented disease and death, but it did not prevent people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. On the other hand, the live polio vaccine prevented disease and death as well as prevented people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. (Live vaccines are otherwise beyond this discussion.)

# HERD IMMUNITY

Herd immunity is when a population as a whole becomes effectively immune to a bug simply because that bug lost its ability to travel between people. (A spider cannot bite you if it cannot get to you!) There are two primary ways to achieve herd immunity: (1) Mass natural infection, and (2) Mass vaccination. Mass natural infection is by far the most effective option (because it triggers a full immune response), but it is also by far the most lethal. Voluntarily attempting to achieve herd immunity through mass natural infection would incredibly devastating and a clearly unethical option for a bug like COVID-19.

Remember from above that vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response? This is partly why the flu vaccine only gives us a partial herd immunity. (Influenza also mutates a lot.) This is also why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will almost certainly never come close to providing us with herd immunity. These vaccines are missing the key to herd immunity.

What piece of the immune system makes herd immunity possible? It does not matter if herd immunity is achieved through mass infection or through mass vaccination, the primary and required key is—by far—IgA. Remember from above that IgA primarily lives in the “sticky” parts of our bodies, but also remember from above that most vaccines primarily produce IgG? We need IgA in the “sticky” places because that’s where most bugs enter our bodies. We need IgG once those bugs have found their way inside of us.

# ANALOGY

As an analogy, imagine an arsonist catching a house on fire. The IgG would be the firefighters and police coming to put out the fire and arrest the arsonist. IgG is doing great work! But this doesn’t fix the damage that’s been done, it does not guarantee that the burglar won’t burn down another home once released from jail, and it does not protect your home from being burned down again a year from now. On the other hand, IgA would be the gated fence surrounding the home, motion sensor security lights, security cameras, and alarm system that ultimately results in the arsonist moving along from your home to target a much easier home with fewer front-line defenses. In this analogy, vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer are the police and firefighters (because they produce mostly IgG) whereas vaccines like Vaxart and Altimmune are the fences, lights, and alarms (because they produce mostly IgA). While no home is ever truly safe from being burned down, having the most security features exponentially decreases the odds of houses being burned down. Indeed, it is exceedingly difficult to find a house that has been burned down by an arsonist in a community that has equipped all of these security features on every home.

# CONCLUSION

**Pfizer, Moderna, and even Novavax will likely continue protect us from dying of COVID, but we will still harbor and transmit COVID** within our mucosa (while likely being mostly asymptomatic). Most concerningly, this will be how we will inevitably breed innumerable new variants of COVID throughout the world. Hopefully these will be no more severe than the current dominant strain, but we must keep in mind that SARS and MERS (though less transmissible) are both coronaviruses and that all it would take is for just the right mutation(s) to take place for COVID-19 to become far deadlier. **While the current authorized vaccines are wonderful and are absolutely necessary in fighting the pandemic, they have—and will always have—devastating shortcomings for which we will ultimately pay if we do not bridge this gap in susceptibility quickly. Vaxart and Altimmune seem to be the two most promising candidates to help us bridge this gap through their mucosal IgA protection.** There is so much ground to cover with a lot more room for additional vaccines to round out our defenses. **At minimum, we must achieve both an IgG response (to prevent disease and death)** ***and*** **an IgA response (to prevent transmission). Without the prevention of transmission, it is not “if” but “when” we ultimately breed a devastatingly fatal breed of coronavirus.** We have wonderful IgG vaccines. Let us support and work hard to ensure we get some IgA vaccines as soon as possible so that we can all be safe and return to normal life.

The only analyst that seems to have unwavering optimism for Vaxart is Mayank Mamtani (top 100 on TipRanks) with a price target of $16 (+100% upside), but even his reasoning is, while not incorrect, totally different from my own reasoning and ultimately fails to see a bigger picture.

I just wanted to drop this in as a reality check for people before they go charging in like idiots and in all likelihood are met with disappointment. I commented this on the first post but thought it may have better reach as it's own standalone post.


The other post : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkn9vj/fnma_and_fmcc_going_to_explode_soon_compare_them/



I've been following this trade for about 4 years now. I bought in at a bad time and I'm underwater but I still believe in the underlying investment thesis and thus have not sold all the times I've been above water too.

I am going to quickly break it down for people:

INVESTMENT THESIS:

FNMA and FMCC (the companies) basically got taken over by the government, they are massively profitable but all of their money goes to Uncle Fucking Sam, like in perpetuity. This is because in 2012 Uncle Sam saw they were going to be profitable and possibly pay back the original loan they made during the '08 crisis, and they didn't like that, so they just... changed the agreement. :) 

Seriously, go read the emails that were sent at this time by government officials, read about the meetings they had and the information they were provided. For me, this was clearly robbery and then they lied about it. That being said, the court cases that have been chasing this agreement for years now lost a lot, largely because of the complexity of HERA (the statute that governs the FHFA, the conservator of FNMA and FMCC) and the courts never really looking at the evidence but rather whether or not they even were allowed to. However, plaintiffs had a massive victory in the 5th Circuit Court of appeals, which was then appealed to SCOTUS. You can go listen to the SCOTUS oral argument and we are now waiting their ruling.

INVESTMENT VEHICLES:

The other post was pumping the common, this is likely a massive mistake. The jr pfds are likely much better and still have a potential 5x upside at today's prices (a month or so ago I put in another 12k). There are MANY MANY things that need to go right for the common to payout, and the commons basically have zero legal representation at the moment. Pfds have much fewer things that need to go right to get paid and have almost all the heavy hitters behind them. Ackman is the only guy holding commons I believe.

WHAT MAY HAPPEN:

Right now we are all-in on a SCOTUS ruling in our favor. 5th circuit went our way but all those gains have been sold off. If we win SCOTUS, guess what, if the government doesn't settle we could still be waiting 2-3 years for the APA claims to be judged on evidence. We have a STRONG case on that though and the government likely doesn't want egg on its face. If SCOTUS goes against us good fucking luck, we have one more case that is slated for 1.5 years from now or so and besides that we're at the mercy of the new admin and congress (e.g. we lose 50% or so from here at least).

WHERE WE HAVE BEEN:

The previous admin promised to make changes and get us out of conservatorship and basically failed to deliver entirely. The companies cap standards are pretty miserable now and Mnuchin basically kicked the can down the road (pray to Yellen if you buy in cause you're her bitch now). Court cases have been like all court cases and infinitely slow but the gears do turn.

HOW TO DO SOME DD:

Go follow holdenwalker99 and urbankaoboy on Twitter. Do not follow Glenn (used to post as /u/TheSerpent
 on here). That guy is a fucking moron who has some major fucking ego problems. You will come across his name often on this trade as he is a good flag bearer, but don't pay any attention to his thinking, like I said, fucking moron. The two dudes I mentioned are probably the most rational and knowledgeable (respectively) people I have come across in the years I have been following it. Glenn is more like the mascot at a sports game while the other two are the players.

Anyways, if you buy in, be prepared for the long haul. This trade is something that forever seems to be just a few weeks around the corner to a Nirvana that never comes. Many people have aptly called it the ""Waiting for Godot"" trade for that reason.

Anyways, good luck!

TL/DR - If you choose to go in  buy jr pfds, avoid the ones that have zero % interest rates right now, and good fucking luck to us all.

One picture should help you decide which weed company to invest in (Hint: It's not $SNDL),171,lkv973,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkv973/one_picture_should_help_you_decide_which_weed/,187,1613476743.0,"I know this sub hates 🌈🐻, but every once in a while a healthy dose of cynicism can help this growing community. Lately there has been a lot of activity surrounding $SNDL and how it's going to be THE weed company if/when the US legalizes. 

[Top 50 weed companies: Left US, Right Canada, latest quarterly earnings and change from prior quarter. Twitter: cannabisnewsDD](https://preview.redd.it/o0xzutazgrh61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffccfd9cb88f0f19402efa77a7dbadf2d2cbdc7)

I know you autists hate numbers, so I've provided a picture for you. Notice where SNDL is? Nowhere near the fucking top. In fact, if you combined this list into one, they would be 42nd. If the US legalizes weed, there are already a huge amount of companies already primed and ready to go for the US market. Even if they were a US player, they wouldn't be one of the major players.

Now lets address some popular points:

**SHORT SQUEEZE JUST LIKE $GME TO THE MOON!**

Now there has been a lot of talk about how there's going to be a ""short squeeze"" on SNDL and one google search to find they have 1.5 BILLION shares outstanding should be enough for even the average autists to realize this isn't likely. In fact the company recently filed to sell even more shares to raise cash. 

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us74-5-million-registered-offering-301222544.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us74-5-million-registered-offering-301222544.html)

**But they have cash, don't they?**

No shit, they have cash, they're issues shares like it's the toilet paper shortage. It doesn't matter, they aren't profitable and not a big player. You know who is profitable? Many of the **US companies** on the left

**I heard their weed is really great! Someone commented on that?**

Really? Who isn't going to say their weed is amazing? If anything, their weed is so bad, investors have sued them for not disclosing how bad it is:

Honestly the fact that there is a widely circulated meme picture that people are going to hold this stock until $420 should be enough to deter you from the stock. 

If you're looking for a weed company to ride the potential US legalization, pick a company on the left. $SNDL is **NOT** it. Do not fall for all the bag holders and bots waiting for you to rescue them.

AMD strong upside for this week.,362,lkujx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkujx7/amd_strong_upside_for_this_week/,95,1613474451.0,"I honestly should have posted this last week because the trade is already in progress, but there is probably still time:

**The DD:**

AMD has strong upside for this week. There are two basic reasons for my view on this.

1. Fundamental points:
   1. Strong earnings reports over the past 3 quarters.
   2. Despite strong earnings, no real price spike. Been hovering between 80-90.
2. Technical points:
   1. The stock cross the 9-day moving average on 2/8/2021
   2. The stock formed a golden cross on 2/8/2021. This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it's continuing to go.
   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.
   4. Crossed 50 day moving average on 2/10/2021

&#x200B;

[Top is price action on 9-day. Middle is MACD. Bottom is RSI. If you don't know what these terms mean then please look them up.](https://preview.redd.it/7hj2tc6jbrh61.jpg?width=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7859d033c6af8f430eddefcfd30d7960da6a2bf1)

Basically, on the fundamentals this stock is ""due"" for a push up. On the technical side, we can see that it's starting to go up.

Overall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed. And now with the futures up it's likely going to open up a lot higher, but still I see room to go up.

**The exit strategy:**

If you do decide to enter this trade, and it does become profitable for you, here is how you can look to get out.

1. On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it's reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it's the general rule and if you know it you're better off than if you don't know anything at all.
2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I'd take all my money off the table. 

I use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.

Do with this what you will. I have no idea if AMD will continue to rally. But, if I was looking to add a stock to a rolling basket of swing trade positions I would consider AMD.",2021-02-16 13:20:51

TSM - Is it a BUY at $138 ?,119,lktzoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktzoi/tsm_is_it_a_buy_at_138/,80,1613472697.0,"$TSM - I am in with a cost average at $102. I first invested in it at  $50 but since sold that position was able to re-enter and stayed with my positions at $76 and $103. With 36 shares total I am excited and hopeful this TSM with continue to rally. It even pays a 1.59% Annual Dividend but comes with a small foreign tax fee, my latest tax fee was $.19.

They have purchased land in Arizona for $89 million to manufacture 5nm chips and they expect production can start in 2024 and the project will continue to 2029 with an estimated cost at $12 billion dollars. With expectations of 4nm and 3nm being manufactured by 2022. The P/E is slightly higher than the average with earnings just shy of the average. So your paying a premium but for the largest semiconductor manufacture with a market cap at $715B you also get an advantage in the market with a respectable stock price history, market exposure and a positive future with increasing ability to manufacture more chips in the upcoming years.

I don't think TSM is far away from hitting the $150 and beyond. [Stockinvest.us](https://Stockinvest.us) has price projections near $200 in the next 3 months. I am not too concerned with the timeline but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it hit $150 next week. I tend to be a bit bullish on TSM and I see this chip shortage being the catalyst that can give us a strong first quarter. With the chip shortage being fueled by the high demand in the auto industry among all the new smart technology devices.

I don't believe investing in TSM or into any position for just 1 reason or even for somebody else's reasons is wise. It's easy to pull up the graph and see the upward trend but I am trying to focus on need for TSM products and the ways they plan on increasing production.

How and if you choose to invest in TSM is up to you. I am long TSM and I am interested in the following as well. 

ON,MU,ASML,AMAT,LRCX 

I hope this was helpful to someone. I think it would be a good idea to at least give it a second look for those looking for Semiconductor exposure.",2021-02-16 12:51:37
DraftKings DD - Earnings report 2/26,55,lktwtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktwtk/draftkings_dd_earnings_report_226/,29,1613472430.0,"As of 2/2, momma Cathy's got about 620,000 shares of Draftkings on board the ARKW.

In the last week and a half since then, we've seen DraftKings hit its 52 week high on 2/5 of $63.57, and a nice little expected pullback that was further dragged down due to the outages seen on SuperBowl Sunday, outages that affected not just DKNG but hurt Penn, Fanduel, etc.

In addition to this dip, we saw Cathy bring on another 800,000 shares to the ARK in this time which was published on the Ark Invest site, seen in the holdings report put out on 2/12 report.

This makes sense for anyone opening up a long position in a company they see as a disruptive force for the future, but what caught my eye here was the fact that the **next earnings report is on 2/26, a little shy of 3 weeks away from these moves.**

Looking back, DKNG has missed the mark and their projected earnings in recent quarters due to their insistence on advertising spending and more notably the lack of active sports to bet on in Q2 and Q3 of last year, but Q4 2020 sees the start up of the NFL, the NHL, and the last parts of the NBA Playoffs. This points to a potential to potentially beat projections and start getting things moving in the right direction. Regardless, they're the largest company in online sports betting and currently lead other online companies in this sector with 16% of the market locked down since October.

With legalization of sports gambling in our future with the new administration, a lot of heads have been turning to this market and there's a sizable chunk of revenue incentivizing the legalization in the states that haven't done so already.

I've been a long time lurker and haven't commented a whole lot but I figured I'd share my thoughts on this, one retard to another. Feel free to put me up on the cross for anything I might have stated incorrectly or messed up.

TL/DR

ARKW more than doubled their position in DKNG the past 2 weeks and we're coming up on an earnings report that has some potential to be a sign of things turning around for sports betting in a covid world

At current price level $126/share (P/E of 12ish), $DGX is the closest thing you can find to guaranteed tendies. Will it be a 10 bagger? While possible, probably not. However, **it is a virtual lock for a double up+ play trading calls.**

It isn't often you come across a stock with minimal potential headwinds (i.e. ""risk"", ya autists) , a strong reputation, over a billion of $ on hand, and coming off of consecutive Qs of record revenue growth and margin expansion **THAT IS TRADING AT ROUGHLY HALF THE P/E of many competitors.**

**Also, some** **52 week price performance:**

1. QDEL - 185%
2. LH - 27.1%
3. DGX - 13.4%

*Ok, I don't know what P/E ratio is jackass. I joined WSB 3 weeks ago. What else ya got?* Oh, plenty. Just starting with the very basic stuff. I'll even avoid deeper analytics since I know you all would just breeze past em anyway.

**Recent Earnings Call & Guidance (2/4/21):**

Historically, Q4 is a down Q for DGX because people aren't running to the doctors and undergoing procedures during the holiday season. Granted I schedule all of my appointments during this time to avoid the in-laws, but apparently I'm in the minority. Anyway, **DGX actually beat lofty expectations in Q4 and drastically raised guidance for the first 6 months of 2021.** Key items:

* Beat estimated Revenue by 2.73%, EPS 5.7%
* Quarter Revenue growth (yoy) over 55%, Earnings over 120%
* Announced additional ONE BILLION, with a $B, authorization in share repurchases. This is in addition to $900m+ previously approved. **Quest is approved for nearly TWO BILLION in $ share repurchases for 2021**. More importantly, the c-suite flat out stated they planned on being aggressive in repurchasing during the year after pulling back in 2020 during the call.

1. In 2020, DGX only repurchased $325m: [https://ycharts.com/companies/DGX/stock\_buyback](https://ycharts.com/companies/DGX/stock_buyback)
2. As previously mentioned, they are sitting on a boatload of cash...especially after more government AR converts
3. Their CEO is a dinosaur. He will be using almost all of this TWO BILLION authorization

* Increased dividend by 10%
* Great continued improvements in serology area
* **NOTE:** This company is notoriously CONSERVATIVE in their projections. Sandbagging pricks.

**THE ONE & ONLY CONCERN -** The reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and naïve.** Reasons:

* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.
* **COVID Testing - Rampant testing isn't going anywhere anytime soon**. As of Jan 26th, all international flights require a COVID test to return (obviously DGX, LH, etc. are facilitating much of this work). Then rumors swirled this week that negative tests could potentially become required to fly even domestically. Millions of students remain out of school...reminder the current vaccines are mostly for age 16+. So expect strict testing for students too during 2021, mandated by the crybaby teacher unions. Sport leagues as well as I'm sure not everyone will get the vaccine.
* **Political climate / stimulus** \- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now ""recommending"" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.
* **$$$$$$$** \- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions in 2nd half 2021 and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis.

**VERY quick chart breakdown** \- most of you prob don't chart a ton, but doesn't take DFV to see the long sustained consolidation. This is begging to jump upwards and it will by next earnings. Even better, outside of an overall market pullback, there aren't any potential catalysts for a downward swing.

**Worthless analyst commentary** \- Most recently, Citi upgraded PT to $158 on 1/29.

**POSITIONS** \- Again, I see VERY little risk in this move. Worst Case PT: $120, Best Case: $170

The Commodity Super-cycle trade: A macro DD with special focus on industrial metals,545,lkse1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkse1l/the_commodity_supercycle_trade_a_macro_dd_with/,190,1613467501.0,"“Commodities? What the hell is that?” asks the GME Ape, used to blockbusters stocks and phone companies from the 90s. We are talking oil, natural gas, industrial and precious metals, corn, GOURDS, etc. Got it? You don’t want to mess with commodity futures? No problem, there are more than enough stocks and ETFs proxies through which you can place your bets. But before tackling tickers, let’s talk fundamentals and let me lay out the bullish case for commodities, specifically industrial metals (steel😲, copper, aluminum, rare earth metals).

# Commodity Super-cycle?

Commodities go through cycles of booms and bust, following economic cycles of activity, and inflation. Growth and inflation make commodities go uppies, and recessions or periods of slower economic growth, coupled with deflationary pressures, make commodities go tits up. Specifically, commodities tend to rise rapidly when the economy goes into “overdrive” mode, so towards the second half of economic expansions. This is because as the economy accelerates, the supply for raw materials can’t keep up with the demand, leading to price escalations up to a point where demand has to correct abruptly, causing a recession. Then, commodity prices free fall as the economy goes through deflation, and investment typically shifts towards innovation and disruptive tech, preparing for the new cycle. Then, the economy eventually recovers and starts to slowly pick up speed, and the new cycle is in. You can see that post-2000 (coinciding more or less with the pop of the .com bubble), was the start of a rally in commodities (**Chart 1).**

**Chart 1: US commodity price index 1795 to present** (as of August 2020)

https://preview.redd.it/gmz5xuox7ph61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a262060bed4870cf4bc0834a46f71d5ccd5fa21

Why was that? We were coming out of a pretty long period of economic deflationary stability and then accelerated going into the 2000s. As inflation started to pick up, investment flew out of tech and into commodities, given the demand for them was massive. There was massive GDP growth coming from the BRICS, the .com tech creating more jobs and more income/household, and massive lending growth backed by the US housing market (the economy was leveraged to the tits); all this strong, *tangible* (this is crucial, more on that later) economic activity generated a lot of demand for raw materials as houses and factories were built, cars were manufactured, cities rose all around the world (particularly in Asia), and so commodity prices went uppies. Of course, the economy was overleveraged, and like most FDs you hold for too long, it went tits up real quick at the expiration date. The recession post-GFC sent commodities down, and when there was economic recovery, commodities stayed pretty low. Why was that? Deflationary pressures coming from a risk-averse banking system and an increasingly efficient, high tech-driven economy could be a place to start. But from a cycle perspective, this was still the first half of the economic expansion following the recession, and there was still too much deflation for commodities to pick up real momentum. Of course, when March 2020 hit and everything went tits up, what little momentum commodities had was instantly lost as the entire world economy went through a massive deflationary bust. Suddenly, nothing moved, and nothing was built, and so there was barely any demand for commodities. But now that we begin to recover from the pandemic, are things any different than they were prior to it? If before the dreadful 2020 commodities were cheap, why would they begin to rally in 2021?

I’ll begin by analyzing what is going on right now with commodities from a technical perspective, and then I’ll give you what I think is the *why* behind it? Sounds good? Let’s dive into it then.

# What’s the technical outlook?

Being guilty of serious crayon-eating to the point of literally shitting colors every weekend, I never build a thesis without some technical ANALysis, so let’s look at a few charts to see where we are in the cycle technically, and then I’ll make the fundamental argument for the industrial metals reversal. **Chart 1** showed that we are at exceptionally low price levels, and it also shows that commodities don’t tend to stay at those prices very long. However, is a reversal going on right now? For this, no need to go back to Napoleonic Wars, let’s just look at the last decade or so. There is in fact a technical reversal in commodities going on, and it would be confirmed if we get above 90-100 on the BCOM (**Chart 2**). The *Coom*berg Commodity Index tracks commodity prices.

**Chart 2:** ***Coom*****berg Commodity Index (BCOM)**

https://preview.redd.it/kjfw2vma8ph61.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ad8c833da4702d11cbb358c90ed909ac5c8c63d

Let’s have a look now at some specifics, namely industrial metals. Commodities tend to move in unison, so it is expected from steel (and, in the case of an index, companies working along the steel supply chain) to have a similar price action to the BCOM. Indeed, you can see on **Chart 3** that it’s the same breakout of the multi-year trend.

**Chart 3:** **ARCA Steel Index (STTL)**

https://preview.redd.it/ub7trgae8ph61.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0ff90918a5ba4ee9235b843a8f814bf96fee621

What about copper? Yeah, the same thing, but more extended than its industrial metal peers (**Chart 4**), due to the fact there has been quite a few strikes going on causing a supply shock, but I also believe people understood the vital role of copper in the EV industry and in de-carbonization (more on that later) a few months before they realized most industrial metals were going to go along the same path.

**Chart 4:** **US Copper Index Fund (CPER)**

https://preview.redd.it/2bwl1t5i8ph61.jpg?width=1820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899bc4e45465edda59e86dd73a987a4a364a93d9

As you would expect, other industrial metals, such as aluminum, follow similar patterns. While WSB was screeching GME (except Steel Bros, you guys nailed it), industrial metals were rallying, and are now at their inflection point, or past it (in the case of copper for example). So why is any of this happening? While we’re still on a crayon-eating binge, let’s have a look at the 5-yr forward inflation expectations chart (**Chart 5**). Ok, so consumers and businesses are expecting prices to increase at a higher rate 5 years from now, and believe inflation will be over 2% in 2025. Do you see a similarity with the BCOM? That’s because commodities and inflation go hand in hand, as I explained previously. While inflation is not sitting over 2% right now, it is expected to be in the future and commodity traders and hedge funds are already placing their bets, so the market is adjusting ahead of time, as it should.

**Chart 5:** **5-yr Forward Inflation Expectation Rate**

https://preview.redd.it/pp39er5m8ph61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=543768ae6d5f09e89eb809ba7c4985707db69ab1

But isn’t inflation good for all equities? If we were to rely solely on inflation expectations, why would commodities be a better move than say, tech? My belief is that the huge rally that has been going on with Big Tech for years was fueled by deflation, not inflation. Our economy has only become more and more efficient given all of the technological innovation that has been going on (think of automation), leaving people out of work with less income and driving prices down. This is good for tech, but it is rather deflationary, so when I hear inflation expectations are up significantly, it makes me rather neutral to bearish on tech, and much more bullish on commodities. For now, let’s have a look at **Chart 6**, a ratio between the S&P500 and the PPI (the log of that actually). The way to interpret this is the following: when the ratio is going up, stocks, in general, are beating commodities, and when it is going down, commodities are beating stocks. Obviously, this excludes stocks which revenues rely on commodities since those stocks would typically be up when commodities are up (ex: metal processing stocks, mining stocks, etc.). Periods of inflation are better for commodities than for stocks, and vice-versa for deflationary phases. It doesn’t necessarily mean stocks will go down when inflation runs higher, but commodities will tend to outperform the market. One extreme case of this was the .com bubble pop, which immediately made commodities more attractive than stocks, and coincided with the start of an inflationary period that lasted until around the GFC.

**Chart 6:** **S&P 500/PPI (log)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/me3zn6sq8ph61.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73bf6327287e80202491966eb1d8da994337d40

So by looking at this chart, seeing that we have been in a prolonged period of relative deflation, recognizing that equities are pretty overextended as of right now compared to commodities, and noting that inflation expectations are up (meaning a new wave of inflation might be forming ahead), I would argue that solely based on this there exists an arbitrage opportunity: short tech, long commodities. But shorting tech is rather wild, and if you are a conflicted bull that knows the tech rally must be approaching its end but you won’t go full u/Variation-Separate, you might as well just long commodities while reducing your tech exposure, or at least add some of that sweet sweet *coom*modity to your folio as a hedge.

This concludes our technical analysis for now. Congrats if you’ve made it this far and managed to keep your rectum intact, you’ve survived. Now, why is this taking place now? In other words, why are inflation expectations up now, as opposed to a year or two from now? Why is the BCOM breaking out of its multi-year downtrend right now, while we’re still mostly on lockdown when it’s been falling for years under a “normal” economy? Calling a bottom is as hard as calling a top, but while sometimes bubbles pop out of sheer exhaustion, it is rarer for prices to rebound after years of downtrend without any catalyst. So what’s the catalyst then? Is it just Grandpa Buyden and his big, long, and beautiful stimulus, or is there something else?

# What’s the fundamental outlook?

Now comes the juicy part. This is the sauce, this is what you came looking for and this is what will hopefully give you the confirmation bias you need and deserve. The question we must ask ourselves is the following: are the conditions for a commodity rally, more precisely in industrial metals, met or be met in the near future?

In other words, is there right now or will there be in the near future a supply and demand imbalance in industrial metals? If we look at the charts, it appears there is one, given the rally we’ve had in the past weeks, but this could just be speculation, right? Or maybe there was one, but now it’s all priced in? I’ll try to give you reasons for the current imbalance, as well as reasons for further imbalances in the future that will likely end up causing a multi-year rally similar to ones before (think 1970s, 2000s). The reasons are the following: Buyden’s Stimulus Plan, “Going Green”, China’s Infrastructure Spending, China’s Accumulation of Metals, India increasing CapEx spending, Wealth Redistribution Policies and Years of Low CapEx in the Commodity Complex. I’ll split these into 2 groups, the demand side, and the supply side.

# Demand

**-Buyden’s Stimulus Plan and “Going Green”**

Now, I know bears will say this is blasphemy. They will say fiscal policy won’t spur inflation; no matter how much spending, the government has never had any success creating inflation and it won’t this time either. I hear you and I agree, untargeted and irresponsible spending has never had any success in generating any kind of sustainable inflation. But are we going to ignore the fact that this is 1.9 trillion + another 2 trillion for infrastructure? Are we going to ignore the fact that Yellen believes this can achieve FULL EMPLOYMENT by 2022? Full employment people, in one year. This would be an economy on fucking steroids, and the price of going into full employment in such a short period of time is inflation. I just can’t see supply being able to adjust to such an increase in household income in such a short period of time, that is if full employment is really to be achieved. Now, full employment could be a pipe dream, it could be yet again another game Yellen is playing to get inflation expectations moving and banks lending, but the sheer possibility of it is enough for the economy to move in that direction. Full employment would be the “overdrive” mode I talked about previously, and that would set the stage for a big rally in commodities. Let me also add that some republicans who opposed Buyden’s plan did so on grounds that it would cause runaway inflation and that such a risk outweighed all of its benefits. It’s all politics, so it doesn’t mean anything on its own, but it can give some idea of the magnitude of how much spending is going on.

Regarding industrial metals like steel, copper, aluminum, and even silver, Buyden’s infrastructure spending is of course bullish. 52% of all steel produced ends up being used for infrastructure projects, so the infrastructure plan aiming at “re-building” a “greener” US is very bullish for steel. New infrastructure, new housing, new buildings and facilities of all kinds is obviously very good for industrial metals. The fact it is meant to be a “green” plan is particularly bullish for copper (think of batteries, wiring, etc.), which has already strongly reacted to this. This in itself is good, but I think it has the potential to have much more growth because it might initiate a bigger modernization wave across all industries, as they strive to “go green”. Just like the US, I can see governments around the world taking the same path; not only because it is good politically as more and more people care about the planet, but because it is a matter of remaining competitive in the future world economy. The automobile industry is going through this change, and ALREADY there is a supply problem. Everybody speaks about the semiconductor shortage, but I think this is just a symptom of a much larger supply issue that is looming ahead. Think about all the factories semiconductor producers will have to build from the ground up to meet demand in the coming years. Some won’t be ready before 2025. What about the famous Elon’s battery gigafactories? Approximately 100 of them will be necessary to supply the entire world with clean energy according to his autist brain (love you Papa), and I assume it is only to meet the current world’s energy demand (wait until India, and eventually Latin America, finalize their industrialization). How many other ambitious projects similar to these will come in the future given all the investment that has been pouring into tech for nearly a decade? What I’m getting at here is that “going green” will cause a “structural change in demand” (quoting Goldman; I typically inverse them, but not this time lol) for industrial metals as there will be A LOT of changes in manufacturing infrastructure, and a good part of it will have to be built from scratch.

This isn’t related to going green, but what about all the innovation going on with 3D printing? Eventually, there will be large 3D printers that will print-out houses and buildings, but they will necessitate gigantic factories to build them so they can build other buildings. You find that funny don’t you? It’s going to fucking happen dude, someday. No, but seriously, all of the crazy innovation that has been going on during the last deflationary years, all of the ARK shit, all of that will eventually have to be built using unconventional and new manufacturing, meaning, you guessed it, more manufacturing infrastructure will have to be built from scratch, causing inflation in industrial metals since the demand will largely outpace the supply like it happens every fucking time. And that’s the super-cycle. It’s the supply of material resources of one economic phase not being able to keep up with the innovation-driven demand from the previous phase, causing prices to escalate during the growth phase. It happened in the 1970s, it happened in the 2000s, and it’ll happen again, sooner rather than later imo.

\-**Gyna: Doubling down on infrastructure spending and accumulating industrial metals**

Say what you will about the china men, but they know what’s up. They understood before anyone that transitioning into a sustainable, greener economy was not nearly as much a moral duty as it was the premise for economic competitiveness. Only now is the US beginning to catch up to what China has been doing for years: invest in infrastructure to enable the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. When the rest of the world was caught up in the GFC mess, instead of having to prop up its financial system, China invested even more in infrastructure and construction jobs. Regarding metals’ accumulation, it is perfectly understandable. They must think they will need them in the future and that they will be much more valuable a few years from now, otherwise they wouldn’t be accumulating and producing them like crazy. In the case of crude steel production, China’s production accounted for 53.3% of the world’s production in 2019 versus 46.6% in 2009. They have been ramping up production (probably in anticipation of a surge in demand), and I don’t want to bet against them because, so far, they seem to know what they’re doing.

**-India to increase CapEx spending**

Did you forget about India, the second-largest country by population size? New roads, new power grids, new rails, new pipelines, new housing, and new healthcare infrastructure are part of the Indian government’s plan to augment the country’s infrastructure as part of the Union Budget for 2021-22. Most of the country is still rural, and therefore lacks infrastructure, a problem the government is attempting to fix by increasing capital expenditure spending. Do you see what is going on? World leaders are killing 2 birds with one stone here. They are using infrastructure spending as a springboard to achieve post-pandemic economic recovery, thereby not only putting their economies back on their feet, but also addressing an issue that had to be dealt with anyway: a lack of new, modern, and greener infrastructure. This is wildly bullish on industrial metals if you ask me because other countries are likely to follow the same path.

**-Wealth Redistribution Policies**

Give a wealthy man a mil and he’ll invest it boomer dividend stocks like the rest of his 10 million dollars, since he already has a dream house, a dream car, and, unluckily for him, he can’t buy a dream wife on the open market, so in the meantime, he’ll strive to get richer. Give a wagie a mil and he’ll spend it faster than it takes a WSB degen to YOLO his paycheck on some 0dte FDs. The marginal propensity to consume of lower-income households is much higher than that of higher-income households, so because wealth redistribution effectively shifts income from investment to consumption, it is typically inflationary. Wealth redistribution has been part of the Democrats’ agenda for a long time and is also a component of the Covid Relief bill. Furthermore, with the likes of AOC gaining more and more traction among younger generations (AOC simps in particular), I can see these types of policies gain much more momentum in the future, given the current wealth gap is pretty abysmal and has the potential to cause social unrest if it is undealt with. And what about rising wages? I don’t think the $15 national minimum wage is going to materialize itself anytime soon, but there is nevertheless a push for wage raises undergoing (again, courtesy of the dems). This is, again, mainly beneficial to lower-income families and leads to a much more commodity-intensive economy, as a larger part of the population is able to afford housing, home appliances, automobiles, etc. than previously. This is obviously inflationary as well.

# Supply

\-**Low Capital Expenditure in the “Commodity Complex”**

This is a key component of the super-cycle thesis. What causes the rally in industrial metals is not only the sudden increase in demand but also the fact supply is unprepared. We know the industry that has been suffering from underinvestment for years and will unlikely be able to adjust to demand quickly enough. Since commodity prices started falling after the GFC, there’s been a dramatic decrease in capital expenditure for metal processing companies, miners, and industrials, as you would expect during a recession (add to that the manufacturing crisis). Furthermore, CapEx growth never came back to 2008 highs and has just been further dipping during the last decade, and even went negative following the pandemic adverse demand shock (in the case of steel for example). Producers had to outright cut back on investment just to keep their operating activities afloat. Although global capacity in industrial metals is still big enough to meet the demand today, given the state of the industry after the pandemic blow, I don’t think there will be overcapacity again like there was prior to 2019/2020, since the industry was momentarily weakened in the past months. This is precisely when prices tend to bottom, and then only does investment starts returning back into the industry, anticipating higher prices, and eventually margins improve when prices and the industry do recover, but with fewer players in it (**Chart 7** shows this cycle). I believe we are currently at the “Prices bottom” phase, and already we are seeing mining and metal processing stocks up. Investors are already expecting higher metal prices and profit margins, and investment is starting to flow back into the industry.

**Chart 7:** **Metals’ investment cycle**

# Bottom Line

""Listen, here's the deal"", we are about to have a manufacturing boom. There, I said it. Come at me bears! (except tech bears though). The US, China, and India are betting on huge infrastructure projects, and we're talking huge bets. Trillions. I believe the private sector is not gonna stand idle; they will follow and will also make massive manufacturing investments to turn around their businesses so they can be competitive in this new, high-tech, environmentally sustainable economy. This is big. As the demand for these types of massive investments goes up, interest rates will start increasing (this is not happening overnight, we're talking in a while), and then banks will be more than happy to lend at the right price (right now they just won't do it, they're not getting their risk's worth). Lending growth ✔️. As manufacturing starts rolling again, there will be more jobs and GDP growth ✔️. Full employment could very well happen, but realistically it will take more than a year; might still happen though. ""Overdrive mode""✔️. More employment means more income and with redistribution policies in place, more of that income will be spent back into the economy, driving prices up. Inflation✔️ Meanwhile, you have a metals' industry that is lagging the economy, as it did not receive the kinds of capital flows tech has enjoyed for a decade. Lack of raw materials supply ✔️. This generates a continued, multi-year, upward pressure on industrial metals prices. That's the super-cycle trade, investing where there is underinvestment in anticipation of the demand that's coming ahead. And look at it as an asymmetric bet, since you don't stand that much to lose with commodity prices this low. How much lower can they really get? And you know they'll rebound eventually, so you can double down if they dip again, and that's what makes the trade so interesting. Ask yourself, when the tech bubble pops, where is that money going to go? We've gone over this.

&#x200B;

# Hmm that's cool and all... but where are my tickers??

Ok, this is a Macro DD, it's in the title. I have not had the chance to take a deep dive into specific companies in order to find the hidden gems that will benefit the most from this (pls, if someone has done it, comment it in the thread that would be awesome). But if you want some tickers, I'll give you some. They can be broken down into categories. There's the steel sector (Steel Gang I got you fam), there's the Copper sector, and there's Silver (hey, there's industrial applications, and apparently there's already a fkg shortage so yeah, I'm adding it). I won't go into the specifics of the company, I'll just give you a quick overview of financials + valuation, so you'll have to put up *some* work yourself.

PS-I know there are other industrial metals such as Palladium, Platinum, Nickel, etc., but this DD is getting long af so I'll limit myself to just a few, but the super-cycle thesis is bullish on all industrial metals, so feel free to shoot other industrial metals tickers you are bullish on.

# Steel Sector

As I said before, 52% of all steel demand comes from infrastructure projects, so the fact governments around the world are investing like crazy in infrastructure is a think a good start for a steel rally. Steel gang knows all about it, and there's been DD on it, so go check it out, macro-wise, they're probably right.

Basically for the degens. Small-cap with low float, much weaker balance sheet than its peers, but with more room for growth. Trading currently 20% below ""fair value"" should you use a DCF model. I would say it's one of the most speculative plays in the steel sector, win big or lose big type of play.

**STLD**

https://preview.redd.it/eq7p6cngmph61.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=302c250198eff734be70ce80684eb738713d715a

Now, this is more reasonable. Rock-solid balance sheet, that pays a fkg dividend (Imagine caring about a dividend of 2.5% though lol) and is trading at an impressive 46% below ""fair value"", again using a simple DCF model (if anybody wants to add another way of valuing this shit please do, I suck at coming up with price targets, I'm just copying [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) estimates here). Won't probably move as fast as X though 😐.

Steel Gang knows this one well, and there's already DD on it, so go check it out.

**VALE**

Well, I stand with the Knights of Vale, and that is all I have to say. There's enough DD out there to confirm all of your biases, so I'll just say it's a good long-term play. Go read the DD.

**SLX**

VanEck Vectors ETF Trust Steel ETF. Honestly, I have never used it, it doesn't look very option liquid, so I wouldn't dip in it, but if you absolutely love ETFs there is one.

# Silver Sector

Let's not overlook silver's worth just because there's a ton of shilling going on. There are the people that believe the dollar will be worthless and the financial system will collapse, and then there are the people that legit think silver is a good commodity play. I think it's not only a good commodity play but also a good industrial play. As opposed to Gold, which is purely an inflation hedge at best, silver has actual industrial applications. Anyway, you know the tickers for silver, there's been more than enough shilling on them.

# Copper Sector

Copper, being an excellent electrical conductor, will likely have the most intense rally amongst metals in the coming years. The EV industry especially, but all other industries that will strive to go fully electrical and clean will demand huge quantities of it. Think of all the electrical wiring, revolutionary battery tech (like the one Elon showed on battery day \*PTSD sets in\*), as well as other industrial applications. For what it's worth, Goldman Sachs is most bullish on copper. Fun fact: Copper surfaces kill most viruses, including the Rona, faster than other surfaces like plastic. Do with that info what you will.

Now, this one makes me rock hard. Earnings are forecasted to grow 30% per year. On top of the huge growth prospects, it's currently undervalued at around 67%. 67%! And that's using the boomer valuation model that is DCF. Big value right here imo.

This one is a sexy beast. Excellent balance sheet, very good growth prospect, proven track record, and at a 55% discount using DCF model. But, of course, there's a but: it's only on the TSX, and while it has options, they don't look liquid at all. I'm a canuck so I can trade it, but yeah it's only on the Toronto Exchange...

**COPX**

It's the Copper ETF, and it has no options. Meh

Ok, so that's it for the tickers. To be honest, there are probably better ones, but I spent most of my time working on the overall macro thesis and wasn't planning to add any tickers initially and then changed my mind. Again, if you have suggestions please comment. These tickers are just the most popular and highest momentum names, they are not the hidden gems.

EDIT: Ok so I just had this idea by stumbling on somebody's comment just now. Somehow people think Biden is a warmonger. Well, the US hasn't had a good war in some time now. The Afghanistan war is still going on, not really going anywhere, and not being expensive enough to have any meaningful economic consequences. Meanwhile, tensions with Russia and China keep escalating. A war would be just about the last piece of the puzzle for the commodity super-cycle thesis. It would certainly cause massive inflation as demand for industrial metals and other commodities skyrockets, given the war effort resource reallocations. Historically, this is one of the conditions, so I think it's something to keep in mind going forward.

EDIT 2: wtf is going on with silver? All metals are up today 16/02/2021, silver and gold down. Gold I get it, silver I don't fkg get it. It has industrial applications, there is a current SHORTAGE??? Are people just not paying attention, is this just algos smacking the price down? I get the manipulation for silver futures, it's not new, but what about miners? AG and others... this is whack af. I'm doubling down on silver, it will come back to its senses eventually, it has too.

Ideas on trading Texas Freeze,18,lkruzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkruzk/ideas_on_trading_texas_freeze/,101,1613465783.0,"5 week old autist here

Before I say anything I just want to send my 🙏 to those of you that are riding out this crazy weather. I can't imagine how it must be right now with the cold and the rolling blackouts (especially if you have small children and pets). 

I talked about this before but I wanted to discuss it again. 

The artic weather that is hitting the central US will affect two commodities oil and natural gas. There are two commodities that are being affected by this, oil and natural gas. Of the two, natural gas is more susceptible to freeze offs. So for this discussion I will talking about natural gas. There are so many companies that encapsulate the natural gas market. They vary state by state and sometimes even county by county and right now I don't have the time or know how to explain all of them. So I will just focus on Texas (although Oklahoma was under the same situation). 

First I want to note the difference between spot and futures prices. spot is the price that a commodity is being bought **at the moment within hour time frames.** Futures price have a monthly time duration and will expire(they usually last a month). You do not see the spot prices as they are traded in specialized markets. The futures price can be traded with some brokers such as TD ameritrade. Due to the high level of autists and retards in WSB, I wouldn't recommend them unless you knew what you are doing ( too complicated and no good for those 💎👐). Here is an autisitic summary of what I see in the nat gas market. (horrible I know) any feed back will be much appreciated !

**Spot Prices:** This trade already happened normal prices are expected for the end of the week. This is also a specialized market that not everyone will be able to trade. 

**Future Prices:** Broke the $3.05 in the March contract **February contract expires 2/24/21.** If prices stay above 3.05 or higher expect prices to 🚀🚀🚀( there are calls for $4.00 but highly unlikely). Since these contracts have monthly expirations they lack the 💎👐 potential that many WSB seek. 

**Utilities:** Make money by forecasting power usage for next day correctly trading generation and surplus to competitors. If the utility had good forecasters they bought enough energy for themselves and where able to sell any surplus to competitors meaning they could have made large profits for the weekend. ( With the rolling blackouts across Texas only time will tell which utility came out on top). **Why are the Utilities implementing blackouts?**  They can't provide the power needed to supply everybody. Right now about half the Wind farms are frozen off and a third of the natural gas plants don't have natural gas to burn. 

**Pipeline companies**: If they are not frozen off they are running a full capacity right now. The only issue to figure out which one is frozen off. If you follow these companies ""force majeure"" means their pipeline is frozen off and they can't full fill their contract (not making money).   

**Producers**: If you hear ""force majeure**""** on a well they had to shut down the well due to a freeze off situation.  During the weekend some made a year's profit during the span of two days. Tomorrow there is going to be fireworks in the Futures prices. This will benefit the producers allowing them to lock in better prices for the rest of the year. Freeze offs not withstanding producers should walk away from this situation less debt and well positioned for the incoming demand boost during the summer. If this does not materialize exports will limit storage build up for next winter. Blackouts are shutting down Natural gas liquids plants meaning there is going to be a shortage of deliverable natural gas for a short period of time. 

**My suggestion:** There are literally hundreds of natural gas producing companies in Texas (no shit) my money is in Range Resources (RRC) due to high short float and high potential upside if futures prices rise. **Why this trade?** The spot price trade already happened you can't hold on forever on futures prices. If you want to buy a stock its going to have to be a natural gas producer, pipeline provider or utility ( there are other derivatives of course). But a producer has the added benefit that they will still be needed for summer with the added upside that futures price expectation from commodity traders is around $3.25 ( currently at $3.06)

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Buy natural gas producers such as RRC, they profited from cold and will have upside with the rise of futures prices.

"SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!🚀",7,lkq6wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkq6wm/silver_the_investment_that_has_no_risk_and/,94,1613460588.0,"Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:

Silver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)

How is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  ""About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group"". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. 

If the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!

BTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.

ATTENTION  **🌈🐻** :

Are your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.

Ok, now that the **🌈🐻** are interested, we can continue.

Time lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.

READ IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:

Silver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) 

Important sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. 

Conclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault! 

TL;DR: 

Is this really needed? Buy silver!!  🚀  🚀  🚀 (NOT SLV)

$T - AT&T Short Term Bull Thesis - Insider Trading Galore,853,lkpu79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpu79/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/,457,1613459558.0,"What's poppin' fellow degenerate gamblers. This is going to be my first attempt at writing DD in my entire fuckin life, so please, give it a read and let me know what you all think! I've attached a TLDR at the bottom for those who are a little retarded, and a TLDR of the TLDR for those who are illiterate.

&nbsp;


**__Background__**

What initially caught my eye about this entire play, was the [large influx of OTM call options being written for AT&T at the 30C and 30.5C strikes, dated for 03/05](https://imgur.com/vZLHCJ6). These contracts started popping up at the start of the month, and then exploded February 10th and 11th. What makes these calls so odd is the nature of AT&T; It's a boomer dividend stock. It experiences little to no volatility. It's a behemoth with an insanely large market cap. $T is extremely resilient to big moves, so why are so many options contracts so far OTM (*in relation to T*) being gobbled up? Someone with a deep pockets, and potentially a crystal ball, is betting insane amounts of money on $T to go above $30.5 (a roughly 6% increase at the time of writing) within the next three weeks.

&nbsp;

I had a few theories as to what may be going on, but was ultimately unsure of what to make of these unusual flows, so I decided to keep it at the back of my mind, and start to look for answers.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #1 : AST SpaceMobile__**

To those who don't know, SpaceMobile is the first and only space-based cellular broadband network able to be accessible by standard smartphones. SpaceMobile will effectively be able to provide both 4G and 5G connectivity to your phone ANYWHERE on the planet. AT&T has been in talks with AST about using their satellite network to provide 5G to their users, which I think is pretty nifty. Nothing has been confirmed yet, however, an FCC filing over the summer hinted at a commercial agreement. AST says that they plan on providing North American coverage for AT&T as early as ""Phase 2"" of their satellite launch. Overall, I think this is a pretty awesome deal, as the technology ensures that all AT&T cellular dead zones in North America would be effectively eliminated, making AT&T more attractive than it’s competitors in the consumer cell phone market. Could this warrant a jump in price? Absolutely.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #2 : 5G Airwave Auction__**

Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone, their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that *only it* has the license to use. Currently, there is an active auction (Auction 107) for air-wave licenses within the 5G spectrum band that has netted a record grand total of $81 billion dollars from various big players in the industry, such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. Bidding concluded on Friday, January 15th, with winning bidders having the opportunity to further bid for frequency-specific licenses in the assignment phase, which began on Monday, February 8, 2021. The larger the portion of 5G spectrum a company acquires, the better situated they'll be when 5G becomes the new normal standard among consumers. The performance jump from 5G is going to be so dramatic, that if carriers are not in that game they’re going to get left behind. On January 31st, it was revealed that once the assignment phase is completed in the *coming weeks*, the winners will be announced. Coincidentally, this lines up right before the expiration of these options, leading me to believe the call buyer(s) could be betting that AT&T won a large slice of the spectrum, easily warranting the needed 6% jump.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #3 : PLTR Partnership__**

Here is where things start to get a little spicy. It is rumored that PLTR and AT&T have signed a partnership agreement. As asinine as it sounds, these claims are easily backed up. PLTR and AT&T seem to have been in talks about collaborating for a bit, [as leaked by an employee on LinkedIn](https://i.redd.it/of9onix9izg61.png). The employee alludes to the fact that he was a key person in getting PLTR approved by the AT&T chief data office, with the timing and duration of his position reinforcing the fact that the contract is still fairly new. Furthermore, there have been a large magnitude of job postings from AT&T in Texas, that had PLTR as a high preferred / necessary qualification. This brings us to out next lead.

&nbsp;

Luxoft, a large Digital Strategy Consulting firm, has a newly posted Data Analyst role in Plano, Texas. [Some key takeaways from the posting](https://www.dice.com/jobs/detail/data-analyst-luxoft-usa-inc-plano-tx-75023/newageny/6846840) :

&nbsp;

• Our client is looking to Luxoft for help to scale the deployment timeline of a network ticketing and orchestration system into **five new centers**.

• This person would analyze Network operations center data via PowerBI and on the **Palantir platform**.

• Under ""Mandatory"" skills, there's **""Worked in Palantir or other big data analytics platforms""**

• Under ""Nice-to-have"" skills, there's **"" Experience in telecommunication industry""**

&nbsp;

So we know that Luxoft wants someone with PLTR experience, to scale and deploy some form of network into five new centres, in Plano, Texas. If we go to the Plano Economic Development website, [we find an incredibly important article](https://www.planotexas.org/269/ATT-launches-new-innovation-center-in-Pl). The key takeaway from it, is that :

&nbsp;

• ""**AT&T announced plans to open new innovation centers in Atlanta and Plano, Texas, to open in coming months, giving it a total of five such centers worldwide**""

&nbsp;

As a result, we can conclude that the undisclosed Luxoft client is AT&T, and that the new system they are looking to deploy across five new centers are the new AT&T innovation centers, the first of which is the one located in Plano, Texas, where all of the hiring is taking place. To top it all off, there was a recently posted position at AT&T, looking for people for their Professional [Advanced Analytics - Operations Transformation program, located in Plano, Texas](https://www.att.jobs/job/plano/professional-advanced-analytics-operations-transformation/117/18772894).

&nbsp;

Given Palantir’s meme power, and excitement for the future, a partnership could provide very beneficial to both companies, resulting in a swift upward trajectory to AT&Ts underlying price as well.

&nbsp;

**__Bearish Counterpoints__**

AT&T is under a mountain of debt (The most of any publicly traded company), and they're losing subscribers from DirectTV and cable faster than they projected, further adding to this issue. At the same time, for them to keep up with 5G, they're to pay additional billions in a spectrum auction and then need to pay many billions more to roll out 5G. From a financial standpoint, this is a massive red-flag, but with interest-rates still at 0, it is unlikely do be an immediate issue, especially with the shorter dated March contracts. Another thing to consider is that AT&T is a behemoth of a company. It's been trading in the 28$-30$ range since the dawn of time. PLTR Partnering with T may very well be akin to a fly landing on an aircraft carrier. Although its everyone's favorite meme stock with a promising future, the partnership may ultimately end up being negligible in the movement of AT&T's stock price. The same could be said for any of the above catalysts, so please, proceed with caution.

&nbsp;

**__Conclusion__**

With such a large number of potential catalysts, combined with the extremely cheap price of the contracts (10$ a pop at the time of writing), I feel like this offer is a little too good to pass up. Best case scenario, you hit a multi-bagger. Worst case scenario, you don't buy Wendy's for lunch on Wednesday and vow never to touch boomer stocks. I hope you all enjoyed this comprehensive DD on the unusual options flow of AT&T. If you would like to follow me for future DD, you can either DM me, or find my socials linked below in the comments, or on my profile :)

&nbsp;

**__TLDR__**

AT&T has been experiencing some insanely large magnitudes of unusual options flow. Whales are gobbling up $T 2021-03-05 C $30 and $30.5 like candy. This is likely due to them having insider information regarding one of the potential catalysts. AT&T  either partnered with AST SpaceMobile to eliminate cellular dead zones in their network, won the bidding war and managed to gain a favorable monopoly on the 5G airwave infrastructure, or partnered with none other than PLTR for an upcoming super project.

&nbsp;

**__TLDR of TLDR__**

• Buy **$T 2021-03-05 C $30** OR **$30.5**

"RKT DD Part II: A former employee's take on Rocket's Culture and how it will allow them to become the ""Amazon of financial services.""",392,lkpg7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/,288,1613458432.0,"**\*Disclaimer\*** this is a 15-minute read. I’ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focus on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.

In RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)

In RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.

The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket’s **company culture** – which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket’s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don’t view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.

In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket’s culture and researching Amazon’s – it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*

[https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)

Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon’s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon’s diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).

Rocket’s culture is based around 20 “ISMs” (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies’ values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company’s day-to-day norms.

Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **“ISMs day.”** ISMs day is a day-long seminar hosted by Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner for new employees to help them understand the deeper meaning of Rocket’s core values. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.

As a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket’s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army’s 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.

# “Every Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses”

Like AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer’s email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a “no return call complaint” (NRCC). No matter if you’ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days – if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, “…no exceptions, no excuses.”

My most memorable moment of **“every client every time no exception no excuses”** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident – he even CC’d Dan Gilbert. **That’s right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).

The former CEO didn’t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me – he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket’s guiding principles: **“every client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.”**

&#x200B;

# “It’s Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right”

All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company’s ISMs. It doesn’t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **“It’s not who is right, but what is right.”** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **“Every Second Counts” (another ISM).**

During my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket’s culture.

*“if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer’s phone call – let either of us know and we will call them for you,”* said Gilbert.

Of course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.

I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.

# “Ignore the Noise”

ISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult – but instead of listening to them, I would **“Ignore the noise,”** which is an ISM that means, ignore the “naysayers” and never let them stop you from success. There will always be noise in our lives – but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead.

I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult. They didn’t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life. Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled, so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built. The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit. We didn’t understand why people would bad-mouth a company who gave young, non-college educated kids the chance to make $20,000 a month in exchange for hard work. RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered, in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company (more on that later).

I also remember when **“ignore the noise”** was used against me. I complained to a co-worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me, he looked at me with an almost robot-like stare and said, “**ignore the noise,** man.” Rocket had programmed him; he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system.

# “We Are The They”

Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves. Any negative remark against the company, was a negative remark against the individual employee, which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult. **“We are the they”** was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one. **“We are the they”** means that there is no “they.” The “they” is all of us. “**We Are The They”**: One team. United. All in the mission together.

# Action-oriented ISMs (i.e. “Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped,” “we’ll figure it out,” “Every Second Counts”)

Rocket’s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM. Don’t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end, no decision was ever made? Rocket loves ideas. Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly (flat hierarchy) when you have an idea. But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above. At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every “t” and dot every “I” before launching a new innovative idea. If you did, progress would never be made – they emphasized that employees **“figure it out”** by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way. A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas.

It’s not just the customer-facing bankers that carry the ethos. Every. Single. Person. in the company, responds with a sense of urgency.

Now you “naysayers” might be asking how do I know if Rocket’s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company. I left Rocket in 2015, and I am now a supplier for them. I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer-facing bank force. They respond to my emails the quickest, out of any of my 400 customers. It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company, not just their sales team.

What happens if you are not on the ball? Simple: you are fired. This company is on the **lunatic fringe** of perfection. The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands, which is outlined in one of Amazon’s 14 leadership principles “Insist on the Highest Standards.”

# Who Does Rocket Hire and why?

Rocket hires anyone and everyone. Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs. He doesn’t care if you have a college degree, high school degree or neither – he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created. If not, they are fired at a moment’s notice.

His way of hiring non-college educated kids, who somewhat embody Detroit, is genius. The non-college educated, young 20-year old’s are given a second chance: a chance to make easily over 6-figures. Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them.

Non-college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones.

Why? Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does. Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies. They are the ambassadors of Dan’s ISMs.

# How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit?

These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee, but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work. Whenever I got bad service, I would become irritated. Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable. I didn’t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket’s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company. Its true: leaders either create a culture, or the culture will create itself.

Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency. In 2010, at the height of the recession, Detroit’s unemployment was 3x the national average. Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time. Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century. When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession, Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia, Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit.

I can’t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit. Everyone laughed at Dan’s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit – but Dan followed two ISMs **“Yes before no”** and **“you have to believe it to see it.”**

They doubted Dan’s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s, just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app, with no loan officer, in 2015. The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league (do you notice a trend?)

The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f\*\*ck the shorts who are driving down his stock.

They’re also now laughing at Dan’s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world. But Dan follows **“you have to believe it, to see it”** to the T. And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck.

Following the 2010 move, Detroit has become Rocket’s symbol – it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself.

The character of the city — its grit, resilience, and fortitude — gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder. This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market…both locally and beyond; and it’s quite powerful.

# Why is Rocket’s Culture important?

Rocket is more than a company; it is a belief system that unites 20,000 employees to a common goal. This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively – just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe.

Culture isn’t about what gets done, but how it gets done. Rocket’s belief system can apply to any industry, not just mortgages. That’s why Gilbert pounds into his employee’s heads:

*“it’s not what we do, it’s who we are that defines us.”*

It’s why Gilbert went public: he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options. He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today.

It’s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit. Yes, there's a part of this that is about community and altruism, but it is also about business. It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it’s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs. By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit (which he does), Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket’s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process.

I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company. But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket’s empire. Trust me, but as Dan Gilbert would say, you have to **“believe it, to see it.**

Gilbert's empire is just getting started.

*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 

&#x200B;

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

[chart from IBKR](https://preview.redd.it/1x6u00gl0qh61.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6a517d3b01e3f2a85380e6d2b058d160fb5335)

*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR 

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh 

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)

*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.

\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit

\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.

They sent a letter to Congress about retail investing and supporting small investors. 


The letter was a personal letter and listed some of the odd things that have happened with retail investment - especially with the GME activity. 


I saw the letter they sent - it wasn’t nasty or used dirty words. It was pretty professional and well researched (lots of facts and figures). It was only focused on retail trading and protecting private investors. It wasn’t threatening and just asked for Congress to take a serious look at things. 


Someone in Congress googled his name and found out where he worked and called his employer. The friend never once mentioned his employer or used his title or position. It was just a personal letter.  His boss had to talk to him about and just asked that he be aware how even sending a personal letter to Congress could come back to bite everyone in the ass. (His boss sounds pretty understanding.) 


My friend doesn’t want to talk to anyone about the letter now because he doesn’t want to lose his job. 


Be careful. You’re playing with powers where people will come after your jobs for voicing a concern.

Brief overview of why I like it.

&#x200B;

* Kratos has landed a bevy of recent contract wins and appears to be punching above its weight-class as compared to larger defense and aerospace companies.
* The company has a strong balance sheet and a strong backlog with a Q3 ending book-to-bill ratio of 1.8x.
* With a market cap of only $4 billion - and combined with leading edge drone and satellite communications technology - the company looks to be a ripe M&A target.
* Meantime, ARK Invest has been loading up on the stock and Kratos will likely be a core holding in the upcoming ARK Invest Space ETF.

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac  are two companies that are in conservatorship that have been retaining their earnings since September 2019.

&#x200B;

* Tesla’s net income in 2020 was $700 million. Fannie Mae is expected to exceed **$7 Billion**.
* Tesla has a market cap of $800 Billion. Fannie Mae has a **market cap of $2 Billion**.
   * Let that sink in for a moment. Fannie is 10X more profitable than the 5th largest company on the S&P500, yet only 1/400th of the value and trading OTC.
      * **Both $FNMA and $FMCC are less than $2!!! WTF!?**
      * What other companies trading in the OTC have quarterly earnings in the billions?
      * [Freddie Mac Nets $7.3 Billion in 2020, Strong 4Q](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/220515-strong-freddie-mac-nets-73-billion-in-2020-boosted-by-strong-4th-quarter?v=preview)

* The crime syndicate that is the US government is pulling off the biggest theft in the history of capitalism.
   * **I  own these stocks because I am fighting for what is right.  It is wrong for the government to hold these two public companies hostage; companies that never needed a bailout; companies that have already paid back the money they were forced to take.**
   * There are also UNSEALED documents showing the mafia-style bailout, which is evidence in the SCOTUS case.
* I think most people don't know about the 12/9/2020 SCOTUS case questioning a bid by shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pursue legal claims arising from the government’s rescue of the mortgage finance firms following the 2008 housing crisis. Yes, the case went to the supreme court! **Less than 100 days until SCOTUS decision.**
   * If we are lucky, then the ruling will come out before June 9, 2021.
      * The ""June"" date is set as the end-date of the summer adjournment; they should, probably will, clear their slate and pronounce before heading out.
      * Seems like April 1st is a middle-ground - they will of course be hearing cases in Feb, Mar, April, etc and those would get cleared out, as well.
      * Bottom line: Shorts do not have until June to play games. Longs can't be on the sidelines thinking nothing-happening until then either. **It could happen literally any day now.** 🚀🚀
      * Here is a [good summary of the SCOTUS arguments for the Collins vs Mnuchin case](https://www.lawfareblog.com/supreme-court-hears-oral-argument-collins-v-mnuchin)
* Fannie has a P/E and it’s less than 1. The company’s fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $4.6 billion, or $18.40 billion annualized. As of December 31, 2020, Fannie had 1.158 billion shares of common stock outstanding, but Treasury also holds warrants for another 4.6 billion shares, resulting in 5.76 billion fully diluted shares outstanding. Fannie’s fourth quarter earnings per share (annualized) thus are $3.19, which at today’s common stock price at this moment of $1.92 makes for a for a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 0.60...

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/opd8qiutdph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4bf46f2978e194792814abf31e84c3e19fa6632)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… 

# Big. 

# Fucking. 

# Deal. 

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). 

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a [Keyser Söze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5k73jx2mIc) position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. 

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpzxhuse5ph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e677cb560749bb8cbeeee1a64d4ac2a731ced48

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. 

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. 

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. 

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force 

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

[Palantir is the IL-ist SaaS on the market](https://preview.redd.it/eo8dcuir5ph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b2c02e0131256508c34eeb0c2cdaeb26bc2a2eb)

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon 
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals 

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/krrhl2b18ph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cd28bdbdab1e372fddb9a91002774fe44c0f900)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it. 

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5tuxd3v7ph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e0dc34fc3b59e2e308b1e2440c7b6d28a02bc3

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*   
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines. 

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets. 

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server? 

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce). 

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization. 
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock. 

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right. 

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right. 

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes. 

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you. 

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla. 

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell very many shares this more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news. 

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at [the restaurant at the end of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ig3X59_qA) PLTR gang!

24 HOURS UNTIL PLTR EARNINGS CALL IM GETTING SQUIRELLY. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE AND A SEX DEVIATE SIDE SHOW BOB LOOKALIKE WITH WATER SHOES HAS ALL THE CHIPS IN HIS CORNER: *A FANFICTION*,1531,lkmpxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkmpxe/24_hours_until_pltr_earnings_call_im_getting/,163,1613450754.0,"The man, the legend, the trendsetter and above all the hero in this time of strife, Alex Karp is the peoples hero.  I mean look at that hair, look at the shoes!  His style and grace has captivated virgins and autists internationally as news came that he loves to fuck his wife (only while her bf isn't around) non-stop and do Qigong.  This is the man we all aspire to be, every virgin cuck alive is jealous of his existence but, instead of being bitter, they respect him.

https://preview.redd.it/c8cxsgevdph61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=705244b531507e7c13755816ccf2e74fe8d1eae8

This is the new autistic face of North America everyone.  The hair, the water-shoes, all of these things factor into the earnings call coming up.  Ahead is some riveting DD/fan fiction I've put together, so take this post as a 2-4-1 deal on brain damage and retina damage while you can.

https://preview.redd.it/jtr9wy4ydph61.jpg?width=1465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb90d42a0c2dfdffedb7731e21f3564a40e4f81e

Since Karp is seen wearing inexpensive footwear mainly used in aquatic environments, I believe he is indeed a mammal (like you and I) except he is more of a marine species (my guess is seal or otter).  If my speculations are correct, then the leading short position holder of commodities related to water will get involved in this massive war between sea mammals and land mammals.  The man in question (leader of land mammals) is short seller Michael Burry.

https://preview.redd.it/916kzp40eph61.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6739fc49ab2a960fca12b05087419fe8035043a7

""Even his jacket is waterproof or has gills or whatever.  Who does he think he's fooling?  This guy is constantly being a cuck and I've had about enough of it.""  Burry expressed his feelings about Karp in a interview recently where he also added ""His hair resembles tentacles, I've seen enough hentai to know the difference between hair follicles and tentacles.  The guy thinks we are all oblivious.""   The interviewer could not get a single word edge wise as Burry continued to bash Karp relentlessly for his business model, hair, choice of footwear and marital status.  Burry continued to call Alex Karp's wife a whore and bash PLTR's business model senselessly.  While in between gasps for air, the interviewed shouted the words ""WATER SHOES"" which in turn, riled Burry up even more.  ""Those fucking water shoes, can't believe he wears those things.  Just wear flippers because your not fooling anyone!""

https://preview.redd.it/eu6me6r1eph61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dfb66a4e6a158b80844f88e2238d35439a69f8c

""Burry, that fool?  He is not even on my radar.""  Karp mentioned to a radio station recently.  When asked about the beef he began to rant about water preservation.  ""The world only has so much water and I'm going to hoard it all.""  He also snapped back at the comments made by Burry about his wife and said ""If my wife's a whore than his wife must have been the benchmark.""  He continued to call Burry's wife a ""foreigner"" a slew of racist stereotypes and epithets.  After approximately 9 minutes of slandering Burry's wife, he ended the interview with: ""Land mammals are really the weaker breed after my earnings call Tuesday they realize I am a superpower in this water gang shit.""  He hung up the phone interview on live radio without saying thank you or bye to the radio station, a true legend move.

Beating the Market - Part 1,1703,lkmerx,https://v.redd.it/br53983abph61,57,1613449888.0,,2021-02-16 06:31:28
"$OPEN - CHARTS LOOK GOOD, FUNDAMENTALS RIPPING",172,lkl6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkl6wl/open_charts_look_good_fundamentals_ripping/,97,1613446585.0,"TLDR - OpenDoor ($OPEN) is working to disrupt US real estate market transactions, and potentially mortgage underwriting. Strong tailwinds currently helping the business, including substantial increases in existing sales + home prices. Technical setup is strong even after last week's pop. Targeting $42-48 going into earnings on March 4th. Below are charts supporting our thesis. 

**Previous Posts**

[$OPEN - MASSIVE SETUP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/levsig/open_massive_setup/)

[$OPEN - DISRUPTING BOTH REAL ESTATE AND BANKING](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lchskm/open_disrupting_both_real_estate_and_banking/)

**Positions** \- Plan to roll Febs to Marchs on pop over $40

[Still holding OPEN. Technicals setting up for strong move going into earnings](https://preview.redd.it/c3213szihoh61.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=947e1d5bccdc78a17242e4586257bc3f852510d0)

OPEN is trading back in its l/t range after trading down due to a $700mn secondary issuance a few weeks ago. Chart points to a rising trend. If we maintain support and resistance, we are looking at a weekly range of $37 - $40.

[Daily OPEN chart](https://preview.redd.it/ueczwl97ioh61.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c971e6bc0d1cd05bf7464733df2c4d66bbe939)

The hourly chart reinforces this range. Good risk/reward at current levels given the rising trend line. Strong support at $34.50.

[OPEN hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/0a1dkkngjoh61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a756401d3a64fc8b13197df15f8a1353be9f79)

However, the aforementioned $37-$40 target range may be low as we have spotted a trading pattern between Zillow (Z) and OpenDoor which implies a price as high as $44 this week. As shown below, OPEN (multicolor) lags Z's stock (purple) and when we have seen gaps between Z and OPEN in the past, OPEN ends up ripping to catch up.

[Zillow \(purple\) vs OPEN \(multicolor\)](https://preview.redd.it/b9lxgswjkoh61.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=1401c76b7cdf27e171dda2fc3246492613f9e24d)

Home prices and sales were rising higher in the fall, and we expect this to continue for at least the next twelve months, assuming rates remain low. Existing home sales data will be reported on Friday, but we view lumber as a bellwether to US home sales (higher lumber prices = more demand = construction of new homes = short existing supply = sales + pricing strong). And lumber is ripping.

[Lumber prices](https://preview.redd.it/bkwtabw4toh61.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=338972df116a5269a3176bfecb64a33e5ed30236)

It also seems that OPEN's iBuying model is catching on, with Google trend searches for ""Opendoor"" moving higher at a steady clip. Most notably, the search volume is being driven by housing markets where OpenDoor is active. This data + housing sales data + the recent $700Mn raise suggest that the fundamentals of the business are heating up. 

[Searches for OpenDoor](https://preview.redd.it/7g8el49mmoh61.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=5030fa2cb78d0f014edcfdef646c66e9c3a88ee8)

Last but not least, we thought we would compare OPEN to PLTR. We have been analyzing OPEN's price action over the last several weeks and view it as being similar to PLTR in its early days of trading (when excluding OPEN's weak issuance trading).  We will see over the next week if OPEN will become wsb's new meme stock.

[OPEN tracking PLTR price action from early days](https://preview.redd.it/aut3ubsisoh61.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=3776e3fe29cbaec27e84e0ae00851424558f8b60)

We think that the technical story is strong and expect OPEN's business to accelerate in the current economic environment. While our trade is short-term, our analysis of the company suggests that OpenDoor has the potential to disrupt the real estate agent cabal (5% commissions) and mortgage/home equity underwriting cabal (money center banks). Let us know what you think.

First time:

Bought INTC at around March 2020 for a price of $51 per share. Idea back then was pandemic lockdown coming, everything was shifting online, 5G just started to popularize, thought that 5G & gaming could have a go. Was thinking among TSM, NVDA and INTC and finally chose TSM and INTC as the Big 2 Battle (really should have bought NVDA!).

Watched INTC climb to around $60 then this sucker announced in July 2020 it had to delay its 7nm production. Shares slumped to $47-$48. 23% loss over one week. Took it three months to finally climb back to over $52 in October 2020. Sold my shares with minor profits plus tiny bits of dividend.

Second time:

INTC had major reshuffling across Nov.2020 to January 2021 and the new CEO talked a good game. Thought that INTC had a bit of a ""catch-up"" play ahead. Re-entered INTC at around $58 in early January 2021. Saw the price climb to $62 on Jan.20 2021. Then some hacker hacked into the company's database and exposed part of the financial data and the company was forced to release 2020 Q4 reports early (not a great report anyway, net profit dropped 15% YoY). Took another two weeks for shares to recover to $60. Sold at $59. Again negligible profits.

Yes I did earn some breadcrumbs in these two trades but overall I consider it a loss since these two big ass black swans grabbed the big piece of bread from my hand.

But three times might be a charm. I am planning to enter INTC again and see if Karma is on my side this time.",2021-02-16 05:13:08

You may not believe me but I actually rote this post last week and then ran out the door before I hit send. Came back and accidentally hit refresh and lost all my thoughts or should i call them marbles? Anyway here is what I tried to write last week.

I am new to the jungle.. So new I don't even know what flair this should get. But I have been lurking and listening to my fellow apes. Hopefully I will be Joining you all soon. just waiting for the app to accept my money. So i can start kicking names and taking ass.

So on to my prediction. There are two assumption for this to pan out. First, the Hedges do not care about the failure to deliver penalties. Either the penalties are too low or they just don't think they will be penalised by the SEC.  Second, no third party will step in.. yes a shame but.  I suspect they won't. The only real threat to a Hedge is if another Hedge decides to make them bleed and comes to play and buys all the remaining shares.

Some of you have speculated this too... The Hedges will play the long game. They will buy low as they can and buy until it gets painful and then ladder attack down. This will continue with the aim to keep reducing the cost each week. each time they will bleed a little less. So this has happened twice in a row now. So I am even more confident.

Who knows, they may even be able to do this with out using the shorted stock. But I guess they will have to use some.

Do I think the court case will do anything? I can hope but I seriously doubt it.

Can we make money? Hell yes! Play the margins baby. play them hard. If we join and buy low/sell high with them. Then it will not only make us $$ but it will make them bleed for longer.

All you need to do is get a app with no brokerage fee. Yes they exist. I just don't have it. :(. I have gone for a regular buy and hold app. Which I am currently setting up. So i can roll in some hay too.

$CORN🌽🌽,942,lkixlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkixlh/corn/,464,1613440430.0,"**$CORN**

Let me introduce y’all retards to the wonderful world of commodities. 2021 is going to be a year like no other, we can expect this year for commodities to grow in value leading up to harvest in the fall rather then drop like they have in years past.

Why?

\-Corn prices ended in 2020 in a 6yr high of $4.80/bushel…+60% from august  of 2020

\-High demand for corn is coming from China due to their recent Hog population making a recovery from a swine flu.

\-Second to Ethanol, China is the leading factor for corn growth in the USA… soon to be the main reason.

\-China is estimated to import 16.5million mt of corn in 2021 compared to 7.6million mt in 2020. Also, important to note that in 2020 China only committed to 60,000mt of corn and ended up importing 7.6million mt. For 2021 CHINA HAS ALREADY COMMITED TO 11.6MILLION MT OF CORN. Yes, that’s right, they have already **committed** to import more corn than their total importation in 2020. Also keep in mind, thats just their commitment, the final amount will be <11.6 million mt of corn

\-US corn production estimates have also fallen \~9% from September to August (2020), not to mention year end corn stock estimated have fallen to a 7 year low of 43.23 million mt of corn.

\-Shrinking supplies of corn in the US, EU, Argentina and Ukraine will mean that corn prices will stay stable AT LEAST. Argentina and Ukraine have actually already suspended corn exports until March 2021… further boosting the price of corn.

\-The two main crops in the USA are soybeans and corn, analysts are predicting that more soybeans will be planted this year acre x acre compared to corn… further increasing the demand and price.

\-Last but not least, as I mentioned earlier the main biproduct of corn is ethanol, \~40% of corn production to be exact. With decreasing lockdowns and more vaccines getting distributed, more and more people will be active outdoors further increasing ethanol demand and usage. It is also important to note that one of the biproducts of ethanol production is DDGS, which are also shipped overseas to countries that cannot grow the proper feed for their cattle/hogs. DDGS are mixed in with the little food that these Asian countries grow so that proper nutrition can be met for their livestock.

A True Story About Diamond Hands,3203,lkigrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkigrq/a_true_story_about_diamond_hands/,214,1613439127.0,"Britbong here,

I have an interesting story to tell WSB today that i think my fellow 🦍 will find amusing if not inspiring. Ive just got back home from my wageslave job as a stonemason, where we make granite/quartz worktops for people considerably richer than we are. 

The story goes as follows: today was just like any other wagecuck day goes boring, monotonous grinding/polishing kitchen tops. At one point there was a really big island worktop, or ""countertop"" as our American brothers may say. These granite worktops can be really heavy under certain circumstances and today this particular one was and it took two of us to lift it to put a table underneath it to support the granite. 

On the way down, laying the granite on the table the third man moved the table too close to mine and my co workers fingers, or lets say hands. Now despite the pain of a couple hundred kg of granite trapping my hands between it and the table, I remained calm. Yet on the other hand my co worker quickly pulled his hands out from underneath as it crushed his fingers essentially tearing his fingers open from the metal table and sharp granite. Nothing major just a few cuts. However yours truly, as I've said: remained calm and simply stated my hands were stuck under the granite, so after a bit of panic fellow co-workers managed to lift the heavy granite off and there my fingers were. Intacted. 

It was almost as if you could suggest ones hand was made of some material made from intense pressure???

So, the moral of the story is when under pressure the key is to remain calm and keep your eyes on the end goal. Then make sure don't get distracted and throw yourself to panic as you can very much make the whole situation worse than it actually is.

Thoughts on Stonks: A rendition of George Carlin,55,lkicp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkicp4/thoughts_on_stonks_a_rendition_of_george_carlin/,20,1613438810.0,"**# of times mods have taken this down so far: 1**

A tribute to George Carlin's thoughts on germs (stonks) in America.

&#x200B;

They can fuck with you anytime they want. As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that's what Americans do now. They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling--the *illusion* of security. What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks.

There's another thing: stonks.

&#x200B;

Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country? Have you noticed this? The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks. Tesla, Hertz, AMC, Gamestop. And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks.

It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths. In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME. That's true.

Well they don't want you to lose any more money. And you can see their point. Wouldn't want some guy to go to hell and be poor. Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution.

Fear of stonks...why these fucking pussies. You can't even find a decent YOLO anymore. They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody's afraid of losing.

Hey where's your sense of adventure? Take a fucking chance will you? You know how many people lose all their tendies every year? 9,000 that's all. It's a minor risk! Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies.

Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for? They're for holding stonks! But they need practice. They need stonks to practice on.

So listen, if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you're holding you won't be prepared. And never mind ordinary FUD. What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit? I'll tell you what you're going to do--you're going to panic and you're going to sell at a loss. And you're going to deserve it because you're fucking weak and you’ve got fucking weak paper hands.

Alright, let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay. When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystocks that were going bankrupt. Okay? We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21, you know just because? And at that time the big fear was a market crash. Thousands of kids lost their tendies to market crashes. But you know something? In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash. NO ONE! EVER! You know why? because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTOCKS. It strengthened our diamond hands; the market never had a prayer! We were tempered in raw FUD!

So, personally I never take any special precautions against stonks.

I don't shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty.

I don't listen to anything on TV.

I don't listen to friends or family.

I don't take advice from billionaries.

And if one of my stonks drops 50% I double down and buy more of it. Even if the company is just a sidewalk cafe in *Calcutta*. The *poor* section. On New Year's morning during a soccer riot.

And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behavior...I never have losses.

I don't get them.

I don't get paper-hands.

I don't get FOMO.

I don't get stressed.

I don't buy into FUD.

You know why? Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice.

My diamond hands are equipped with SEC company updates, google trend indicators, and HQ sentiment analysis. And we have recently acquired positive EMA, daily supertrend, VWAP, and MACD. So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables...if they see any, ANY suspicious-looking stonks of any kind they don't fuck around. They whip out the DD, they buy the motherfucker, and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio. Into my portfolio. There's no nonsense. There's no Miranda warning. There's none of that three strikes and you're out bullshit. First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go.

Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don't automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large % of my portfolio. Okay? Can you deal with that? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. You know when sell my stonks? When I have to buy other stonks! That's the only time. And you know how often that happens? Tops TOPS...two maybe three times a week TOPS. Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean?

And I'll tell you something else my paper-handed friends. You don't always need to trade every day. Did you know that? It's overkill. Unless you work at a firm, or have 10 monitors at your disposal, or for some reason come in intimate contact with huge amounts of FUD and FOMO every day... you don't always need to trade.

I appreciate it thank you.

OPEN: Prospects and Thoughts?,57,lki99q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lki99q/open_prospects_and_thoughts/,37,1613438542.0,"Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) went public last October and had been quite a hit. I bought the stock on Monday (Feb.8) and it soared more than 27% by today (Feb.10). I sold some shares and am thinking if I should hold the rest for long-term profit of just cash in the rewards.

\-The company operates as an iBuyer of real estate properties, mostly residential properties. They allow property sellers to put in information of their properties and make online offers instantaneously, claiming that total expenditure of selling via Opendoor would be much cheaper than hiring a real estate agent. After purchase they will renovate the property and sell them online. They also offer home loans and refinancing of mortgages.

\-They currently offer services in 23 cities in USA, mostly in West Coast, Midwest, Central Atlantic and Southern states. The company claims it has serviced more than 80,000 home owners. The company sold more than 18,000 properties in 2019.

\-Revenue for 2019 reached $4.74 billion. Despite the pandemic, revenue in first three quarters of 2020 reached $2.3 billion and operating loss diminished by more than 34% to $119 million.

\- Catherine Wood's ARKW bought a lot of the stocks. As of Feb.3 the ETF holds approximately 4.24 million shares of OPEN (1.63% of ARKW portfolio).

My personal pros:

\-Online exchange of real estate properties only take up 1% of total property deals in USA. It could be the next big thing in online purchase like online car selling and buying.

\-The company pledges to expand its mortgage business and with the booming housing market due to low interest rates it could add to the company's operating incoming.

\-The company is yet to move into housing market in New England and Northeastern states and when they do it would be a lot more growth space for their business.

My personal cons:

\-The management has stated that the company might not turn profit until 2023. (That being said, it seems many popular stocks nowadays are attractive for their future prospects, not current profits)

\-The recent hype of the stock could be attributed to recent buyings of ARKW.

\-The company's current business mode depends heavily on huge cash flows to buy properties for cheap and provide mortgages. Sudden circumstance changes (failure of securing cash input, Fed raises interest rates, resurgence of pandemic, luekwarm economic recovery e.t.c.) could take a heavy toll on the company's business.",2021-02-16 03:22:22

GET OUT OF $SLV NOW IF YOU ARE LONG SILVER !,1463,lkgtyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/,550,1613434527.0,"[Video explaining what's going on](https://streamable.com/j3lgj5)

**I cannot stress it enough. Not only SLV is worthless paper, which is backed by...nothing, but it's actually used to SUPPRESS SILVER PRICES.**

I'll try to sum it up for retards :

* People buy SLV shares, making SLV buy silver and ship it to their vaults (sureeee...)
* Silver prices barely increase even though premiums are extremely high and bullion dealers are struggling to ship orders due to the massive demand.
* What's likely happening is that SLV didn't buy shit and is actually keeping your dollars...to guess what ? To buy silver when it's cheaper.
* But how is that called, when instead of buying something, you sell it and hope to buy it back at a lower price...mhm ? **That's right, shorting.**

# THAT'S FUCKING RIGHT. THEY MAY BE USING YOUR $SLV MONEY TO ACTUALLY SHORT SILVER. THEY'RE ACTING AGAINST YOUR INTEREST.

What ape do if silver go to moon ? Sell $SLV and then what buy?  🦍 ❓

* Safe bet : buying silver bullion. It's hard to find and you'll pay high premiums sadly. But it's the best way to actually make sure you have silver, because you're you're own bank. It's in your hands. This isn't a risky play at all.
* $PSLV (Sprott Physical Silver) is transparent on their silver and they show footage of delivery, etc. So it's actually backed by real silver. It's a closed end fund, which means they will not create new shares unless they take delivery of additional silver in their vaults.
* Buying miners shares. Now we're getting monkey YOLO. Junior miners tend to skyrocket when silver prices go up. They're a big leverage on silver prices. They can easily go 200% or so. 🚀 🚀
* Buying junior miners options. Very high IV, but the ultimate monkey play. Leveraging the fucking lever ! Extremely risky but extremely rewarding. 🚀

&#x200B;

This isn't financial advice of any sort. I'm not qualified to give any. I don't have tangible proof that SLV is doing that but neither do they have any fucking proof that they've been buying silver, especially since the price haven't skyrocketed like they should. **Silver, unlike gold, is a TIGHT market.**

Relevant positions : $SA and around 37 lbs of silver coins + 3 oz of gold in my pirate chest. Planning to buy calls on $SILJ as a small yolo play.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Disclaimer : lots of junior miners are penny stocks and therefore not allowed to be posted on WSB.

We know the risk, We know the greeks, we know the logistics.. 

But is there something we don't know? The most important part of the equation is ""Implied Volatility""... WHO TF KNOWS HOW TO CALCULATE VOLATILITY. It's not a black scholes formula it's a black hole.

Do we really know Fischer Black, or  Myron Scholes, or Bob Merton? These dudes won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, The most controversial of Nobel Prizes, one that many say ol Al Nobel wouldve never wanted. WHY?

 And then why is this a rule? ""information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.""

Why would they win a global recognition trophy for this formula? In my opinion.. I think its a formula that always creates an upward trend or more so creates an irresistible illusion birthed from institutions holding shares.  

I personally believe the whole market is being Squeezed UP by option contracts.  I believe i've seen companies go bankrupt because of over traded options or corrupt option models. (MDR is only one of my suspicions)

Supposedly, according to seekalpha ""**Trading** in **options** is truly a side play and has no **affect** on supply and demand for **shares**, among either **buyers** or sellers.""  

BUT to write an option you have to own the shares and to own the shares there has to be a **supply** and if I want the shares then there's **demand.**

Full RAVI trading instructions (99% safe),71,lkfozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkfozt/full_ravi_trading_instructions_99_safe/,86,1613431164.0,"As promised, I'm posting this full step-by-step guide on how to get the easiest tendies in your life with RAVI indicator, with all the steps and requirements for 99% secure 2% YOLOs. I will test this myself tomorrow and **upload full results**

# Requierements:

1. **Volatile stocks only**. No, you can't trade NIO or PLTR with this shit, forget about it
2. Respectable volume. If a stock looks like it had less attention than your dad at his graduation prom, don't use this indicator. The bigger the volume, the better
3. Consistent volume. RAVI breaks if it sees a huge long term volume spike, and needs to be ignored for some time (further detail below)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/orohgybernh61.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7bda1bb383b3446c8e4bd7955c70a01a799f7c3

**! A Stock can be volatile today and barren tomorrow. Always check for news !**

# How to entry:

\- Once you turn on RAVI, pay attention to the white lines (there is literally nothing else but white lines)

\- Once one of the white lines becomes red, you go long

\- Once one of the white lines becomes green, you go short

Sometimes there will be multiple colored lines in a row. Don't be scared, this is normal, and because of that there are two ways to decide on the size of the trade.

\- If you are a sane person, invest 25% of your account on the first colored line. If there is another colored line before you profit, double your investment. If after that there is a third colored line, double it again, investing a 100% of your account.

**This isn't Martingale betting strategy**, if there are two colored lines it doesn't mean that your first trade failed. It just means that doubling on the second line increases your profit, and sometimes avoids breaking even

\- If you are retarded, YOLO on the first candle. It is slightly less safe, but you will, on average, have greater profits. It depends on your risk management to either choose the careful approach or go full retard. Both work well however

\- A compromise strategy is to invest 50% on first, and the other 50% on second candle, usually the most profitable and safe

&#x200B;

[ Entry strategy example, illustrated ](https://preview.redd.it/5k8xjs8jrnh61.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee563778b2b6a8ec009538d6ac3542da7531841)

(!) If you see a stock with little to no volume have huge volume on the next day opening, or in the middle of the day, you **must** ignore RAVI for about 40-50 minutes, or else you will inevitably lose money. RAVI takes volume into account for calculations, and massive volume spikes makes it go autistic and recommend losing trades. Same goes the other way, a stock with huge volume yesterday and tiny volume today isn't a good option for trading RAVI.

# If RAVI fires too often:

Sometimes RAVI will give signals way too often. If there is good volume and volatility, most of these signals will still be correct, but you have a rare chance of small money loss:

&#x200B;

[ As you can see,in an overall uptrend, RAVI still nails the majority of the trades for 2-5&#37; profit, but there are a few mistakes with minor 1-1.5&#37; losses, and one case of breaking even ](https://preview.redd.it/vn8256cqrnh61.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=e866ada3a728e8fbeffb277e801d19c26861c3cc)

# How to exit:

\- Usually exit strategies are what breaks otherwise great indicators, but not in the case of this one. Since RAVI is so accurate and safe, holding trades is actually a good idea.

\- Once you go in, wait for a 2-3% profit, and then **EXIT.** This is the safest way of getting consistent profits.

\- If there is a huge 5% move happening within 1 single candle, hold, and exit once the candle finishes.

\- If the trade is being negative for more than 10 candles, exit for a loss. It is rare as you can see, but it still happens. The losses are however greatly compensated by an overwhelming majority of good trades that pay off the losing ones.

# I will test this method myself on Tuesday. I am very confident in my calculations, but this is WSB, and I have unironic untreated ADHD

Yes, the method works on paper, but I want to test it myself tomorrow before any of you autists launch yourself in and lose money. **DON'T** try it yourself until I do. As I already said, I will post results with both numbers and a video

Also:

1. This might look similar to RSI since they both take volume into account, but they are different. RSI has a much lower accuracy, and is often silent while RAVI suggests a succesful trade.
2. There are multiple versions of RAVI, most of them suck dick. I personally use the one on etoro. To access it, create a free empty account, then go to watchlists, click on a chart icon under any ticker, a chart will open. Switch to 1 minute chart, click on the crayon symbol (not the pencil), go to Studies II > RAVI > Don't touch anything, click 'create'. You can trade on your own broker while looking at an etoro chart. Some people also suggested that Yahoo Finance has it, but I'm too lazy to check
3. All of the advice and general method is created from data based on many different tickers that meet the criteria, not just 1 or 2.",2021-02-16 01:19:24
"Some background on $HIMS, a branded telehealth company offering 🍆 pills, and why I'm super bullish",259,lkfm5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkfm5a/some_background_on_hims_a_branded_telehealth/,190,1613430915.0,"I hate nothing more than the market being closed on a Monday so here's some solid DD to outlet my frustration:

$HIMS is a branded telehealth company focusing on personal care products for both men and women. It originally started as a provider of pills for your balding head or limping noodle cock but has expanded into offerings for dermatology, mental health psychiatric's and women's care products as well. Basically, millennials and Gen Z don't like talking to their doctor and would rather order personal care products via online consultation to avoid awkward subjects, ie. balding and limp dick. The reason we give as shit is that Oaktree Capital, led by the famed investor Howard Marks, recently led a SPAC to merge with $HIMS and the ticker changed over just a few weeks ago. Peter Thiel and Alex Rodriguez also happen to be early investors. Has anyone seen the JLo ads? Cathie also couldn't resist and piled some shares into her ARK genomics ETF just recently. Smart people have clearly done the deep dive on this and left hungry to invest. 

I had to do my own DD of course so I tried getting prescribed ED pills via Hims. Now I'm a healthy college student but no one can turn down some recreational dick inflation. I was surprised by how seamless and fast the experience on its interface was, and the pills worked just as advertised. If every guy can do this, I can't see why Hims can't grow into a $20 billion market cap on this alone. Its financials have been nothing less than impressive with 91% YoY revenue growth and 71% gross margin, in line with what an attractive Saas company would typically have. It also has a substantially growing subscription base at 250,000, with average purchase amounts steadily rising. Telehealth is obviously a sector about to undergo massive growth in the U.S, with $TDOC and $AMWL leading in this space and providing the infrastructure to connect with your personal primary care provider. $HIMS is differentiated by its branded offerings, aggressive advertising and high-margin product categories which are direct to consumer, without insurance middlemen for now. Expanding into diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea and primary care product categories will supercharge this investment thesis. At $22, it's a few dollars down from a recent high a $25 but the real catalyst is earnings being announced on 3/18. All indications point towards a blowout earnings past management's typically conservative guidance. I'm long 15k in shares, 10k in $25 3/19 calls and 10k in $25 in 5/21 calls.
