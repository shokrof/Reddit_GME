Early this morning I saw a news article from Tesla that they had invested in a certain company. I can’t mention in this post because auto mods take it down. So long story short, as retail investors, everyday we are manipulated, played and our accounts wiped clean from shorts.  Hedge funds are killing our calls and puts and using shorting to ruin our portfolios.  When we go to fight back we are restrained by the very companies we use to buy our portfolios.  This system is rife with corruption.  We can’t win against the big hedge funds, but there is a way to make them pay and that’s to not  even play.  If we all jumped into the BC and EU like Tesla did yesterday, we can push the price to infinity. It’s the new revolution for the new investors.  Forget about calls, puts and stocks.  It’s time to move on to bigger and better things that can’t be manipulated . And that’s Why it was created.  Bigger returns, less stress, and backed by our boy!! As long as you are not weak with volatility you will be more successful in the future of this revolution.  Tell me I’m wrong. Btw watch the bots and the shorts comment on this, it will be fun.",2021-02-09 01:36:34

Is the optimism towards GME and AMC still realistic? I mean I am holding because like most I am at a loss and feel that I have nothing left to lose.,213,lfdxv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdxv2/is_the_optimism_towards_gme_and_amc_still/,180,1612826280.0,"As much as I appreciate the optimism of this group that GME and AMC will go to the moon and beyond, I wonder sometimes if it is just blind optimism that keeps a lot of us hopeful that it would do so.

I have lost about $4500 which was a big chunk of my savings and blame nobody but myself for gambling on the stock market and the gamble didn't payoff.

"While you were busy arguing about GME, I studied the blade. Daddy Elon is using it. Mommy C. Wood is buying it. Grandpa Gamma wants to squeeze it. You need to try it.",16,lfdlla,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdlla/while_you_were_busy_arguing_about_gme_i_studied/,54,1612825332.0,"What is ‘the blade’ you ask? It is the sword that we live and die by. It is the ultimate high-risk, high-reward investment.

What if I told you that there’s a single company, currently valued at **0.01** trillion dollars, that has an actual possibility to grow into a **1.02** trillion dollar market cap company?

Let’s look at the companies it can steal money from:

* It’s a social media replacement. FB is worth 763 billion.

* It’s a Zoom replacement. ZM is worth 122 billion.

* It’s a podcaster’s paradise. SPOT is worth 58 billion.

* It’s a personal trainer platform. PTON is worth 43 billion.

* It’s a dating app platform. MTCH (maker of tinder) is worth 42 billion.

* It’s a language learning platform. Rosetta Stone and Duolingo are worth about 1.4 billion.

Add that all up and you get **1.0294 trillion dollars.** That’s 100x the company’s current value. Will it get all the way there? I don’t know. This isn’t WallStreetFinancialAdvice.

Oh, I forgot:

* They also do telemedicine or some shit (literally worth an arm and a leg).

What company are we talking about? Agora (ticker: API).

Do you remember when Gmail was invite-only? You should have invested in GOOG back then.

Do you remember when FB was invite-only? You should have invested in FB back then.

Guess what’s invite-only now? Clubhouse. That’s the app that Elon Musk used to roast Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. It’s a platform for audio-only chatrooms. It can’t effectively be described with text—you have to try it. Did you ever marry someone because of her tinder bio description? (the answer is no. hopefully. some things just can't be explained via text.)

I saw some articles about Clubhouse a couple days ago, and I thought “yeah yeah whatever. New social media thing. I was a Facebook guy, never got the hype about Snapchat, now lots of people are moving away from Snapchat, I bet this Clubhouse thing will pass too.”

Holy fuck I was wrong. There’s really nothing I can write about Clubhouse to make you think it’s good. You just have to try it. **Anyone else who has used the app, please comment below with your honest review.**

The nice thing about the app is that it just fucking works—no lag, no choppy audio, no bullshit. It’s just effortless. Zoom, Discord, Skype, and all their competitors suck a big fat donkey dick compared to Clubhouse. 

I literally use Clubhouse 16+ hours per day. My girlfriend fucking hates it.

But Clubhouse is ackshuallllly just a User Interface. The true magic sauce in this tasty tendie basket is the audio-processing platform. Agora (API) makes this software, and they charge Clubhouse a certain rate per 1000 minutes of use.

Think about that for a minute. The more you use Clubhouse (yes, you! the person reading this!) the higher Agora’s revenue goes, and the higher Agora’s stock price will go for its stockholders (again! this could be you! You could be a stockholder!).

This is like buying Xboxes at GameStop, except you don’t have to buy anything, you just have to use a fun app (which you are going to get addicted to anyway).

API has Clubhouse by the balls. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY would use Clubhouse if it was laggy, choppy, or full of microphone issues. API is the rainmaker, the money printer, and the rocket fueller. There’s a gold rush right now and API patented the fucking pickaxe. Maybe a competitor can match them. Maybe Bing will be better than Google some day. Who knows.

Using the platform for the first time feels like you’ve been living in a 56k dialup world, downloading “Mr. Wilson from Castaway” themed porn (frame by frame), when suddenly the clouds part and the two co-founders of Agora (both named Tony) hand you a StarLink-powered 8k Jumbotron pre-loaded with Mia Khalifa’s greatest hits and the new Spongebob movie: Sponge on the Run.

It’s good shit. 

It’s addictive. Do a web search (yes, do a web search with “google,” that search engine that you should have invested in back in 2006) for a graph of the user growth. Clubhouse’s membership is literally exploding faster than WSB’s members did during peak GameStop mania. You are going to be reading a LOT of articles about Clubhouse in the next few months. You don’t wanna be fucking late.

That said, you’re not early to the party. The stock gained $50 last week, closing around $100. All call strikes were ITM. They’re making new strikes up to $135. There’s a serious chance that these strikes could expire ITM as well, yielding a gamma squeeze. It's up about 8% right now. no big deal.

This party could go on a long time. The market cap is only $10 bn right now. Back when Google was a 10bn company, if you had invested $10k, you would have $1,420,000.00 now.

Yes, I just compared API to Google. Why? Because tech matters. Google was just a search engine back in the early 2000’s. It grew because it was the best search engine. Agora makes audio processing platforms. It is BY FAR the best. Work from home is here to stay. Audio is fucking important.

Clubhouse might stick around, or it might be the next MySpace, idk. But whatever audio-chatroom app takes their place will have to pay Agora to use the audio processing software. Cha-ching. (Oh, and Agora’s voice and video platforms work in a million other industries too, like telemedicine, which might be useful since there’s a pandemic).

Cathie Woods threw a fuckton of money at Agora shares to get them in her ARKW etf. Additionally, unusual options trackers noticed that some big fat whale bought a fuckton of calls with the highest strike, $135. Some very smart people like the stock.

Do your own research, don’t gamble more than you’re willing to lose, and try out the Clubhouse app for yourself. It’s invite-only right now but you can join the waiting list and it might let you join in a couple days. It’s iPhone only right now.

Again—if you’ve used Clubhouse, please post a review below. And if you have questions or concerns about Agora (API) post them below as well—I get all my info from the internet and I want to know if I missed something.",2021-02-09 01:02:12

Now there have been a lot of posts talking about why the short interest is still going to be substantial.  I believe on Jan 15th the percentage was something above 80% shorted shares of the outstanding shares.  Since then, the media and hedges have been doing everything they can to drive the price down.  It is blatantly obvious...

For the last few days, GME has seemed to hit a wall at around that $50-60 range.  Which means they are struggling to drive it down further even with the manipulation.  I think the second part of the squeeze is imminent.

PSA: Fidelity accounts (prevent GME/AMC shares from being shorted!!),1688,lfgxhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfgxhz/psa_fidelity_accounts_prevent_gmeamc_shares_from/,162,1612834320.0,"Fam,

Just spent 30 minutes on the line with Fidelity. Bottom line: if you have a **MARGIN** account with level 3 or 4 options approval, **THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES**.

However, you can request that they **DO NOT** lend *specific shares*, or even *all of your shares*. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.

Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are **NOT** being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.

Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be ""un-shortable."" This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.

I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.

Not financial advice / I like the stock / GME & AMC to the 🌖🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548. Don't tell them I sent you ;)

Edit 2: tighten the fucking noose on the shorts. If you're on other brokerages - call them and post the how-to for others. Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy's supply lines. You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Edit 3: I'll hold your hand all the way.... click the tab Accounts & Trade > Account Features > Brokerage & Trading > Options. That will show you your options levels. Tighten the grip! 🐍

Edit 4: hard to quantify, but if **ALL OF YOU** call your brokerage and cut off the lending of shares it will have a major positive affect on the GME share price.... let's call it a ""synthetic"" buy order to further help the short squeeze.

TDC 5x immediate upside,251,lfcgn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcgn2/tdc_5x_immediate_upside/,148,1612821934.0,"Hey Lads, I've been lurking on here since 2016, and today I bring you TDC.

I think Teradata (TDC) has 5x immediate upside. I could post some more in-depth DD, but I 'm trying to get this idea posted before market open so anyone who wants to can get in before the massive ripper. I think the following cuts to the chase

I was lucky enough to pitch this shitco to an investment club in college back in 2014. At the time, TDC was being disrupted by Hadoop/the cloud and all signs pointed to the slow death of this legacy data warehousing business. My idea was basically laughed off the floor and the club didn't buy, and honestly I couldn't blame them in hindsight. I followed this business for the next 7 years and saw it ripped 30% last week, and is now up 11% in premarket.

Apparently, TDC has managed to launch a cloud-based data warehousing alternative to Snowflake. This business segment just achieved $100 million in annual recurring cloud-based revenues, with yoy growth of 100%+. This compares to Snowflakes \~$400 million, which is also growing at triple digits. I would say that TDC is a pretty serious competitive threat to SNOW at this size.

SNOW is valued at 175x sales (\~90 billion market cap), and TDC is valued at 1.6x sales ($3 billion market cap). If you were to slap a 170x revenue multiple on TDC's emerging cloud business, it would be worth $17 billion, up from $3 billion this morning.

TDC has about 20% short interest just received a buy rating from BofA. The squeeze has already started and the stock is up  37% on the week, but I believe we are in the early innings of a 500% ripper. Major sellside analysts are starting to upgrade the stock.

Unlike GME, which is a dinosaur facing two asteroids (death of the mall, death of physical game discs) TDC is a recovering shitco with an extremely attractive cloud business that is going to compete directly with SNOW. There are some very attractive quality underpinnings to this trade - i.e. this isn't a pump and dump, it's a classic turnaround that could rip past $100 this month.

I'm buying weeklies on open, see you fellas on the moon

Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview,18009,lfyzh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfyzh5/cramer_is_working_hard_to_take_down_videos_of_his/,687,1612892354.0,"Plenty of you degenerates have seen the interview from 2006 where Jim Cramer talks about about stock manipulation being a ""fun game"" from his hedge fund days. He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. What does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.

All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

Everyone have a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.

EDIT: Here is a transcript of first 2 minutes 40 seconds of the interview if you can't watch the video (in comments). It goes on for another 8 but this should be enough for your ape attention spans:

**A:** Welcome to Wallstreet Confidential, I'm Aaron Tass(?), joined again by Jim Cramer. Jim, Welcome

**Cramer:** Good to see ya.

**A:** Thanks for being here. Uh, so, economic data out today but wanna talk about something else first. Again today we have the misdirection from the futures. The futures pointing up in market. as of right now it's actually down again. Is this just because it's the holiday period that we're seeing this?

**Cramer:** You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund, and I was position short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money. Similarly, or if I were long and wanted to make things a little bit rosy, I would go and take a bunch of stocks and make sure they were higher. Maybe commit 5 million in capital to do it and I could effect it. What you're seeing now is probably a bigger market, maybe you need 10 million to knock the stuff down. But it's a fun game, and it's a lucrative game. You can move it up and then fade it, that often creates a very negative feel. So let's say you take a longer term view intra-day and you say listen, I'm gonna boost the futures and when the real sellers comes in I'm gonna knock it down and it's gonna create a negative view. That's a strategy very worth doing. When you're valuing on a day to day basis. I would encourage anyone who's in a hedge fund to do it, because it's legal. And it uh, is a very quick way to make money. And very satisfying. And by the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that but I don't care. And I can't - I'm not gonna say it on TV.

**A:** There's so many more hedge funds today than when you were managing yours. Do you think that exacerbates the moves or makes it tougher?

**Cramer:** Well, you know, the hedge funds are positioned long-short. They're not just long like mutual funds. So it's really vital these next 6 days cuz of your pay day, you really gotta control the market. You can't let it lift. When you've got research in motion(?) it's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down because it's the fulcrum of the market today. So let's say I were short, what I would do is I would hit a lot of guys with RIM, now you can't foment. That's a violation of, of..

**A:** Ferment? (lol)

**Cramer:** Yeah, you can't FOment. You can't create, yourself, an impression that a stock's down. But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it. So, I mean that's the only sense I would say this is illegal. But a hedge fund not up a lot really has to do a lot to save itself. So, this is different from what I was talking about in the beginning where I'd be buying the Q's and stuff. This is actually just blatantly illegal. But when you have 6 days and your company may be in doubt because you're down, I think it's really important to foment if I were one of these guys.

5. They get squeezed by the balls AGAIN - this time they won't be able to make 100 million synthetic shares to cover their stupid corrupt bottoms 📉

Extra Dumb Question about AMC,252,lfiug0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiug0/extra_dumb_question_about_amc/,178,1612839346.0,"Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

Feel free to tell me why I'm stupid.

The game is rigged but 💎✊✊✊ can still win!,979,lfxpvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxpvy/the_game_is_rigged_but_can_still_win/,170,1612886447.0," 

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options,748,lfix74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfix74/boring_but_useful_information_for_new_traders/,63,1612839557.0," 

I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.

First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.

Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.

1. FlowAlgo[ https://flowalgo.com/](https://flowalgo.com/)
2. TitanFlow[ https://titanflow.io/](https://titanflow.io/)
3. Cheddar Flow[ https://www.cheddarflow.com/](https://www.cheddarflow.com/)
4. OptionsFlow[ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adm.optionsflow) (Website is broken I think)

Apps

TitanFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50

TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.

Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

OptionsFlow

Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20

This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.

Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it’s better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

Websites

FlowAlgo

Cost Per Month: $150

I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

CheddarFlow

Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99

If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow’s main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps.",2021-02-09 04:59:17

Post is under approval and is not online yet. Let's hope a Mod will approve it ASAP.   
Hi all,

Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.

First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.

I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.

**Okay here we go:**

I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.

**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week’s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.

**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dtl7ekf7t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=939fb0f1be41f22db8691e0988faaba30274826c

First observations:

\- 2020 amazing year.

\- Dip Q3 2019.

\- Good year 2018

\- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.

\- Bad year 2016, again something changed.

Please note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:

Observation: High P/E value compared to competitors. Large market cap, higher ROE.

\- Stock price stays above MA-Simple (50) line despite any dips (Positive)

\- Growth in P/E ratio (Negative)

**Step 3, Seasonality analysis.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e1nmgmq9t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=75d62f28870c051cec2f9f8d8c13a79e671288ab

\- February has on average been a strong month. So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).

**Step 4, Ownership.**

**Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better. We don’t look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.**

&#x200B;

Observations:

\- Strong buy by CEO Mr. Badrinarayanan on the 28th on Jan. 2021.

\- Strong sell by Sunpower Corp. (not representative)

\- Strong buy Blackrock Fund Advisors on 31th Dec. 2020.

\- Strong buy Blackrock Advisors (UK) on 31th Dec. 2020.

**Step 5, Ratio analysis.**

**Why was 2016 & 2017 such a bad year?**

Ubiquiti – UI – Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout,41,lfduai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfduai/ubiquiti_ui_momentum_stock_with_potential_short/,20,1612825999.0,"Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

**TL;DR** Ubiquiti $UI is a position to add to your portfolio based on it fundamentals, momentum and the possibility of a short squeeze that could be a moon shot based on the small float and ongoing share repurchase program.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21

Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program.

The game is rigged but 💎✊✊✊ can still win!,1556,lfdmhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdmhk/the_game_is_rigged_but_can_still_win/,234,1612825398.0,"Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???",2021-02-09 01:03:18

Hate Hedge Funds & Wall Street - Why Not End Them All?

With so many users on WSB, there are many point of views about Wall Street and the market.  However, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes Hedge Funds and the big players who have trampled over retail investors to make a living.  

Considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be ""invested"" in the stock market. The problem is the financial system and Wall Street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  Even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $GME, it eventually works in their benefit.  The value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.  

The Financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the Gold Standard(which had problems due to Bretton Woods) and 1977 amendment of the Federal Reserve Act.  Ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the Federal Reserve's mandate of ""maximum employment"" causes Fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  Ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and Congress.  Wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really the.1%), and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  Again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  This structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  If you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.  Pestakeholder.org has a report titled Pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had ""suffered"" almost 600k job losses! 

The monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  They have more power than Congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  The Federal Reserve is just an extension of Wall Street - the NYFED is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank CEOs or members of their board.  These people are responsible for bank supervision...  

I saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $GME position.. It was titled: ""This is for you, Dad"". They were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  Their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. Along with millions of Americans.  

The Federal Reserve has created an economy for the Big Banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  In fact, the Office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you FOUR banks control 155 TRILLION of the derivative market while ALL OTHER BANKS control 23 trillion.  

The 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... Try 16 trillion(Google GAO audit) or 29 trillion(Link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  The Fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and AIG.  These emergency facilties were managed by... WALL STREET.  In fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given ""non-competitively"" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  The Fed can just say these are ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" to bypass that.  They paid Blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  I think PIMCO was over 100 million too.  Then BofA and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  The banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  They received trillions in lending by the Fed - Citigroup had the highest total at 2.6 trillion.  They literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the Feds balance sheet.  It took the Fed 10 years to unload all of their ""Maiden Lane"" MBS purchases.  

Present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations. 

From Wallstreetonparade.com 
""If the Fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans. After reading the F-SOC revelation, we searched the New York Fed’s website for hours to see if it had ever made a public statement that it was going dark on the dollar amounts of its repo loans. We finally found this statement dated June 11, 2020:

“Beginning with this month’s release, the Desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business day’s operational details.”


The Fed's cumulative loans from Sep 2019 to mid March 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  Half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  However, as WSOP points out from the F-SOC the big banks are currently using 2.5 trillion of loans.  These are typically overnight or a few days. 

None of this is transparent because the NYFED is a corporation and is not subjected to FOIA - The board of Fed is but I tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the NYFED conducts the lending and facilties.  So, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(Board) of government.  




Alright, I could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. Let's get to the point.  

The only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  The only way to achieve that is to stop using Dollars... Also practically impossible.  However, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  It's imperative.  Investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems IF many people actually committed to this.  If a few percent of Americans did this the banks would have huge problems.  

Nothing is going to change until we address the Federal Reserve.  Anything less is just a *game that won't *stop the pillaging of avg Americans from this industry.

Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC,3659,lfcpce,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/,341,1612822682.0,"I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout ""market manipulation"" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff

Here's the email he received.

&#x200B;

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

""Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn’t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn’t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I’ll resolve your ticket but I’m still here if you reply.""

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

His post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

And for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

So their excuse is a ""programming error"". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).

Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.

UPDATE: CLOSED MY POSITION

So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,249,lffnz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lffnz6/february_pharma_bets_for_gambling_degenerates/,165,1612831024.0,"For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,432,lff0y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,93,1612829287.0,"I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

“SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!”

“YEEAHHH!” -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",2021-02-09 02:08:07

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn’t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB 🚀 💎 🚀. For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven’t fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you’re like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don’t expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

Robinhood colluding with Citadel to halt buying of meme stocks isn't the most likely scenario - and other comments,30,lfe7rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe7rn/robinhood_colluding_with_citadel_to_halt_buying/,119,1612827052.0,"Can go here if you want to see the other side: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf75c4/reminder\_of\_what\_actually\_happened\_with\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf75c4/reminder_of_what_actually_happened_with_gme/)

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)",2021-02-09 01:30:52
Is there a difference between the GME squeeze and AMC squeeze. And is it possible to maybe save one?,122,lfe5ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe5ql/is_there_a_difference_between_the_gme_squeeze_and/,192,1612826894.0,So I am a smooth brained ape who got into the squeeze without fully understanding it like most. Now I am not trying to pursued anyone to doing anything but I was wondering if it was possible to to get some traction again by doing something desperate... So I know I will get stoned for this but what if we just focused all our efforts on AMC. What if we all moved out position to AMC I was thinking considering the price difference we could still make some significant volume changes if we all moved positions. To be clear I am in both GME and AMC but personally I believe AMC is the safer bet in the long rung with or without the possible squeeze. So what if all us Ape just focus on getting AMC to the moon. Would it be possible to start beating the hedge funds again?,2021-02-09 01:28:14

Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650€ - a measly 1.25 shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work.

Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,0,lfla1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,51,1612845681.0,"Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to 💎🙌 when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",2021-02-09 06:41:21

Genuine Question- Do You Feel You Can Make Money Investing?,142,lfk73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfk73n/genuine_question_do_you_feel_you_can_make_money/,173,1612842870.0,"I don’t want to sound like r/investing, but I was surprised at how many new comers seem to believe the stock market is literally rigged against them... that just isn’t the case.

I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. He was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. He tried this on other outlets but was always told “that’s too risky” “most stock pickers underperform” “you are better off buying index funds”. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

If you came here because you thought GameStop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. We take big risks here, but again, we know they’re risky and we know what we should be doing— in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you’ve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it’s how most people are able to retire these days. 

Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang). You should know your risks before you come in with your nihilistic outlook and try to protest hedge funds by taking the losing end of their trades.",2021-02-09 05:54:30

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?

The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,113,lfj2k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfj2k0/the_bull_case_for_clne_a_stepping_stone_to_the/,60,1612839918.0,"This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. I still think CLNE is a strong play and will be adding to my positions.",2021-02-09 05:05:18

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it’s a good stock are exact reason why it’s a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

How to read DD on WSB.,785,lfi3va,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,70,1612837388.0,"So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",2021-02-09 04:23:08

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi  
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi  
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her  
Both up state for attempted murder

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. Don't put in what you can't risk to lose; it isn't worth it.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  “shocking rules"" — rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

I wanted to include as many pictures in my DDs as you guys have chromosomes so please...

TLDR - refer to the end of the Google doc above.

Edit: this stock will be at least a 6 bagger 10 years from now. That said, we don’t know how long the tutes will control RKT. It may be safer to buy RKT shares and RKT calls that expire in June or later. You guys will make money on this trade trust me - just don’t be greedy and go for weeklies; making money off those is far from guaranteed.

Double edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1B buyback (that cuts RKT’s float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - RKT could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align. And if it doesn’t squeeze, this shit is still going to melt up. You’re not investing in fucking bed bath and beyond here.",2021-02-09 12:21:12
"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should",2645,lfs22f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/,579,1612865338.0,"When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People’s Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

**$SKLZ Comparison To Upcoming US Esports Streaming Platform**

Visit their website for the love of your unborn child [https://www.skillz.com/](https://www.skillz.com/)

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

# Are they making good money?

EPS (TTM) is 116.69, it's actually earning A LOT OF money compared to GME (GUH). I found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my GME shares lol.

# How do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?

Let's see how many PCR machines they sell compared to others. IMO, it further highlights how absurdly discounted Bio-Rad is compared to other suppliers.

[These are from Thomas.net, an unbiased source talking about finding suppliers for various industries. See bio-rad on #9 top supplier.

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

>Three suppliers dominate the citations. They are Thermo Fisher, **Bio-Rad** (including brand MJ Research) 🚀🚀 and Roche. The most cited models are Thermo Fisher 7x000 series, iCycler/MyIQ from **Bio-Rad** 🚀🚀, and LightCycler from Roche.

Why Altria ($MO) LEAPs may have HUGE asymmetric upside 🚀🚀🚀,247,lfqbrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,147,1612859834.0,"**TL;DR: vaping, marijuana, Michael Burry, low as fuck IV, hugely under-valued company 🚀🚀🚀**

  


*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping “there’s almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.” [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don’t want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",2021-02-09 10:37:14

Let’s face it, GME isn’t going to the moon anytime soon. The short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share IOUs as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. And since the stock isn’t paying dividends, and the company’s revenue is going down the toilet, there’s really no big downside to them doing so. Maybe Ryan Cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.

Anyways I’d like to see this sub return to its roots. Ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about GME. Anyone else agree? There’s more stocks to invest in than GME, many of them more promising and with higher upside.

QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,482,lfpzz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,433,1612858805.0,"A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like – you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride – but make it sensible.",2021-02-09 10:20:05
"There’s a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)",771,lfpkl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,157,1612857533.0,"Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there’s a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the 🌈🐻’s. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren’t buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay “inflated” prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let’s say it’s 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn’t done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don’t go parabolic and are considered “safe” they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that’s because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it’s raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there’s more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it’s moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn’t believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn’t trigger this thing alone. We don’t have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren’t nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I’m rooting for y’all but mechanically it’s a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn’t financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",2021-02-09 09:58:53

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

Since seeing the GME thing build up through the front page, I've been following your mission and for the last couple of weeks noticed Robinhood ads popping up and usually with a large number of awards attached. 

1) is just browsing your posts really enough to get targeted?

2) who do they think they're trying to fool?

3) is it just me or did these ads appear around the same time the class action was submitted (and is there any news on that)?

Thank you all for the quarantine entertainment.",2021-02-09 08:01:28

The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.  Oh and the people being critical of you trying to pump GME a second time, the ones you call shills?  Those are usually WSB vets.

But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.

And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls. 

Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.

Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down... 

Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value! 

So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!

(CLNE)** 🚀🚀🚀

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) 🚀🚀🚀

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

&#x200B;

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[Dr. Gordana R. from Children's Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596)

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity.

Only reason I am asking is bc CS owns TD Ameritrade and I don't know if that could cause any issues in the future (reeling from my Robinhood Burn, hence my concern)

The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,31,lflob4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflob4/the_solution_to_the_robinhood_problem/,20,1612846731.0,"Okay Smoothie Brains, I’ll make this short because I know you apes won’t read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn’t keep up.  Something like that, I don’t really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don’t have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That’s what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can’t make promises because I an amateur and I’m not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I’m just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

There are many so called brokers and apps that only sell CFDs such as eToro etc.

If you buy a CFD from, say, eToro or equivalent you will not impact any short squeeze scenario since the actual asset (share) is not owned by you and where applicable you will not be entitled to any share dividends either. 

If you want to help impact the market please ensure you are actually buying the stock you are bidding for. CFDs are just a form of spread betting.

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years.

Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market',175,lfz6ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfz6ar/reddit_doubles_valuation_to_6b_as_it_raises_money/,31,1612893253.0,"Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),6878,lfxux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxux0/stuff_for_new_traders_no_gme_discussion/,666,1612887066.0,"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

Q1 earnings report is early April and I bet it will be ugly. Options are only trading in monthlies but the Jun 2021 puts are looking like a super cheap gamble right now.  Tell me why I’m wrong.

CVS- 10% of Michael Burry's portfolio and why it is in mine,1391,lfvg9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfvg9b/cvs_10_of_michael_burrys_portfolio_and_why_it_is/,335,1612876982.0,"  

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there… eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS… 

Well, I couldn’t believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven’t done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven’t. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn’t need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like “Oh wow, my wife’s boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring”.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don’t believe in the F word. 

· According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it’s fair value

· PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

· Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

· Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

· \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

· Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

· Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

· Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‘in house’ offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

· Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

· BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

· State Street $3.4B (4%)

· Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

· Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon’s disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

· Aetna – Health Insurance plans 

· Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

· CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

· Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It’s not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

· High Ownership from mutual Funds

· 10% of Michael Burry’s portfolio

· Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

· In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) 

\- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward

TDC - deeper DD as promised,236,lfulsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfulsm/tdc_deeper_dd_as_promised/,174,1612873883.0,"**TLDR**; TDC is a better Snowflake worth $70 to $300.

It is not ""the new Snowflake."" Snowflake is like Goldilocks in this scenario - it quickly developed a cloud-based  product (within 2012-2014) and stole some business from TDC...now TDC is back with a superior cloud offering, and it's about to kick Goldilocks out of its house.

**Investment Case**

Teradata is a data warehousing business (almost exactly like Snowflake). They briefly lost the crown to Snowflake (innovator's dilemma) in 2014, when they failed to pivot to the cloud...but that has all changed as of a few days ago.

The company shocked investors last week by reporting a massively-successful new cloud biz (see last week's earnings release [here](https://s23.q4cdn.com/501457330/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/TDC-4Q20-Earnings-Release-(1).pdf)).  **Teradata Vantage (established top-notch tech, now available in the cloud) posted $100+ million in revenues last year, at a 160% growth rate**. This is in direct competition with Snowflake, a $90 billion business **with only $450 million in revenues**. Not only that, but research suggests that Teradata Vantage is far superior to Snowflake (see below). The company's CEO even suggests that **they are stealing business back from Snowflake**. TDC stock is worth $70 in the immediate near-term, possibly $150-300 if valued like Snowflake.

**TDC is NOT an emerging disruptor**. This is an established, 40-year pioneer in data warehousing. These guys led the way for decades and are now deploying their already-developed, superior (more scalable) tech to the cloud to displace Snowflake and take back the crown.

Either Snowflake is not worth $90 billion, or Teradata is...

&#x200B;

**Overview**

Teradata is an enterprise data warehousing business, i.e. TDC enables customers/businesses to access/manage data, generate insights, and use these findings to make informed decisions.

**Data Warehousing Industry / Tailwinds**

* Data warehousing is the process of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing data. Pretty catch-all phrase but this is a catch-all business, fam. It applies to literally everything.
* Companies use data warehousing software to acquire, aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources (different geographies, business units, etc).
* Analytical services are layered on to help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions
* Total addressable market is $81 billion, according to Snowflake in 2020.
   * Snowflake’s S-1 filing: “...the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which we believe we address, will have a combined value of **$56 billion by the end of 2020 and $84 billion by the end of 2023.**”
   * That’s an industry-wide CAGR of \~15%

**Company History**

TDC was a pioneer in data warehousing. The company launched in 1979 and developed a cutting edge relational database platform by 1984. TDC was acquired by AT&T (NCR) in the early 90’s, and created the world’s first 1TB database system for Walmart in 1992. In 1996, it spun off from AT&T in ‘96 as NCR Corp. TDC spun off from NCR in 2007 as an independent company and the largest standalone data warehousing biz. So 40+ years of experience in data warehousing.

Chief Technology Officer Stephen Brobst has been involved in some shape or form since the NCR days in the early 90's. He has been CTO since 1999. In 2014, Brobst was ranked the top 4th CTO in the US - yea up there with Tesla and Amazon CTO's ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teradata-executive-stephen-brobst-named-one-of-top-four-chief-technology-officers-in-us-276001651.html)). Brobst is clearly a visionary and top mind in the business.

TDC was historically focused on the legacy server construct. Back then, the thought of a utility-like public cloud (AWS) becoming the industry standard was laughable. Companies ran their own servers and relied on on-prem solutions. TDC deployed on-prem database software, servers, analytical software and related consulting services.

TDC was a well-known name in the business world; in 2008, customers included Coca-Cola, FedEx, Wells Fargo and a long list of other boomer stocks. Historically, IBM and Oracle were listed as top competitors. Pre 2014, Teradata was considered THE data warehousing leader (ahead of ORCL, IBM) by Gartner. Today, its cloud product is back at the top (yes, above Snowflake, see below).

Over the years TDC shifted focus from the legacy data warehousing business to upselling big data analytics and marketing solutions. This was the investment case in \~2013 when I pitched the stock to my college investment club (shoutout CIG). However, TDC’s legacy offering wasn’t well-suited for the cloud, which was starting to gain a lot of hype and traction. This rustled everyone’s jimmies and TDC started to collapse from 2012-2014, when Snowflake launched its cloud-based offering and started stealing market share. Emerging tech like Hadoop and Amazon’s AWS native offering (Redshift) were also major threats.

So there you have it, TDC was king of the “data warehousing” hill, failed to pivot to the cloud, lost to Snowflake and was in decline...until now.

**TDC today**

Teradata has rebranded itself as a “hybrid cloud analytics software provider,” meaning it can run its database software (Teradata Vantage) on-prem, in the public cloud, private cloud or all of the above. Literally exactly what Snowflake does, perhaps even better (more on that later).

TDC was purpose-built for complex queries. The company spent the past 40+ years leading/ innovating and accumulating 600+ patents. This IP is the result of massive spending and effort over the years - the result was a company that eventually enjoyed 25% cash flow returns on capital before Snowflake went and punched them in the balls. Now TDC is coming back with a vengeance.

TDC Vantage is a fixed-cost, scalable software platform. The company is basically taking decades of research and refined technique, and migrating it to the cloud. R&D has already been spent and TDC claims to be multiple years ahead of Snowflake (see below). Now it just needs to move this IP to the cloud and print cash.

The company is now run by CEO Steve McMillan, who previously tried to compete against TDC at IBM (19 years) and Oracle...and failed (his own admission, see article below). McMillan was brought in to turn the company around after it failed under previous leadership to pivot to the cloud. Now, he  is executing better than anyone expected.

Last week, TDC shocked investors when it broke out cloud-based annual recurring revenues (ARRs) of $100 million, up 160% from a year prior. This was the first mention of their success in the cloud and a surprise to longs and shorts alike.

In the most recent earnings call, sell-side analysts were glowing:

**Cloud Implications**

* Cloud-based subscriptions are cheap to deploy. They don’t involve massive up-front costs to acquire a perpetual license/on-prem deployment. For those that don't know, this is like subscribing to Netflix vs. buying movies yourself. the former is much cheaper up-front.
* TDC users pay based on their computing needs, so revenues are NOT recognized ratably like other SaaS stocks. Revenues are recognized as customers compute, so revenue growth is directly tied to the volume of usage of the platform. This is a VERY attractive business model and effectively a toll bridge on cloud computing.
* TDC’s legacy on-prem business **WAS** lumpy because of the large upfront cost, which resulted in long sales cycles and required executive/CEO-level approvals to complete a sale. New cloud-based offering is lower-cost up front and easier to sell. This will enable shorter sales cycles and faster growth.
* Large scale data warehousing requires a lot of human touch/tailoring. TDC is very experienced in helping big businesses with these large database transitions. They have a solid consulting business purpose-built for this. These consultants didn’t get stupid overnight - TDC can leverage its years of experience to offer a more tailored experience vs. Snowflake, which has only been doing this for 6 years and doesn’t have a massive consulting effort.
* While TDC has been in decline for years, it’s bled customers at a slower-than expected pace. This is because many TDC customers spent a shit load of money upfront to integrate their business data on TDC databases. These customers still fork over $1.5 billion to TDC per year - they will probably be converted over to the cloud-based offering (which results in more attractive economics and earnings visibility). This last part is a crucial aspect of the valuation (below).

**Competitive Advantages**

* *Network effects*: as customers move data to the cloud, the more easily data can be exchanged between customers that share the same platform
   * Snowflake cited this as a competitive advantage, it applies to TDC as well
* *High switching costs*: adopting a large database is a time consuming process that is also a pain in the ass. Once complete, people don’t want to leave. This is evident in TDC customer retention even in spite of cloud disruptions.
* *Cost savings*: data insights result in cost savings for the customer. this is the difference between life and death of business these days
* *Intellectual Property*: Decades’ worth of IP (600+ patents) and reputation as an industry pioneer

**\*\*\*\* Competitive Positioning \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (READ THIS IF YOU READ ANYTHING AT ALL)**

Not only is TDC pivoting to the cloud to survive, but research suggests that it might even be better than Snowflake.

In a recent interview, CEO Steve McMillan said the following

>“I’m going to say a couple things that will surprise some people,” he says. “I think our 40-year heritage in helping organizations get the best out of their data \[gives us\] a set of experiences and a set of capabilities and a set of technology advances that ***Snowflake are going to have to take a long time to catch up with us***\*.\*“Look, if you want to set up a simple data mart with a little bit of DSS \[decision support systems\], Snowflake is going to work fine for you,” McMillan continues. “For companies that want to operate at enterprise scale–and I haven’t met a small company that doesn’t want to be a big company–and they want to operate at scale in a really cost-effective way, ***Teradata is a better choice than Snowflake.”***

He goes a step further

>“We have differentiation that we think is ***four or five years ahead where Snowflake*** \[is\] in terms of things like workload management and data governance and some of the core, deep SQL engine capabilities that we have in our product that just aren’t replicated inside Snowflake,”

And the finale

>“When we see customers making that transition, making that migration to cloud, they’ve not been able to get the same level of performance and scale, either from the native cloud providers or the likes of Snowflake, in terms of just operating at that level of scale and consistency,” McMillan says. “So it’s really interesting as we double down on the \[cloud\] message and we’ve taken it back to ***customers who may have moved off Teradata and tried these cloud providers, we’re seeing those workloads start to come back to Teradata in the cloud***.”

**\*\*\*\*\* IN OTHER WORDS, MCMILLAN SUGGESTS THAT TDC IS STEALING CUSTOMERS BACK FROM SNOWFLAKE. THIS IS HUGE. (LINK BELOW) \*\*\*\*\***

Gartner also suggests that Teradata Vantage is superior to Snowflake in every use case:

* Gartner scored Teradata higher than Snowflake in every use case of its Cloud Database Management Systems
   * [https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases](https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases)
* Teradata Vantage was listed as a market leader ahead of snowflake in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems:

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

*Snowflake (SNOW)*

* Snowflake IPO’d in 2020 at an \~$80 billion valuation. They claim that they are chasing an $80 billion end market (annually), which has people excited, and rightfully so - this is a pretty exciting time for cloud-based data analytics.
* In the trailing 4 quarters, Snowflake posted $480 million in revenues. The stock trades at $300, or an $80 billion market cap. This implies a \~160x price-to-sales ratio (which is frankly ridiculous imo).
* During its first earnings call, SNOW reported 119% revenue growth

*Teradata (TDC)*

* As of close (2/8/21), TDC was a $5.3 billion company.
* In its earnings report last week, TDC reported that its emerging public cloud business reached $106 million in annual recurring revenues, up 165% from a year prior...this is ape shit growth. The type that rustles people’s jimmies.
* TDC is guiding for another 160% increase in Q1 2021, and a 100% increase in FY 2021.
* In total TDC reported $1.4 billion of recurring revenue, most of this is the legacy business.
* Before the earnings announcement, which caught Wall Street/Snowflake investors off guard, TDC was valued at $2.7 billion - so it’s fair to say this is what the legacy business is worth. This is your valuation floor.
* At 160x revenues (what Snowflake is being valued at), TDC’s public cloud business is worth $17 billion. I’d also point out (again) that TDC is a 40-year innovator here and is rated higher than Snowflake by Gartner in all use-case categories.
* Now, I think it’s fair to say that in growing the cloud business, TDC is going to convert legacy customers from the on-prem solution to the public cloud solution. If it converts another $100 million of its $1.5 billion to the cloud biz, that’s another $17 billion valuation. Now we’re looking at a $34 billion business.
* 34 billion / 5.3 billion = 6.4x upside

**Price Targets**

* Base case: $7 billion ($64 stock price). This is below JMP’s recent price target ($70). At $7 billion, TDC’s cloud biz would be valued at $4.3 billion (43x revenues, or 75% lower than SNOW's valuation).
* Bull case: $17 billion ($155 stock price). At this level, TDC’s public cloud biz would be valued at 170x revenues (same as SNOW).
* Moon case: $34 billion ($300+ stock price). At this price, TDC’s public cloud biz would get the same valuation as SNOW, but we would also value another $100 million of revenues at 170x revenues, which would represent future conversions from the company’s existing legacy customer base to the cloud-native solution.

**Near-term catalysts**

* Recent earnings results shocked investors in a positive way, but not all of the gains have been made. It takes the average buyside investor 2 weeks to complete DD, so we're still getting ahead of the big money here.
* TDC has 20% short interest, so 1 in 5 shares are sold short. These shorts are going to cover ASAP because the recent earnings report was nothing short of transformative. TDC never broke out its cloud-based annual recurring revenues until last week - this basically killed the short thesis and turned TDC from a deep value stock into an aggressive cloud-based saas business overnight.
* People are realizing that TDC was a hidden gem and is the cheapest way to play the parabolic growth market of cloud-based data warehousing/analytics. (see yesterday's Barron’s [article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teradata-rally-continues-as-investors-discover-a-cheap-cloud-software-play-51612823248?siteid=yhoof2))
* Given the massive valuation spread between SNOW and TDC, and the apparent technological superiority of TDC, we could be on the right side of a popular hedge fund pair trade (long TDC, short SNOW). This wouldn't be a bad trade if you guys want some risk-adjusted tendies

&#x200B;

**2/11/2021 Update**: For those that need to focus on a valuation floor, try and look at TDC as a sum of the parts:

We know the legacy business is worth $3 billion. TDC was a $3 billion stock before management broke out the cloud revenues last week. 

So depending on how much you think the cloud business is worth, here is what the stock is worth

$47 per share or $5.1 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 20x sales)     

$66 per share or $7.2 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $4.2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 40x sales)     

$76 per share or $8.3 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $5.3 billion (TDC Cloud @ 60x sales)     

$105 per share or $11.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $8.5 billion (TDC Cloud @ 80x sales)     

$125 per share or $13.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $10.6 billion (TDC Cloud @ 100x sales)     

$190 per share or $21 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $18 billion (TDC Cloud @ 170x sales)     

&#x200B;

Compare that to other somewhat related cloud stocks: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x),  DDOG (60x).

So if you value the cloud biz at less than half of the cheapest above peer (21.5x), then the stock is worth $48. If it's valued at the same level as the cheapest peer (MDB @ 43x) then we're looking at a $70 stock.  

Hang in there and be patient.

It’s become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, “this is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.” So with that said I’m making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‘how to use options’ section. 

People claiming “sHoRtS hAvEn’T cOvErEd YeT” despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I’m going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)—the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.﻿ Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)—heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point—starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding. Congrats, you just played yourself and have brought shame to your family, your village and all of China.",2021-02-09 14:08:00

FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,1094,lfttp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfttp8/free_money_alert_5_on_semiconductor_on_40c_exp_416/,398,1612871189.0,"Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don’t want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I’m a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi’s it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I’d call a great options deal. 

Note: I don’t provide sell points, so don’t ask. Every post I’ve made provides the opportunity to make money, it won’t change with ON, don’t be to greedy, and take your free money once it’s there.",2021-02-09 13:46:29
I believe Qualcomm will recover,97,lftq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lftq2y/i_believe_qualcomm_will_recover/,55,1612870853.0,"This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I’ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you’d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)
