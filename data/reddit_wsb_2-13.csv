>Thu, Feb 11, 7:33 PMHi \*\*\*\*\*\*,  
>  
>It is a question we receive a lot, so here are my candid, and somewhat long-winded, thoughts:  
>  
>These concerns typically are raised by North American investors versus UK based investors, which I believe at a base level is due to geography and familiarity: North American investors will willing invest in mining companies in South America, while UK investors prefer investing in Africa and shun South America.  
>  
>I have to say, after many years in this business, I am on the side of UK investors. South America has a long track record of governments imposing new royalties and taxation regimes (let alone nationalization) on mining, while Africa – or more importantly, the right regions of Africa – should be considered among the most desirable regions for investing in mining in the world.  
>  
>A key phrase above is “the right regions in Africa”, as for an investor to be “apprehensive to invest in mining in Africa” is almost akin to an investor saying they are “apprehensive of investing in mining in the Americas”. There is no doubt there are countries in Africa that are questionable, but West Africa has a long established history now of being very pro-mining. I believe it has been 40 years since one of the countries, Ghana, returned from a 15 year experiment of nationalization that failed as mining output cratered – as mining is a people-intensive business that requires skills and capital.  
>  
>If you look at the recent history, countries in West Africa like Burkina Faso, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, and Senegal have profited immensely from mining and since adopting commercial mining codes that reflect internationally accepted standards (in Mali’s case 30 years ago), this has resulted in significant foreign investment in the gold sector and gold tax receipts to the governments. The fact is that mining is a critical backbone of these economies, and if you look at the history there is very little of what you see in South America. Governments, and more importantly, local communities are very welcoming of mining (done the right way by companies that adhere to first world environmental standards).  
>  
>In Burkina Faso, where our producing Yaramoko mine is, mining revenue contributes approximately 16% of the total government revenue. This is poor country that relies on the income of mining and the skills and career development that come with it. Generally in mining, for every $1 generated by mining an additional $3+ are generated elsewhere in the economy, so the impact of mining to these economies are even higher. Therefore, it stands to reason that these countries would not want to rock the boat – which is all fine and well when saying that – but you can look at their track records to see this is put into practice.  
>  
>Our Yaramoko mine, from initial drill hole to production, was 5 years. There is nowhere else in the world that you can see projects move ahead this quickly. Our next mine, Séguéla, which will be coming online next year (\~4 years from initial resource) and which has the potential to more than double our production and cash flow – without having to raise a share since we can fund it from our operations – received its Environmental Approval in September last year and the Mining Permit in December. This will be one of the highest grade open pit mines in Africa, and as a testament to the government and local communities buy-in, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) approved the mine in 8 months. This is not because we cut any corners, as we adhere to IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles, but the government and people want these projects. Notably, when we acquired the project in April 2019 from Newcrest, the mining minister of Burkina Faso wrote to their equal in Cote d’Ivoire to recommend they approve the acquisition, voicing their support for Roxgold’a contribution towards socio-economic development in Burkina Faso.  
>  
>On a political front, both Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire recently had elections in late 2020, with both incumbent retaining their seats. This means we have another 4 years in both countries until the next election cycle. Naturally, elections in Africa and West Africa always carry some headline risk, so getting these events behind us should alleviate some concerns from investors. However, not to keep hitting this point, but even political turmoil in West Africa has had little effect on mining in these countries. Look at Mali, which had a coup in August, and not one mining company has been affected, as Mali knows it is in the country’s best interest to keep the gold mines running.  
>  
>On a monetary policy front, these countries use the West Africa CFA Franc, which is pegged to the Euro, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (an agreement among countries in West Africa) have aligned their fiscal and monetary policies and have an agreement to promote regional economic integration.  
>  
>Finally, the reason you want to look at West African miners once you accept the jurisdictional risk, is that the Birimian Gold Belt has been the most prolific region in the world for gold discoveries in the last 15 years. There has been the discovery of over 75 million ounces of gold in the past 15 years, with almost 50% located in Burkina Faso – and Cote d’Ivoire is considered to be underexplored historically which is why there has been a rush of investment there. We are in the right jurisdiction, and have the cash flow producing power to drive growth organically without needing to dilute shareholders. As Séguéla moves forward, and investors start to recognize the impact this will have on our cash flows, we are confident our share price will step in line with our earnings growth. Meanwhile, we continue to drill away at Boussoura, which is in the heart of the Birimian Belt and has been returning intriguing results that have us now believing we have a 3rd project to put in our pipeline of development.  
>  
>Roxgold continues to trade at a discount to our peers, as the average investor still sees us as a single asset producer with the one mine in Burkina Faso. In the next 18 months, we will be multi-asset producer out of Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire with an exceptional exploration portfolio in the right jurisdiction to move projects ahead quickly.  
>  
>Hope that was not too lengthy.  
>  
>Regards,

&#x200B;

**EDIT: TLDR:** According to the investor relations team, African mining projects are safer than South American, the political climate is stable (in their area) and has been for a few decades. The regions that ROXG mines and explores currently do not want to hinder the mining industry as it is a huge economy driver in their countries.",2021-02-13 02:32:36

This is just my personal take but the people telling everyone to sell, and calling people bag holders, don’t realize that you don’t risk what you can’t lose. The people here putting hundreds of thousands in, have the ability to lose this cash and be okay. It’s fun, it’s risky, but sometimes extremely rewarding. 

No one was ever asking you to put in your life savings into the hands of WSB. I can understand why some people are mad. We all see the same hot posts, what you take away from a DD post is YOUR responsibility. No actual WSB member lied to you or tricked you, just told you what they think is gonna work. The fact is though, there are 100% shady tactics going on behind the scenes between the billionaire hedge funds. Anyone who thinks that the rich people aren’t doing everything they can to make sure we do not put them in a position like a couple weeks ago again; are ridiculous. 

The people on this subreddit are the same as you and me, random people coming together to try and make money. I have no clue how to invest or what a good stock is, that’s why we are here. The ability to influence the market , however small, is possible with our community. We saw what happened when reddit focused on GME, but we didn’t expect the repercussions from the hedge funds. 

However, the main point is this. We are not here risking the money we need to pay rent, would you bet your life savings on the super bowl? If you find good DD and believe in a stock, put your money in and be PATIENT.

Some Small US Semiconductor Stocks You May Not Know About,29,lieaf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lieaf6/some_small_us_semiconductor_stocks_you_may_not/,28,1613175332.0,"I know you all seem to be mostly into video games, weed, and rainbow colored keyboards, but businesses make many more things than that. One thing they make and is in insanely high demand right now are semiconductors, little things that act as both conductors and insulators and make all your electronics do electronic things.

Trust me, they are very important.

Some of you have no doubt seen $AMD, $NVDA, and $MU on here before. I am sure you have heard of Texas Instruments, since they made the calculators you played Pac-Man and Drug Lord on in high school.

Anyway, for people like me who have many people depending on them for food and shelter and lack the testicular fortitude or smooth brain cells to throw thousands of dollars at one company, here are some more affordable companies based in the US and poised to grow in the coming months/years as demand skyrockets and supply lags behind.

**MaxLinear $MXL**: These guys just keep growing and beating all of their earnings and revenue targets, net revenue up 24% in Q4 of 2020, and have beaten earnings in 6 straight quarters. Their RoE routinely beats the competition, and their projected sales growth is good.

**Chip_MOS $I_MO_S**: (Sorry for the formatting, this guy is just under 1B cap, but did not want to leave it out) Just another small company with good financials and ever increasing sales/revenues, the latter up 24% in January. They have consistently good P/E and P/S ratios, and even offer a pretty generous dividend if you are into that kind of thing.

**Advanced Energy Industries $AEIS**: If you like consistent gainers, this is for you. They basically never fail to meet earnings expectations, and essentially always outperforms competitors in RoE and cash flow.

**ON Semiconductor Corp $ON**: Another consistent gainer that I almost never see in the red regardless of the rest of the market. Revenues that just keep improving, they keep making good acquisitions, some analysts are suggesting 20% or higher gains from these guys in 21-22. Reported earnings per share of 35 cents, just another great surprise form $ON. Options for this company are cheap right now as well, but rising fast. Institutional investors are flocking to this one too, so if you want to follow the smart money, $ON is a good bet.

There are a few more, but I can not mention them due to relatively low market caps. If you do not have much to invest, but want to get in on this sector, check out Magna Chip ($ M X) too.

All these companies have great growth potential and financials, have consistently gained, have excellent analyst scores, and are in a huge growth sector with massive demand and a supply that is so low governments worldwide are seriously looking into how to improve it.

The Biden administration is working on executive orders and funding/tax credits to help these companies pump out more and more product.

Think about some of the big growth industries right now. Well, they all depend on semiconductors. EVERYTHING has a computer in it, and they all need semiconductors, from your car, to your PlayStation, or the lighting/irrigation systems used to grow all that Canadian weed.

These are just my opinions, look into it yourselves before you spend any money. But these are not hyped stocks, so do not expect them to pump or dump, or make you a millionaire overnight. But they sure are green a lot.",2021-02-13 02:15:32

Intriguing Tesla volatility play I stumbled across .... March 2021 $20p,2,lij98f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lij98f/intriguing_tesla_volatility_play_i_stumbled/,1,1613188580.0,"https://mobile.twitter.com/alexharfouche1/status/1359902501756166146

I had to read that thread a couple of times. Forget being a gay bear on TSLA. No one buying $20p expects it to go ITM

However, when GME was pumping, I bought some March $30p for $1 and when GME pumped to $480, I sold them for $1.60

HOW CAN SHE SLAP!?! Because the IV on the option chain shot up to 1000%

I did some digging around and some big money boy bought a metric fuck ton of Feb & Mar $20p, check out the OI

So how do I make money off this shit?! TSLA currenttly has an IV of ~70% 

Last month it was at ~85%

Dec IV was ~110%

If the volatility in TSLA picks up back to the 85% range, ToS is telling me these $20p should go from $.04 to around $.12

Say what you will, that is 200% increase

If IV goes back to 100% range and Tsla drops to around $750 sharply (like in one session) then these can be worth around $.50

Will I be able to sell them if they pump that high? Who the fuck knows. Someone bought 500k of these, so why not throw some cash at it

DD on the Commodity SuperCycle and How To Get The Most 🚀🚀 Tendies With Oil Company Penny Options KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) & EPD (Enterprise Products Partners),10,liiwrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiwrx/dd_on_the_commodity_supercycle_and_how_to_get_the/,3,1613187591.0,"Hi fellow autists,

Your wife's boyfriends' (multiple I know you know) favorite contemporary art dealer is back with another DD on the commodity super cycle and the most 🚀🚀🚀🚀may be in sight with oil company penny options in KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners).

What is a commodity super cycle? 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/j-p-morgan-sees-commodity-supercycle-already-kicking-off](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/j-p-morgan-sees-commodity-supercycle-already-kicking-off?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google)

It's the rise of many physical commodity prices (such as those of food, oil, metals, chemicals, fuels, and the like) driven by various factors, but this COVID one is mostly by the stimulus spending and a weaker US dollar and the parabolic growth being observed in the East led by China where we see demand above 2020 levels. 

This new ""roaring 20s"" will be accompanied by easy monetary and fiscal policy (more 🚀🚀🚀🚀), a weak US dollar, and stronger inflation, all supportive for commodity prices. (Yes, I repeated what I said because it is important)

And why Oil? Besides the obvious reason of Saudi did an output cut and raised prices on the crude. I personally think another reason is because we have put so much emphasis on renewable energy like Solar and Hydrogen, but we ignored the basic scientific fact that in order for a total energy replacement and revolution to happen, it will take at least another 20-50 years! So oil will still be around and coexist alongside the solar the hydrogen and all kind of other good stuff fancy energy! 

[https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/energy-2050-insights-from-the-ground-up](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/energy-2050-insights-from-the-ground-up)

And oil companies have seen some rebound, but they are far from the pre COVID level, and if the commodity super cycle is happening (it is already happening, go check the oil companies tickers today) as explained by everyone's favorite market guru Marko Kolanovic from JPM, then I personally think we will very likely see oil companies going parabolic across the board as the major funds that have made huge profits from tech and renewable energy to cycle some of the profit into the oil which needed some tendie love and most importantly it is undervalued.

Out of all oil companies, I personally think KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will benefit most fabulously from this energy cycle. Why? Because besides the fact that both KMI and EPD are oil industry first-team relatively large market cap players, their option prices are very reasonable for a good trade if the super cycle takes off with a rocket engine. 

Let's let the data speak:

KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) is trading at $14.77, market cap $33.43B. KMI pre COVID crash high price was $22.16 on 02/19/2020. KMI $20 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $0.03! 

EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) is trading at $21.76, market cap $47.50B. EPD pre COVID crash high price was $26.22 on 02/20/2020. EPD $26 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $0.06! 

Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products are what I find as large enough market cap, so they will not be too easy to dilute shares, and their OTM options for 03/19/21 and later dates are priced very, very well.

For me, these are the type of options trades to get 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 tendies, and this super cycle will have large funds coming in hoards and get on this oil sector rocket!

TLDR: Commodity SuperCycle is happening. Penny options from oil companies such as KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will take off.

I’m in the field neuroscience and pharmaceutical industry(I’m a slave uni intern:( ). Listen up guys you’re probably wondering hmmm why should I keep and eye out in these stocks. Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics, anti depressants ssris, mood suppressors, maois, anti anxiety medication, benzos, addiction medication, and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies, and then bought into the big pharma borg. 

The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didn’t return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success. 

The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit 6.8 billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom.

It started with GameStop and WSB. As soon as they(Hedge Funds and Wall Street ppl) started looking into this subreddit the stock just plummets. 

Around the same time AMC and BB where on a rally and people on WSB were catching on and big Hedge Funds and Wall Street people also took notice and those also significantly fell. 

Certain weed stocks started rallying so hard and once again Reddit was on it. The day after all the weed stonks talk on WSB brought a huge dip for them. 

Now obviously something is going on here. I like numbers and started looking at them but nothing was adding up. Why were these things happening? BUT I figured it out. At first I started to think the answers wasn’t in the numbers but it is !!!! Just think about! Why would all big HFs and Wall Street people do this?

The perfect trading plan,83,livi2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/livi2d/the_perfect_trading_plan/,34,1613228522.0,"So here is my new expert trading strategy.
1. Pick whatever stock you retards are currently pumping
2. Yolo 90% of everything you have into shares
3. Spend rest of money on far otm puts (but not to far out) that expire in 2 weeks.
4. Profit when stock crashes right after you buy, and prophet if stock miraculously keeps pumping. 
5. If stocks still pumping, sell amount equivalent to your profit and roll money back into more puts
6. Continue until stock finally divebombs and you make a cool 1000% return, or you run out of shares to sell and wait for either expiration or the stock tanks. 
7. Sell all options on Friday so they dont fucking expire into nothing.

 it works best with min of 100 shares owned and 10 otm puts that will gain at least 100$ per point. 

Pros: takes advantage of bag holding paper handed losers and stock hype, but still gets you great returns if the stock moons.

Cons: you lose the options premium if the stock trades flat for a week.
You need alot of liquidity to make it work with any stock over 50$
Doesn't work on anything with absurd IV

Throw your opinions at me if you want but I dont GAF because y'all know more about the flavor of your own earwax then you do the stockmarket.

This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. ""paper hands"" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right.

There are many publically traded companies in the market that have huge potential.

CERENCE: A REAL DD YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS!,26,litts0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/litts0/cerence_a_real_dd_you_do_not_want_to_miss/,28,1613221785.0,"**Cerence (CRNC):** A real DD (WARNING NOT A MEME STOCK)  
  
**Company profile:**  
  
Cerence builds **AI powered virtual assistants** for the mobility/transportation market   including but not limited to two-wheel vehicles, planes, tractors, cruise ships and elevators.  
  
Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We are a **premier provider** of AI- powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles, including one of the world’s most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants, such as “Hey BMW” and “Ni hao Banma”. 
  
**Market Capitalization:**  
  
Cerence has a market cap of just **$5 billion**. As a play on two of the hottest growth segments (EV and AI), Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth.   
  
**Customer Profile:**  
  
**CERENCE products are in 53% OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020. This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date.**   
    
Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including BMW, Daimler, FCA Group, Ford, Geely, GM, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN and Harman. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.   
    
**Competitive Strengths: ** (directly from 10K)  
  
**Industry-leading speech-related technology**  
    
**Hybrid edge-cloud system architecture** Our software platform’s hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity.   
  
**Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning** Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models.   
  
**Broad language coverage** Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the U.S. and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.   
  
**Broad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers** We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands.   
  
**Competitors:** A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape. 
  
**Large technology companies** Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience.   
   
**Small, focused competitors** We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the U.S., iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.   
  
**Competitors (My analysis):**  
   
I appreciate that Cerence's auditors make sure they address all potential risks. However, I do not see big tech as a threat. I see them as a ""gain-guarantee."" Cerence's AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence’s small peers. The biggest risk I see here is that a company--ahem like AAPL or Google--might purchase Cerence. Cerence's market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future.    
  
**Revenues:**   
  
Revenues are up to $326 Million for fiscal year 2020. **$95 Million in Q1 2021** literally on pace for 25% revenue growth. [Here’s a chart with Revenue growth for the last three years]( https://imgur.com/a/eNKnHnR)    
  
**Gross Margin:**   

72% gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter. Huge margins which is extremely attractive.  

**Research and Development:**  
   
The best expense on the income statement in my opinion. Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R&D costs. This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage.   
  
“We believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.”  

**Balance Sheet:**  
  
$1,700,000,000 assets to $700,000,000 liabilities. For my finance guys, a 1.37 current ratio. $266 bil in LTD.      
    
Goodwill is a concentrated risk that makes up most of their assets (over $1 billion). Definitely not the best.   

**Cash flows:**  
  
Cash flow from op positive.   
   
**Why this is the best play out on the market right now:**. 
  
*Growing company in a niche industry with massive upside potential   
*Market leader   
*Strong Financials  
*Net Income Positive  
*Undervalued as fuck  
  
**TLDR: AI Company that does voice recognition in 53% of all new vehicles, revenues are up 25% YoY, small market capitalization, primed for massive growth.**   
   
**My price target: $250 EOY (Disclosure: went super long at $49 and this is not financial advice)** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Remember- GEE EM EE is only where it is because of blatant market manipulation.,8637,liqvpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liqvpq/remember_gee_em_ee_is_only_where_it_is_because_of/,1011,1613211160.0,"The only reason GME is where it is right now is through blatant market manipulation. 

On January 28th GME was over $500 pre market. It had sensational momentum. Buying GME on the 27th at $300+ was not a bad play. GME had already gravity slingshotted round Earth and had blown past the moon, on course to leave the fucking Milky Way. The shorts were completely fucking fucked. They were done. Dead. Bags heavier than a dying star. About to be squeezed so hard they’d turn into hand shaped diamonds. And then suddenly they weren’t. 

It wasn’t fucking short laddering that saved them. It wasn’t fucking “hedge fund tactics.” It wasn’t synthetic longs. It wasn’t a bear raid (look it up, this is what they are actually doing ). It wasn’t cause gme was a silly meme play. none of this is what stopped the inter dimensional GME rocket. 
 
What saved them? Market manipulation. “They” (dtc/ brokers / clearing houses whoever) changed the rules and essentially banned buying the stock.  They locked the (retail at least) market out of one side of a trade. The fuck?

They didn’t halt the stock. 


They didn’t suspend it. 


The stock wasn’t halted by the exchanges. No That would stop all trading. 


They just stopped people *buying*. Kill the demand and surprise! supply overtakes demand  and price drops like your wife’s pants when her bf is in town. 

But why?

If they hadn’t restricted buying? Well the shorts would be bankrupt. But they can’t let retail win. Specially fucking Reddit. Retail investors are idiots remember. Institutions are far smarter than that bunch. 

The big boys can’t have retail win. That’s preposterous. So just stop em buying. You do that to *any stock* and it would absolutely tank. Its mind blowing how blatant it was. 

And this was all to get themselves out a terrible situation they engineered through sheer unadulterated greed. So greedy that dumbfuck retail caught them with their dick in the cookie jar. So bad that  the clearing houses / dtc didn’t want to pay for the gargantuan bags that were being held by the shorts. Because they’d have to. Someone had to pay and the shorts were, well, poetically the shorts were going to be short... A few billion dollars. 

So it turns out all you have to do to avoid being molested by the squeeze of the century is change the rules, very clearly manipulate the stocks price, and suddenly squeezeageddon is a little gentle hug.

If this doesn’t show just how rigged the markets are, I don’t know what else could. Maybe a news story coming out that the DTC and large firms have a daily morning zoom call to literally decide what every single stocks opening and closing price will be every day, and then phone Cramer so he can say the opposite on CNBC. 

Everything else since the great buying lockdown is small fry fuckery. Remember this.

But here’s the other thing. You think the boys at the funds hoarding short positions like they’re some kind of short dragon of Wall Street  are going just go “well that was close, let’s close all our GME shorts now while we can?” No fucking way. I guaranfuckingtee they’re doubling down. They think GME is worth $0. They aren’t to stop until they’re right. Specially when they’re playing against “dumbfuck” retail and the investor known as Reddit. 

GME ain’t done yet.

Tesla is the primordial ooze that binds us retards together on the eternal path to tendie town.

To reinvigorate some WSB spirit, I've decided to do what I did last time after [taking a major loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhq2pa/cloudflare_earnings_overnight_play_good_ol/), YOLO the rest of my life savings into TSLA calls and make it all back. By the end of next week I'll be fine dining only the most prestigious tendies on a private jet or my kids will be eating cat food I paid for with a second mortgage on my house. There is no in-between, this is the way. Now for the three-for-one:

# Due Diligence

Tesla literally can not go down next week. It is physically impossible to stray below it's current price point. The timeless syllogism of Tesla is known as modus ponens

Proposition 1: Stonks only go up

Proposition 2: Tsla is a stonk

Conclusion: Tsla only goes up, QED.

I know I've said it before but this literally cannot go tits up. It's like getting in at Gourds before they were a big hit. It's like that one dude who bought a lot of tranches or whatever the fuck before we knew about tranches. It's foolproof. ***Huge upside potential with very little downside. Does that ring a bell?”***

# Bet

If Tesla closes Friday above $900 I will be getting a Tesla tattoo on my ass cheek.

If Tesla closes Friday above $1000, that tattoo will be the size of a small watermelon.

Don't you dare even insult me by even asking if I'm going to follow through, I am. I'm not like these pussies who fake their bets harder than their wives fake their orgasms. You bet your sweet ass I will follow through.

# Yolo

Edit: Cathie Wood has a ton of this in ARK ETFs already

I’m a Realtor in one of the test markets for Opendoor (Charlotte) and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far.  They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry.

A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence: I have been a licensee since early 2013. My husband is real estate closing attorney . His office handles 300+ real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18-20 full-time employees.

My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney. Back in 2010 – 2015, his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense. He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system, helping them apply for and obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender. Back then, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses. They simply couldn’t sell them and move on. They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house. The fed bailed out the banks  by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out, but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long, complicated and very difficult. As a Realtor, I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales. During the markets in 2008-2014, this was a huge majority of houses.  Around 2015, the scales tipped back and the market, for the most part, was nearly recovered. Currently, there are no short sales. VERY rare, if so.

Currently, the market in Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand. I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table. It is common for most houses to get 20+ offers within hours of listing. It’s an absolute bloodbath out there.

To say that I understand this industry is an understatement. I know it in and out, up and down, left and right. I eat, sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time.

iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased. I am seeing it happen here now, in real time. So, let me explain…

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet  has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads. It’s ironic, but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

You take a lot of Xanax in this industry….

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings. Seller doesn’t have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations. Seller doesn’t have to hear about the buyer’s demands. Seller doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama. Seller doesn’t have to deal with Realtors. Seller doesn’t have to pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%). Seller is in control. Seller has total power of the transaction. Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.

Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule. No working around some Realtor’s schedule. The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “ If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “ Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

Now is the time where I recommend you move over to Opendoor.com and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly. You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate. Yes, even for the retards on this sub.

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market.  As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings (NOT my husband) scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG! wE aRe In A bUbBlE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Asaets. This simply can't happen anymore are at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

Sidenote: I bought a foreclosure and the prior owner took out 3 cash out refis in 2007 within the same week. He didn't tell the lenders about one another at all. There was NO underwriting process that would have caught this at the time. The guy took all the cash and used it to buy a horse ranch in the same city. He never made a payment to any of the 3 lenders and knew it would go to foreclosure. He didn't care because he won. He beat the system, and you know what? He got away with it. Because he was one of thousands just like him who did the exact same thing and the banks realized it would be cheaper to eat it than fight it through the court systems and try to collect against most people who had no assets. This was 2008. 
This will never be possible again.

**wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs????**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA, bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr.**

No, owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars.

**Cars are a depreciating asset.**

**Real estate is an appreciating asset.**

95% of millionaires are made with owning real estate, myself included.

Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods. Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank.

Of course there are exceptions to everything. People are able to sell their house after owning it for 30 years and make retirement level money. People retire off their equity. You can't sell your daily driver after using it for 10 years and make the equivalent rate of return. Appreciating vs depreciating. Of course exceptions exist like Condos in RE and rare classic cars. But for the most part, in 99% situations, real estate gains value while personal property loses it. This is economics 101.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

My Response:

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs:**

No, it’s not. Uber has zero assets. They don’t own a single car.

They have nothing but their systems and software.

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash, Airbnb, etc.

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.


Okay, I think I’m going to wrap this up. I’m sure Ill think of more stuff and will add to it later but I have to get some work done.

[$SE] Multi-year Emerging Market Growth - This is the Way,52,lidxl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lidxl3/se_multiyear_emerging_market_growth_this_is_the/,58,1613174345.0,"Alright, listen up my fellow autists. I was drafting this DD up to put in my private archives, but this place isn't autistic enough anymore. Apes are too alpha with their diamond hands and I'm here to bring you some plays to put tendies on the table like good ol days.

I'm here to talk about what's for some reason an under followed stock. **[$SE](https://i.imgur.com/dkHcLZk.png)** 


**BUT WHAT IS $SE?!?!?!?**
Sea Limited is a leading E-commerce, digital payments, and mobile gaming company based in Southeast Asia NOT COMMIE TOWN CHINA (disclaimer I'm long $BABA). They operate through those three segments and benefit from synergies between them.

Let's start with **E-commerce**
It's the middle of a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I bet your house is filled with cardboard boxes up to the ceilings. At least mine is. I'm buying a lot of shit online, because I'm working from home, trading in my PJs and making FAT STACKS off $SE. While I don't live in Malaysia, I use Amazon. It's the future. Look at the entire brick and mortar retail industry over the last 5-10 years *cough* GME *cough*. Things aren't so hot. You can get things cheaper and exactly what you want.

*I feel this part of the thesis is pretty self explanatory. Do you believe people will continue to buy things online over the next 10 years?* 

* Yes -> buy $SE 
* No -> Go buy GME lol

But how are they doing? FUCKING GREAT. I have access to some proprietary app data I'm too lazy to smuggle off my work PC, but let me say. Things are UP. Downloads, DAU, session length, all the metrics. BOOMIN. Don't believe me? Here's how they've been doing vs. local competitors ($BABA owned Lazada) and a private company rumored to be involved with a one of those special purpose tickers (Tokopedia).

**$SE** mainly competes in its e-commerce segment in the Southeast Asia market. It's key countries are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. 
As shown here using google trends, we see that Shopee is now claiming the top spot in relative search interest in many of these markets.

[Current Growth Rates](https://i.imgur.com/3m1OtVS.png)

**Digital Payments.** $SE also has a digital wallet app. This is Southeast Asia. They don't have JP Morgan pulling from everyone's pockets. Everyone's got a phone and uses this in tandem to purchase things online. Did I mention that $SE has both B2C and C2C shopping apps? Want to transact with local business? Process payments and handle your small business checking through $SE. Makes it easy to track and receive payments from customers. Fucking great. Basically lets the company pull a sliver from every transaction going on in their markets.

[Not a compelling YOLO worthy investment on it's own but bolsters the package, just like how stuffing a sock bolsters my cock.](https://i.imgur.com/ogvlJ17.png)



**Mobile Gaming.** What's that? Boom Beach is for dads? I know. Doesn't matter, the rest of the world loves this shit. Their mobile gaming division is called Garena and their biggest game is a battle royale called Free Fire:

 >Garena is a leading esports organizer. It hosts esports events around the world that range from grassroots local tournaments to some of the most viewed professional esports competitions globally. Garena’s largest global esports tournament of 2019, the Free Fire World Series, achieved over 130 million cumulative online views.

[Somehow, this shit fills stadiums.](https://i.imgur.com/QLDDvbz.png)

[And growth don't stop.](https://i.imgur.com/m6BjdsO.png)


Why it's interesting? Recent IPO (relatively). This thing is less than 2 years public and absolutely on a tear. Market cap of $140 billion is especially compelling. Consider that the [e-commerce growth is the fastest in the world in their markets.](https://i.imgur.com/wgSi5qQ.png).

It's a company you value on the top-line. So in a region with 8-10% GDP growth, and 10%+ ecommerce growth it's easy to make a case for 20% top-line growth on right there. Now lets consider an increasing shift in spend from brick and mortar to digital of 10% (you make 1 out of 10 purchases online more than you did last year) and gaining market share. 50% growth isn't hard to achieve on this piece of the business alone. And that's ANNUAL. 

How to play it? LEAPS. Shares are for apes and frees up cash for FDs on pull backs (if it drops more than 10% hammer the ask on all the 20% OTM 60 DTE you can get).



**TL;DR? EDUCATE YOURSELF AND READ IT. THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME.**

Weed!,348,lidfua,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lidfua/weed/,181,1613172913.0,"Smoke week and read this about GME

Crossposting. This keeps getting removed. Think why 

Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212

​

ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares

​

Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!

​

Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!

​

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??

​

TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%

​

​

Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be £Greedy ::

If you see mistakes please correct me....

​

Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will ""only pay"" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

I'm guessing no because the gay mods deleted my post, here's a screenshot :

the KRE Rally is not over and here is why :

Regional banks, more so than the big money centers in XLF make their $ by taking loans from the FED or depositors who block their money for a year or two and lend it for longer maturities. The best proxy for this metric is the 10/2 spread and it has been going to the moon !

Regional banks are the entities that are most exposed to ""small business"" in the market, in fact if you want to go long the ""real economy"", KRE is about your only bet along with some office/mall REITS/B2B stocks and the true winner, which hasn't been frontran yet of the upcoming reopening is the real economy. 

Have you heard that papi biden is working on **another stimulus package focused on infrastructure ?** Who loans the money to the small bizes who work on that shit ? you guessed it, KRE. I think most of the market has a hard time understanding the size and potential impact of what the dems are cooking for us, here's an excerpt from top strategist at MS leila : 

 ***Unprecedented stimulus***  *– The magnitude of monetary + fiscal stimulus in the US is almost hard for the brain to fully appreciate. We’re not economists, but it appears as if we are on track for \~9 Trillion between fiscal + monetary in the US, over 3x what we did during the financial crisis.  On the fiscal side, if Biden gets his $1.9 Trillion on the back of Trump’s $2.2 Trillion + $900 Billion plans, total Fiscal stimulus over the past year will be \~$5 Trillion or \~24% of U.S. GDP.  The 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus amounted to \~ $1 Trillion -- so we're doing 5x the fiscal.  On the Monetary side, the Fed Balance sheet has risen by $3.6 Trillion since 2019. In 2008-2010 it rose $1.4 Trillion, so we're doing 2.6x the Monetary.   These monetary and fiscal efforts in the US equate to over 40% of GDP.* 

**But isn't the fed keeping interest rates super low ?** 

**Yes they are but this is the limit,** during the last minutes of the FOMC the topic was du jour was removing the special QE programme. Essentially, given that the **worst is behind us in the real economy, the FED WILL NOT BE MARGINALLY MORE DOVISH AND THE NEXT STEP IS A RATE HIKE CYCLE.** it might start in 22 or 23 but no later. Of course it will be priced in both rates and Bank stocks way ahead of time. in fact you can see that bonds have been selling off lately as the market digests the news around the infrastructure package and the FED speeches always make the bonds bounce but then it gets sold again :).

I’ve noticed the FUD campaign has been shifting lately, It’s shifted towards calling al you retards actually retarded for buying GME at it’s height. While yeah, buying high and selling low is actually retarded, I am not disputing that. 

But what I’ve noticed is that no one seems to be mentioning the fact that Robinhood (and by extension the DTC)  LITERALLY HIT THE ‘OFF’ SWITCH ON BUYS. That’s fucking right it was a great play before 28/1 even at 300 or 400. (If you bought at 300 after 28/1 you may actually be retarded)

The FUD campaign (or general memory loss from all the weed stonks) has made most of you forget that WE WERE FUCKING ROBBED.

I'll get to the once again part in a few.

I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 & 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.

First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their [Website](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx)


Revenue: 0

PE: Divide by zero error


Profit Margin: Zilch

Operating Cash Flow: -11.53 million.


Net loss per share 2019: 0.45, Net Loss per share 2020: 0.76. They are burning more money faster.



**Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the ""new battery"" isn't patented or at least mentioned here**


R & D burned 8.13 million in 2020, and Admin burned 3.7 million.



Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020




Their R&D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.

They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.

**In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?**

Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.

The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all. **So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.**

**[Other notes: The new battery system isn't patented or proprietary, and is not listed in their patents.  Which are pretty lackluster.](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/hyliion-inc)**


[I\[f you read between the lines, the press release was stating they have a new battery cooling system. That's it.](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2021/Hyliion-Introduces-Next-Generation-Battery-Module-to-Improve-Performance-and-Efficiency/default.aspx)

And how it became a thing on reddit once again: Almost a year ago when it launched, it hit $59/share, then dropped to $13 where it stayed.  It's already made bagholders on reddit with BS vaporware.  Don't let it do it again.


TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 💩


Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.

**Main Takeaways: Their patent portfolio is trash, the miracle battery isn't patented, they say their IP is only worth 346k, and they dump more money on admin then they do R&D**

This is no shit post, but I think we have a small Australian biotech about to go around the twist.

$MESO trades on the NASDAQ and ASX. It's a Melbourne biotech that has had a whole bunch of recent catalysts. They specifically focus on stem cell therapies to treat a range of diseases. Now if you believe in stem cell therapies long term, I think $MESO could be a good buy;  


* aGVHD: Mesoblast's Remstemcel to treat this horrible disease received a 9-1 ODAC vote but the FDA still gave Mesoblast a CRL meaning the drug wouldn't receive a BLA. They are in ongoing discussions with the FDA as this is an unmet need where no other treatment options exist with high mortality. I think this will eventually get conditional approval.
* CHF: Chronic heart failure is one of the biggest killers in the world. Their recent phase 3 trial here reduced MACE events by 60% in a statistically significant random controlled experiment. Many physicians have said this will change the paradigm of how we treat heart failure. Expect $MESO to partner with big pharma on this one. It's worth lots of tendies. It didn't meet the primary endpoint which was reduction in hospitalisations, but absolutely crushed the secondary endpoints which are more meaningful anyway.
* COVID19 ARDS: This was using remestemcel to reduce inflammation for COVID patients. Eventually they stopped enrolling as they didn't think it would reach statistical significance, mostly because the course and treatment paradigm throughout the pandemic has changed. ie, ventilator is now a last resort etc... However, these results are being unblinded and they've done a major partnership with Novartis on this one for all cause ARDS.

If you think stem cell therapies have a place as standard of care in the future then I think $MESO is a good one to throw some dumb money at considering they've completed quite a few P3 trials and it shows their product clearly works. They just need partners, getting their trials designed a bit better now that they understand more about mechanisms of action, subsets of patients and when to target them with treatment.

Welcome my retards and Yolo artists,

As many of you know, blizzcon 2021 is coming and here a few prediction from my side:

Wow, the biggest IP of Activision Blizzard will get a new major content patch in April-June, making people re subscribe to experience the content.

Diablo 4 will get a release date with pre ordering enabled surging in sweet millions. 

Overwatch 2 will be released this year so more millions for them. 

Hearthstone will get a new battle pass in the next few months so again a few bucks more. 


Q: Activision Blizzard has a 80B market cap, will D4 even rise it high? 
A: probably yes. If we look at the Release of shadow lands and many people returning to wow buying a monthly subscription and the expansion for ~60$ has increased the price of the stock from 80$ to something above 90$ now blizzcon pre-orders had pushed it to 100$/share. Diablo 4 might at least push the worth of the stock by 10$ because I assume 90% of the wow fanbase are also Diablo fans. 

All in all I think investing in Activision-Blizzard is a no brainer at the given time. Since the release of classic Wow servers and shadowlands they have been slowly but steady regaining worth and if they won't fuck up during an esports event a la Blitzchung, it is pretty safe to assume the stonks will go up to at least 120$/stonk.

AMD and Intel DD,125,liyay9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liyay9/amd_and_intel_dd/,144,1613241674.0,"With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

Advice: if you want to play this, buy calls that are at least 2 to 3 months out, or buy shares.

UWMC: a powder keg with over 100% of float shorted,88,lix2ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lix2ut/uwmc_a_powder_keg_with_over_100_of_float_shorted/,107,1613235708.0,"listen up retards i'm gonna make this brief so you can go back to clipping the toe nails of your wife's boyfriend

all you autists looking ""for the next GME"". well guess what, there is no next GME. that milk's spilt, sour and cold. but there's a company out there so boring, so \*\*\*\*ing uninteresting, that just like GME is has strong value characteristics, and has over 100% short float, and it's hiding in plain sight.

**UWMC**: stands for United Whole Mortgage C\*nts. they do things with mortgages. right now, the market doesn't really like things to do with mortgages, because its a cyclical business nearing its peak. it's pumping out great returns (maybe at this peak) and valued at only 5.5x P/E. the market don't care. Last earnings, the company reported EBITDA of $1.4B FOR THE QUARTER (whole market cap of only $15B). It also has a big boomer 4.5% dividend. This sh\*t is unloved just like your dross GME was, and like GME is actually a fly guy of a bizniz

**The set-up**: this was a former SPAC. I know, I know. Some of you apes held this when it was a SPAC, and now your diapers are in a twist because it didn't moon. Well, f\*\*\* off I don't care. You're not the only ones: HFs are short this guy like you wouldn't believe. THE FLOAT IS ONLY 6% OF THE ENTIRE MARKET CAP, and half of it is like by one institution that's in it for the long-term (Magnetar). That means the effective float is only 3%! Right now it's being manipulated like you wouldn't believe. This thing is a powder keg and it can explode in the shorts' face.

**The mooning**: There are huge numbers of calls at $15 and $17.5. If this thing gets anywhere close to them in a short period of time, the gamma squeeze could propel this thing to $50-60 in a week. If it doesn't. If it doesn't, you're holding an actual good clucking company at 5.5x PE, so you're brains wont be over your windshield like you late weed apes. Fundamentally it's probably worth $20-25, so you have an actual fundamental value play here too just as a back-up

**The play**: buy shares first! This thing has a squoze in it. Also buy 2/19 and 3/19 calls at $10-17.5

**DD link for short report**: [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC)

**TLDR**: everyone hated GME. now every hates UWMC. UWMC is boring and doesn't get you high so you apes have missed it, but it has effective 100% short interest for tiny float (3%) of company, strong fundamentals and a squeeze that hasn't squoze, company worth double anyway but could easily run up 10x if the shorts get nuk'd

**Me**: in for 4,000 shares at $9.18. this is not financial advice. do your own diligence you cucks.

AMD has been in a recent downtrend since the start of january. However, the price action is starting to consolidate around 92 with a small run thats gonna run out of steam soon. 

The MACD just crossed at the -0.2 so the reversal may be weak. The Stoch also is more than halfway to oversold territory. Once it runs out of steam it may have its current 93 price as a support, if not the next support is at 89 ish

This means a little sideways action with the 95 resistance before retesting ATH. Now, i could be wrong, but i do not foresee any catalysts in the next weeks (feel free to chime in). 

Could breach ATH by next quarter. Wed have to see the price action then.

Analysis of the DJ average growth and the sub prime mortgage crisis of 2008 and how the current market isn't overvalued.🖕🌈🐻,34,liwhdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liwhdb/analysis_of_the_dj_average_growth_and_the_sub/,36,1613232776.0,"    So I had a theory I wanted to test out after listening to Cathie Woods recent interview and how she didn't feel like the market was overvalued. I dont want to watch it again to recap her reasons I forget but I liked it when I heard it. Every one on CNBC or basically any other market analysis is all 🌈🐻 doom and gloom because FEAR SELLS! Seriously ever buy tickets to a scary movie? Some people actually want to hear that shit so thats what they put out.

   That got me to thinking, what would the market look like today if greedy bankers hadn't given 5 interest only mortgages to every stripper in Vegas? Time to read charts and do mathmagic (yeah I'm actually on the spectrum and that gets my dick hard).

   According to this Zack's article: [here](https://finance.zacks.com/average-return-dow-jones-during-its-lifetime-3314.html)

   In the 91 years prior to 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew at an average rate of 4.3%. Overall rate over its 122 years in 5.42%, in a 25 year sample from 1987-2012 the DJ grew by 7.55%. What the fuck? Why almost double since 1987? In my personal opinion the early adoption of the personal computer by Wallstreet and the emergence of fast growth tech companies that the semiconductor gave birth to. In summary I've elected to use 7.55% for my calculations because we don't use the Pony Express or Wells Fargo to deliver stock certificates anymore(Buffett might still use WF lol).

   I'm going 20 years back here for a proper trend line, and it will segue into another related analysis for the second half. Starting in Y2K, thats the year 2000 for you Gen Zs, the DJIA was 10,729.38. Now let's use that 7.55% average year over growth and forecast the Dow today vs one with no housing collapse. 

DJ Current: 31,458.40

DJ No 2008: 49,746.08

   The fallout from the events in 2008 set the market trend line behind by 6 and a half years on the 7.55% model. My actual analysis of the 20 year sample I used finds a 6.54%, but that includes a -33.84% drop for '08. If you remove that event the growth rockets to 8.54%. So I feel like the 7.55% model is perfectly reasonable.

   In summation analysts(🌈🐻) have been screeching for the last half decade about how we are do for a market correction, and I agree! The market is attempting to correct losing a third of its value that took a century to build in one year!

$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,448,livgzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/livgzy/tsla_is_positioned_for_a_massive_reversal/,522,1613228416.0,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

***Article (trimmed):***

Sun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp. at the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is predicting a paradigm shift in investing as younger people swarm into financial assets.

Sun said he’s prepared to hold onto his GameStop shares that he purchased near the highs late last month 💎🖐 in an effort to tap into the adrenaline-charged rush that lured retail investors into so-called meme stocks. He also bought $1 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a further $1 million in silver. The GameStop position is now worth just $2 million, Sun said.

“I think I’m going to hold. Even if I lose money on the GME stock, I still believe this is a paradigm shift,” Sun said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “In the past we all followed the advice from the financial analysts, and these days people are going to make their own decisions.”

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Buy high never sell 💎🖐🦍

The Next Pandemic: Paper Portnoy Syndrome 🧻👐,131,liskoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liskoh/the_next_pandemic_paper_portnoy_syndrome/,34,1613217234.0,"Just as WSB's legacy can be divided into pre-Gee-Emm-Eee and post-Gee-Emm-Eee buying meme stonks will be soon divided into **Pre-Paper-Portnoy Eon** and **Post-Paper Portnoy Eon**. Another viral pandemic isnt due anytime soon due to vaccines. The next Pandemic that will cause the market to go sideways or nosedive is an emerging syndrome: **Paper Portnoy Syndrome**.

In effect, due to the influx of new degenerates, **Paper Portnoy Syndrome** has become prevalent amongst the retard and ape population. It is safe to presume going forward, every stonk on the front page will take off for a few seconds 🚀 before plumeting and crashing into the depths of the Pacific ocean, to join the **Lost City of Atlantis**.

Why might this be you ask? The answer is simple. Lets look at what tendencies **Paper Portnoys** exhibit that is counter-productive to the survival of meme stonks:

A) Buy high and sell low to ""mitigate"" losses. This was the **OG Paper Portnoy** who lost 700K on Gee-Emm-Eee when holding wouldve cost him 0$. Fuck these types might sell as soon as they see a dollar dip at open, locking in a loss instead of moving away from the screen and averaging down or holding.

B) Buy and sell upon seeing a slight gain at open thinking to be the next wolves of wallstreet with the few dollars they made. Much akin to **OG Paper Portnoy** raving he made money on a cannaboid stonk when he got fleeced the week earlier for 20X more than what he made.

As an anthropologist who has dedicated a college degree to studying apes, one of two things will cause the **Paper Portnoys** to go extinct and follow their Neanderthal ancestors to the trash cans of history:

A) Rallying bull market that teaches them how to [💎👐](https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone/) and 🚀🚀🚀

$RKT ready for take-off...,253,limbmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limbmv/rkt_ready_for_takeoff/,169,1613197261.0,"Warning this is HIGHLY speculative, but data points to it as a possibility.

First, Dan Gilbert and Warren Buffet are friends. This we know.

Second, according to the IPO, RHI (AKA Dan Gilbert) via the Class D shares retains 79% of the voting power, but currently has 94.2% of the economic interest based on his holdings of 94.2% of the total stock. It's therefore likely out of any deals he wishes to retain that 79% interest in the stock/voting(this becomes important later).

Third, between Berkshire's 13f filing on 11/16 (with a portion submitted separately as confidential), it was widely reported Buffet had plans for a ""secret"" investment, but how much and in what company?

The how much we know, the difference between their 13f and 10q filings (minus some foreign investments) is approximately $9 billion. Then there is the what? We do know his largest reductions were in bank stocks(the biggest reduction being in Wells Fargo), but does buffet really want to move away from finance or maybe he just wants to reposition in finance away from traditional banks.

If it's the latter, $RKT makes sense, but how do you buy $9 billion of a $40 billion company without anyone knowing? Timing....

$RKT reports on the 25th after various organizations have to report on the 16th (15th is a financial holiday). Over a 5% stake has to be reported within 10 days. RHI reported it's holdings early in the month. If RHI wants to they can convert 15.2%(94.2% - 79%) equivalent of the total outstanding stock from Class D to Class A in a private equity sale(AKA Black Book) so as not to directly affect the stock price, not report it for up to 10 days, and keep their 79% vote share/Economic interest. Then Berkshire can report their 13f and a bit later file their 10q on the purchase. With $RKT reporting the ""big partnership"" just before ER to maxmize momentum going in to it. 

Relationships, nummbers, dates for filing and chosen, all lead me to believe $RKT is the secret Buffet investment and plans to acquire about 25% of the company. This also means with four profitable quarters(the fourth being announce on the 25th) $RKT would also be eligible for S&P inclusion(due to the float increase) adding further value to the acquisition. All that plus the high short interest scrambling to get out(and Buffet followers scrambling to get in) and $RKT could soon be a multi-bagger in short order.

Note: 9 billion was likely based on the original $27 for 150 mil share original prospectus, but likely the deal changed after $RKT hasn't performed as well and likely the $1 billion buyback was announced to help that performance(Buffet thinks buybacks should be used for price support by companies so it follows his theory on their use).

Edit: I'd watch to see if the 13f still shows confidential as the lock-up didn't end until 02/02 and the transaction would likely be scheduled for the 16th so it doesn't need to be reported for 10 days, aka the 26th which just happens to be the day after RKT's ER call. Also, no other company has reported 5%+ new economic ownership by Berkshire since their Nov. 16th 13f.

Edit 2: It also makes sense from a non-investment business perspective. It would provide synchronicity with other Buffet holdings. It would help with Gieco(mortgage customers to Geico and Geico customers to RKT), Berkadia(multi-family/commercial lending which RKT doesn't handle), Berkshire Hathaway Automotive(sells cars, but doesn't handle direct financing, but RKT Auto does), Cavalier and Clayton homes(new homes which can be passed to RKT to increase sales there), and finally Home Services(realtor group).

 https://highflyinginvesting.com/2020/12/13/200121213_RKT/

Basically, Vanderbilt(BRK sub) buys Manufactured Home loans from RKT. That started in 2016(when RKT was Quicken) and was ongoing at least through 2018(after it became RKT).

Edit(02/16): Calls down big today, but still holding. I think today will be the bottom before the ER run-up.

Edit 2: Berkshire put out it's holdings as of 12/31. Looks like the ""Secret Position"" was a combo of Chevron and Verizon. Best I can tell nothing is currently marked ""Confidential"". 

ER is the next big event on 02/25 and the ""new financial partnership"" is likely to be announced then, but as to who it is, that's anybody's guess now. Today doesn't discount Berkshire, but it does mean RKT wasn't the ""confidential"" position.

Don’t worry guys, there is GREAT advice from Yahoo! Finance for all of you paper hand apes out there. 

Are you down thousands of dollars on GME, AMC, BB, or other meme stocks you got from WSB*? ALL you have to do is just cut your losses so that you can get tax-loss benefits and offset your gains. That’s it. Just sell at a loss. 

Of course, those stocks will tank even more and all the Institutional Investors who shorted them will probably get exactly what they want, but hey! At least you got some tax benefit. 


This post is 100% pure unadulterated sarcasm, but on the reals... if you need the money, hate the stock, or have Paper Hand Syndrome, sell your stock. 

As one Mark Cuban said... if you can afford to hold it and you like the stock, hold it.

 “Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[12] As Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a ""dead company"" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had. 
Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an ""enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'"".[12] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that that led to the turnaround of the company into a profitable mobile device producer,[13] valued at $6 billion in 2010.[12]
Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen's leadership”

Synapse’s story sounds familiar to blackberry’s. 

Chen’s done this before successfully and blackberry’s direction since losing the smartphone market has been successful and undervalued imo 

Now they’ve shook hands with Facebook and settled their dispute and shook hands with Amazon to develop and market software for cloud-connected vehicles, obviously the future for the automotive industry. Their security is industry leading at the moment, it’s not just automotive ...etc etc etc there’s lots of DD been posted explaining in detail 

I just thought it’s not bad having a CEO that’s successfully transitioned a ‘has been’ brand before (and raised its stock)  on top of the  currently undervalued services they provide 

I’m hoping bb’s price settles back down to around $6 again and I’ll buy more and go long

"Investing the stock market.

They make money by providing a marketplace and information services, so they're the Ebay of stocks. Except they make money getting companies listed rather than used clothes.

Going off the books, they're a little overvalued right now. Morningstar places their fair value at $99 and they closed at $111.02 today while their PE ratio is 29.67. However, they have steadily grown these last few years and I expect them to continue for one vital reason: A whole lot more investors are on the market.

Both with the explosion of discount brokers last year and the explosion of this sub in the last month means there's actually more money on the market. As new investors dip their toes in the water and/or recover from the pandemic unemployment that number will go up. Also, the rate of IPOs are also rising for the very reason there's a lot more interest in stocks now. The exchange's service is essential to the market so there's great security in that only the total collapse of civilization will make this company flop. The rising popularity of ETFs is also due to the market as a whole being good and growing. $ICE also consistently meets or exceeds earnings, but that's mostly an effect of having long term contracts for data and knowing in advance who's IPOing.

I don't have a position on $ICE yet but I will be opening a leveraged covered call in the next week or two when my current moves expire.",2021-02-13 10:24:40

CureVac (CVAC) making the coronavirus vaccine for Europoors and beyond,36,liodt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liodt0/curevac_cvac_making_the_coronavirus_vaccine_for/,41,1613203292.0,"I’m new, sort of. I joined a couple of years back and got turned off by all the rockets so I unsubscribed. I was reminded of WSB recently when I read a bestof post about someone who made enough money to pay for his dog’s surgery. WSB, making money? I got a flash back of all the rockets, of how I thought going long on Tesla was dumb, and cried inside when I compared to the stock price today. So I re-joined and promptly lost 2.5k with GME (my fault, got greedy). I regained it in weed plus a little extra, so we’re good. 



What to do with this fresh money?



I got curious about CureVac today as I read that they *“announced initiation of a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV, the company’s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage clinical testing.”* I looked into it, here are my notes: 



CureVac (CVAC) is German biotech with 20 years of experience but new on the stock market (IPOed in August 2020, current market cap 21.4bn).



They developed a COVID mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) but the CureVac can be shipped and stored at fridge temperature, a major logistics advantage compared to the others. It’s cheaper to store and transport and can also be used in poor countries that don't have the kind of cold storage the other mRNA vaccines need.



The vaccine is currently in phase 3 testing—a U.K. trial has finished enrolling 15,000 participants, and another global phase 2b/3 study aims to recruit more than 35,000 volunteers. (They already know it works and it’s safe so far; in Phase 3 they’re assessing how well it works plus more safety data.)



CureVac is in collaboration with the UK Government (the UK will provide them with scientific data regarding new strains), Bayer (to scale production of its vaccine, 160m doses) and GSK (to produce 100m doses and to jointly develop second generation vaccines).



The European Commission already has an order in for 405 million doses. It gave CureVac €75 million in funding to develop CVnCoV, adding to around €300 million provided by the German government.

The UK ordered 50m doses.



CureVac and partners expect to produce up to 300m doses in 2021 and up to 600m in 2022.



Whenever a new variant of the virus emerges, they can make a vaccine “update” in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, they're collaborating with GSK to make the second generation of vaccines (i.e. multivalent vaccines that cover multiple mutations of the coronavirus or multiple respiratory viruses). Such vaccines could become available 2022 subject to regulatory approval.



Other developments in the pipeline: rabies vaccine, and a couple of injectable drugs for skin and lung cancers in Phase 1 clinical trials (preliminary tests in humans). 



**Financials**

Being a newly listed company, there’s not much data to go with. I only found the *Third Quarter and First 9 Months 2020 Financial Results* on their website and didn’t look further. There’s probably a German website where you can find past balance sheet information for the company, but my German sucks. So I only go with this one report I found (first link in the list of sources). I nearly failed my accounting exam and probably only passed it because I cried, you better read the report yourself if you know how to read.


Comparison between Q1-Q3 2020 vs the same period in 2019:

Revenue: 43m (2020) vs 11m (2019)

Net loss: -71m vs -64m (despite spending 46m more in R&D in 2020)

Obviously, these are numbers before they start selling the vaccine (assuming it passes Phase 3). Trying to look at the future, I couldn’t find any info on the vaccine pricing or how much profit they expect to make per dose. But they’ve *“ruled out selling its inoculation at cost, arguing instead for an “ethical margin” for shareholders.”*. Comparatively, *“AstraZeneca and J&J have said they would not seek to profit from their vaccines, at least during the pandemic. “*



They have €892 million in cash as of September 30th, 2020 (from the German govt, the deal with GSK, the IPO and the grant/loan from the European Investment Bank). 



Major shareholders include the founder, the German government and one of the founders of SAP.

I’m an Europoor. I barely had the money to make this one call. I have no qualifications in finance or pharma. Don’t listen to me. Rockets.

I'll be bag holding the other 100 shares for the rest of my life before I fucking sell for a penny less than $420.69, but I got my money back out and took a little profit. I had wanted to buy calls on the Monday instead of shares, but I was too fucking dumb to figure out where I can trade US options from Europe. I still don't know. I literally setup a trading account at like 2am the night before to try to catch a seat on the rocket.

Even greater than the little bit of profit and free shares... what I've really gained... is the feeling that if I dedicate myself to this from now on... if I really focus... I too could one day become retarded.

If you don’t hold the stock for more than 12 months (capital gains law) then you will pay taxes at your prevailing tax bracket come tax time. Otherwise you only pay 15% on profits. 

So for all of you out there who made a shit ton on $GME and other meme stocks prepare to pay huge taxes on those. Especially if you have a Normal day job salary as well. I would hate to see a fellow WSB go to jail for not paying taxes. Don’t go spending that money quite yet because once tax season rolls around next may 2022 you might owe the government $50,000+ in taxes for that 6 figure profit you made off GameStop for example. Just hoping this doesn’t get deleted by the mods and can educate others. 

To get around this invest in companies that you want to hold for 12 months or more. Then you only pay 15% on taxes instead of potentially 60% (for top earners). Same goes for houses and any appreciating asset.",2021-02-13 09:24:23

"I can't believe I have to say this, but a lot of people need to hear it: THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR",980,line54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/,396,1613200303.0,"All I read now on ""new WSB"" is about how robinhood stopped the GME squeeze, and they ""robbed"" investors. ""This was going to $1,000, we got robbed!"" is every other damn post.

Now, personally, I don't buy that this is all a big conspiracy, and that all the brokers halted trading to save one hedge fund. As a long time trader (who has witnessed a lot of halts), it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked, and they protected themselves. But, I won't get into that, because that's not the point of this post.

This is the point:

THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR. Never has been, never will be. For example:

1) Big money has access to so much information you don't have. They have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune. They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate. Is that fair?

2) Big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals (and similar), and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you. Is that fair?

3) Big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing, that auto-trade for them. Is that fair?

4) Big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buying/selling. They can rotate between stocks and ETFs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing. Is that fair?

I could literally write a 500 point list, but my point is clear: the shit ain't fair. It's no secret. As a retail trader, you are a little guppy punk-ass bitch in a big dick shark pool.

*But we all know that.* It's never been about being fair, it's about profiting from the landscape that we are in.

If you buy into GME at $50, and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days, then you see some sketchy shit happening and think ""wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit..."" Then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry ""it's not fair,"" then you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the deal.

We know big money has the power to crash a stock, so if you see it happening, sell. Better yet, sell and switch to shorts, and play both sides. Don't lose all of your money and then claim the market isn't fair. No shit it isn't fair. What's your point? Profit off that unfairness, ya dumb bitch.

The millions of new WSBers all posting about how ""it isn't fair"" and ""we got robbed,"" it's basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss, then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money. Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.

And that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.

When I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.

You only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.

Am I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you. But in the meantime, accept what the market is *right now.* Don't throw you and your family's money away as a moral martyr, saying ""well i wouldn't have lost all my money if the market was different!"" It's not different. It is what it is.

And if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade. For your own sake.",2021-02-13 09:11:43

B) Buy and sell upon seeing a 10-20% gain thinking to be the next wolves of wallstreet with the 500$-1k they made

Cloudflare ($NET) is a web infrastructure and security company that [has a history of defending free speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They are one of the largest neutral cloud service providers in the U.S. and they innovate a lot in network security and product development.

**Beat earnings by 33%, price dropped 7%**

* Previous quarters they had performed much better, but beating expected EPS by 33% and losing 7% of its share price in a day just makes it a better value right now at $86.

**Price targets above $100 (Currently $86)**

* Many companies are [raising their price targets](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) anywhere between $90-$105.

**364% annual growth**

* They IPO'd at $15 a share for a $525M market cap, but immediately traded at $18. They have **363% growth in the past year**. There's plenty of growth left, especially if (when?) they strike a deal with a huge customer. They have [lots of new, innovative products](https://www.cloudflare.com/whats-new/) coming out *often*.

**Good for big companies**

* If a social media platform or news outlet needed a neutral cloud provider in 2021, Cloudflare has the infrastructure to support them.

**Good for small companies**

* They are liked by the tech community and offer free security services like [DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), [DNS encryption](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-to-keep-your-isps-nose-out-of-your-browser-history-with-encrypted-dns/), and [domain name hosting](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), making it ideal for getting customers early on. Very [ARK](https://ark-invest.com/invest-in-innovation/)\-esque IMO.

**History of defending free speech**

* Although they have cut ties with 8chan and The Daily Stormer from public pressure after violent attacks, Cloudflare has a [history of defending free speech even under scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They don't practice shadowbanning or act very partisan AFAIK.

Put it another way, if they are not profitable, they are literally selling dollar bills for .80 or less. If you think that's a winning strategy, send me your dollar bills right now goddammit!

And if anyone says to you that ""profitability isn't important, just look at amzn or tsla"" RUN! 

Yes there are other stats you can check but if your ape brain can only hold one thing at a time, remember free cash flow. .

The only way I can think of this going wrong is if a third company that is not publicly traded is introduced and becomes big enough to crash one of those existing businesses?

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Continental Automotive has a lot of potential for a long term play (if I knew how to do emojis I would put them here),13,lim3hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lim3hi/continental_automotive_has_a_lot_of_potential_for/,13,1613196575.0,"This is my first DD, and I'm a bit of a smooth brain so go easy on me.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

Their solution is literally the TOP and first to be easily available to start .

HYLN is working for the future, has the first mover advantage on it's field, NKLA is a scam and Tesla is not good for long mileage. Tesla I see covering the short distance of a few hundreds while HYLN solution will cover the need of trucking.


If you are still bear about HYLN , well, NKLA is triple the evaluation and is a much bigger scam team than HYLN.


Their last news put them back on map and people who like long bets should like HYLN.

GME price action DD: making higher lows and turning an ancient resistance into support,2328,lil9ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lil9ku/gme_price_action_dd_making_higher_lows_and/,302,1613194199.0,"- Pretty drawings: https://ibb.co/72gkwv7

The tits pattern is shaping up nicely.

Using nerds lingo, it could be a double cup and handle and not just a double bottom as previously suggested.

For the pattern to be confirmed, we shouldn't have any drops below $49. A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.

- Tops and bottoms

Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.

But guys, we're making higher lows. That's big.

They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.

Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That's our short term goal.

Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.

- History repeating itself

It looks like we're losing, but we're not.

When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.

Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what's happening right now.

$ZOM 's smart play,72,lil7ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lil7ba/zom_s_smart_play/,39,1613194016.0,"It has been accurately pointed out that Zomedica is wildly overvalued for what it does. The total market for its only current product is worth less than the current company valuation.

What caught my attention was the very interesting move they pulled when their stock exploded. They dumped 91 million fresh shares into the market, blunting the still massive surge in stock price and capturing a huge windfall in the process. Now they're sitting on over $180 million dollars in cash to fund R&D and diversify with.

To me this looks like they are positioned to diversify their products and expand well out of their initial niche, unless they pocket it all in the form of bonus checks and run. It makes me think that we're just waiting for them to announce that they're working on a new a product in a bigger market and they'll go nuts again.

What do the big brains here think?

Novo Nordisk (NVO) - Boomer safety stock with tendie potential (DD... ish),23,lil20p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lil20p/novo_nordisk_nvo_boomer_safety_stock_with_tendie/,37,1613193610.0,"So, I just got 20 Novo Nordisk shares at market open for a year long play, after watching it since Wednesday. Here's why: Ozempic


If anyone in your house has Boomer cable news, then the commercial jingle would be familiar to you. (Oh-oh-oh-Ozempic-oh-oh). It's a diabetes drug that's about to explode in value later this year.


For anyone who doesn't know how drug regulation works, clinical trials are needed before the FDA will approve a drug as being safe and effective for a given indication. 


Currently Ozempic has been approved for diabetes only. Their current commercials mention that you ""may"" lose weight on the drug. They can't advertise that you ""will definitely lose weight"", because the FDA hasn't approved it for that specific indication... yet.


On Wednesday Novo Nordisk released information that their post marketing clinical trial of Ozempic proved that it could help you achieve weight loss at an average rate of around 15kg (~30 pounds) per year without a change in diet or lifestyle. Once they submit this data to the FDA, Novo will have the world's first ""thin pill"", and they can start marketing it to young women instead of just diabetic Boomers.


Of course the catch is that if you stop taking it, the weight comes back, so you have to be a customer for life... or change your lifestyle.


When the news came out on Wednesday the stock jumped $2 immediately and has been rising since. I watched it for a day thinking it might decline, but no such luck, it's going steadily up. It's a Boomer stock so low risk/low reward for now, but if this drug can be approved this year (looking likely), then it'll be great for their earnings. I think it'll be the next Viagra.

$OPEN - DISRUPTING THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY 🚀🚀,19,likqvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/likqvz/open_disrupting_the_real_estate_industry/,94,1613192739.0,"TL;DR 📈📈📈 SHARES CALLS LEAPS ETC. MONTHS OUT YEARS OUT WHO CARES WILL 🚀🪐💫

Disclosure: this was all taken and edited from u/krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it - also I’m not an investment advisor 

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings, fixing up their house or repair negotiations, buyer’s demands, doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama, have to deal with realtors, or even pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%) Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.
Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could be valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market. As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**CONCERNS:**

**WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Assets. This simply can't happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

**WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**ISN’T THIS JUST UBER FOR HOUSES**

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash, Uber, etc... 

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

Once again after a change of management. All stores in operations still, it declared chapter 15 bankruptcy and took the stock price from 14 to 5 just because the word bankruptcy scared people without most knowing the difference with a chapter 15 and chapter 7 or 11.

I just bought 50k worth yoloing at $6 each and wondering what you guys think of Luckin Coffee and it’s possible revival/re-listing to Nasdaq.

No restrictions. No insider data selling to hedges. Fair playground. Transparent transactions. No one thought about that?

Step one: on Thursday night or Friday afternoon go on your favorite investing/trading subreddits and find around 15 tickers.

Step two: write each ticker down on a piece of paper and hang all the pieces of paper in a wall.

Step three: get three different color darts and correspond each color with 5%,10%, or 15% this will represent how much of your portfolio you will put into each ticker.

Step four: throw the darts at the wall and proceed to put the money into each ticker.

Step five: On each ticker once you reach a good profit sell.

Step six: Go back to step one and repeat for infinite money.

My current moonshot tickers I found this way are $RKT & $BB.

So far so good.",2021-02-13 05:59:36
$OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 1) 🚀🚀🚀,54,liixp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixp0/osk_oshkosh_to_infinity_and_beyond_part_1/,69,1613187664.0,"I will be writing a series of DD posts for OSK. I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.

Oshkosh’s Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.

Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire & emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.

The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didn’t facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom). 

During Wilson’s tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isn’t just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you can’t do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))

Wilson and the OSK team aren’t satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wife’s boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.

The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.

In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didn’t plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,5015,liixji,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liixji/blackberry_is_not_a_meme_stock/,626,1613187650.0,"It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

And again...

**BlackBerry’s Market Cap: $7.3B**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

So, you retards are telling me to sell my undervalued stock to buy *OVERVALUED* stock?! LMAOOO 💎🙌🏻🚀

EDIT 3: Position is 500 shares @ $20.35, and no, I did not make this post to “recover losses.” Please, if you are a cynic, do yourself a favor and realize that not everyone is cynical.",2021-02-13 05:40:50
"Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL",368,liiuko,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiuko/exposing_sundial_growers_ticker_sndl/,300,1613187427.0,"Please put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.

Of course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.

I'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.

Fair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...

Here are some reasons:

**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**

I won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the ""next"" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump & Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.

If you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy and walk away with cash and hand.

**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**

Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.

A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \[1\]

1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)
2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.
3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \[2\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.

**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**

This is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.

This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \[3\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.

**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**

If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.

Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \[4\].

This is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.

**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)

Some guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 25,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\[redacted company name\]**,**\[redacted company name\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.

**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**

It's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can turn **$20 million cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.

However they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.

I'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say ""Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit"". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.

**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**

The institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.

Instead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**

By the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Showing really large capital on their filings (which actually disappear the day after) would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. It's no wonder why a small company with 90% of their capital lost would want their financials looking a bit crisper on their sec filings.

**H. MAGIC NUMBER**

If all of this is lost on you, at least realize that they potentially have a $690 million deficit if my math is right.

EDIT: I don't have any positions in the company expiring today, nor do I think them staying on will stop the inevitability of my position making money. I could exit it now at a profit if I wanted to. It's a principled matter at this point, and more of a warning about some misinformation I've seen posted here regarding their financials. Just check the sec filings if you want to make your own decision. Don't trust what I say, trust the facts.

EDIT 2: I think I actually found some proof of price manipulation and insider trading. In the picture attached, you can clearly see that $5C for SNDL randomly bounced up in price midday on January 27th, two days before a registered offering. Viewing the $5C as opposed to a lower value call allows you to see the most highly volatile moments, since the less extreme side of option chains  are often more easily obscured by normalization of daily trading

To put this into perspective there are 3 players in the 5g scene: Ericsson ($ERIC), Huawei (Private chinese company), and Nokia ($NOK). The US government isnt really allowing Huawei into the 5g scene on US soil so that really only leaves two companies... not three.

Oil Stocks - Summer 2021,75,liibyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liibyy/oil_stocks_summer_2021/,153,1613186006.0,"Hey everyone! I understand that I may get bashed or called a boomer for this, but I would like to discuss the possibility of oil stocks making a recovery this summer. While the popular consensus is that clean energy is taking over (Teslas on the road, Amazon using electric trucks, fuel economy improvements, federal EV mandates, pipelines being banned, etc.), and I agree with this consensus long term (by 2030), I don't think oil is going anywhere in the short term.

Back in early November 2020, oil stocks started climbing their way back to their pre-covid averages, but most have not reached their pre-covid averages and some have almost 50% more to grow (such as Suncor or British Petroleum). My thought process is that with Covid vaccines rolling out/restrictions letting up, we will see increases in summer travel and an increase in manufacturing (which often requires oil). This paired with climbing oil prices will bring an increase in oil stocks in my opinion.

For a well thought out bull/bear thesis on oil see this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lhwmhu/the_bull_bear_case_for_oil/

As of now, it looks like summer calls or 2022/2023 leaps on oil stocks are pretty cheap. 

What do you guys think? Will oil stocks rebound to pre-covid averages this summer or not?",2021-02-13 05:13:26
A tip for fellow retards: Dry Bulk,32,lii12k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lii12k/a_tip_for_fellow_retards_dry_bulk/,47,1613185239.0,"Now I can't bother to write an essay about it, so I'm not flaring this as DD, but here's my suggestion. Load up on dry bulk shipping stock.

Sector is booming strongly for a few months and is expected to go higher for the next few more. Dry bulk companies were severely undervalued due to periods of long depression the last few years.

Just today Diana had a 25% spike. Safe Bulkers a 12% and Star Bulk 15%. I expect this to go quite a bit higher. A couple days ago Castor had its day in the sun with a staggering spike, but these companies here are even better value, as they are well established, well managed and with large fleets.

Now keep in mind it is a volatile sector and some dry bulk stocks have been prone to manipulation before, so do your own research.

AMD currently has the fastest chips and outsources production to TSM. AMD producing their own chips is not something that’s going to happen overnight so I wouldn’t call it a yolo play, but they certainly have a lot to gain here. 

NVDA and INTC could potentially gain from this as well, but I felt that AMD has the most to gain with their recent supply issues. Intel already has their own foundries and NVDA seems to be doing a little better with Samsung’s foundry.",2021-02-13 04:33:16

$PLTR the pinnacle of earnings pressure and why you should buy/hold.,198,lihawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lihawl/pltr_the_pinnacle_of_earnings_pressure_and_why/,121,1613183332.0,"This is my first write up I’ll be doing, I know that this account is new but I have never bothered to hop on reddit until recently. My goal with this is to shed light on PLTR’s current situation and the likely bounce back it’ll have soon. Please forgive any ape like sentence structuring, I haven’t had my daily crayon. 

Firstly let’s talk about why PLTR is plummeting right now, the potential it has going forward and why buying now is probably one of the last chances with entry at a heavy discount.

Some useful notes (all of these values are intra-day and were grabbed as of writing time, they may have changed):

*Current price: $31.99

*Lowest point this week was today: $31.99

*Highest point this week: $39.15

*Highest point all time: $44.45

Currently PLTR has been dropping HARD in value from the recent highs it hit and somehow the bleeding hasn’t stopped. People have been shorting and selling this stock left and right out of panic that the earnings, long weekend and the lockout will cause a major dip in the price. We all know how the markets work, panic and sell first, think second. Now, here’s why the long term benefits outweigh the short term panic.

PLTR has such a unique offering compared to some of the stocks “booming” right now and we already know when they receive new partnerships the price peaks above $38+. The lowest point has been hit now, the stock likely will spike if earnings are good even if it does not immediately, we can expect another partnership to make the price boom.

It’s also worth noting analysts that aren’t as stupid as me are setting the price target to at-least $40-55. There’s also articles speculating the earnings will be better then the previous quarter report. 

All in all please do your own DD and research before blinding trusting me.

Link to article speculating earnings will be fine/better:
https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/palantirs-pltr-top-line-shape-132101801.html

I truly believe anyone investing and holding now will see HUGE reward coming into next week or the week after.

My position:
PLTR/29 units at $32.02.

Thanks for coming to my ape talk.

EDIT: To anyone asking about my new account I can’t reply in the comments due to auto mod. So I’ll leave this notice here for now, I joined Reddit after WSB blew up after GME. I wanted to remain anonymous so that’s why my name is so generic. I only expected to lurk but I couldn’t help myself.

EDIT 2: Someone asked why I only have 29 shares, it’s called being broke. Trust me if I had the money I would be investing more into this.

EDIT 3: My thoughts on the lockup expiry detailed: Since the lockup expires 3 days after the earnings report there will likely still be a jump in price right after earnings before preemptively dropping again. Likely some institutes will sell for profits but I doubt many will following a -15% week. The price will climb shortly after panic settles!",2021-02-13 04:28:52
"GME Gains. Started with $4,500 in November, >1.5 mil in February.",5421,lih2mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lih2mv/gme_gains_started_with_4500_in_november_15_mil_in/,855,1613182694.0,"https://imgur.com/a/RDa86Np

Started in November with $4,500 that I cash advanced from my credit card and saved by paying my rent with that card for 2 months. I initially bought 75% shares and 25% calls and just pressed buttons on my phone a few times here and then for the next couple months. I didn't want to post this until GME wounds started healing for others. I did, however, go down with the ship in my Fidelity where I lost about 25k on shares. Nothing I did was smart, I got lucky. DON'T FUCKING GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. THERE WAS 1 SPOT IN 10 MILLION WHERE THAT SHIT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I ALREADY TOOK IT. Please don't test your luck because you will lose your shirt and your wife will go stay with her boyfriend permanently. Otherwise, keep those Wendy's Tendies flowing you fucking retards.

Edit 1: Getting a lot of PM's asking for money. Bitch, I'd love to help everybody and will be making sizeable donation to charities and bringing video games to kids for Christmas. However, I don't just have cash everywhere. I actually adjusted my quality of life DOWNWARDS. Also, if you wanna PM me to ask where to learn about options, you better have some experience in business, logistics, trucking or brokering freight, so you can return the favor. I need help with something so tit for tat.

Edit 2: Got a lot of people messaging me asking about what shall not be named i.e. rule 4. If you are interested in that, you can go through my post history.

Edit 3: Can't I get a flair or something for being an absolute retard?

Edit 4: Yes people, this was my FIRST play in the stock market, I'm not a guru that could do this again. The first's one's always free or at least it was in my case! I am lucky, not skilled.

Edit 5: The week of the gamma squeeze, I was up to 90k. I pulled out 46k which was more than 10 times my initial investment. Had I not done that, I would not have had the balls to make this play. My best advice, **SET YOURSELF UP FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN PLAY RISKY LIKE THIS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE STILL BETTER OFF THEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED!!!**

Edit 6: Volatility. How did I not wanna die with such large fluctuations? Well sometimes I did, that's what the liquor was for. Otherwise, as you can probably tell, I was born in the bytecorn space but way out of even the top 25 or 100 corns. I'm talking microcap that would put even the worst copperstonks to shame. This volatility pales in comparison and I became comfortable there, sometimes even happy. Learn to hold onto your pants trading the most volatile asset known to man, and options will be a walk in the park.  Also, I learned a ton about greed and chasing gains in the pop of 2017. Lessons to be learned can be found everywhere, it's up to you to determine how much you wanna pay to learn those lessons.",2021-02-13 04:18:14

Institutional ownership of $PLTR up 50% in Feb in the run up to earnings,392,ligzaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ligzaw/institutional_ownership_of_pltr_up_50_in_feb_in/,180,1613182473.0,"EDIT: Changed flair to DD. Apologies to the Mods if it's not acceptably thorough. And wow! Thank you for the awards, my first on Reddit!

I've been invested in Palantir since it DPO'd last year, originally bought in at just below the $10 mark, and made some good money in a couple of accounts after its first run up. I'm convinced the stock is going to hit $100 at some point (obviously I hope it'll be this year, but as a long term play, it doesn't matter too much).

I've been keeping an eye on the institutional ownership of Palantir here: [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr)

At the end of last year, there were about 193 institutional investors holding shares of Palantir, for a total of 12.39% of the float. During January, the number of institutions steadily increased, but the percentage that they held really didn't go up that much. It wasn't until February that institutional ownership passed the 13% mark.

Today, we're at 371 institutional owners (344 yesterday), and the institutional ownership has shot up past 18%.

Earnings for $PLTR is Tuesday before market open (note: the market is closed on Monday, so today's the last day before earnings if you're waiting to jump in). A lot of people tend to sell in the run up to earnings, as the hype is a good opportunity to take profits. What I'm seeing today is that the institutions are basically buying the dip. They missed their chance to take advantage of a crazy IPO, but they're not going to miss the chance to make money off a company that is most likely going to fly in the next 12 months.

This year has seen positive news every week for Palantir, and I think that even if the earnings report itself isn't amazing, the guidance for the year ahead is going to make the stock fly.

ETFs are generally safer/slower, but Roundhill’s other ones (BETZ; NERD; DEEP) all went up 100+% over the year, starting around where SUBZ is now. I’m also a fan of Netflix and while I think streaming might slow down as things open back up, I think people have become accustomed to them, and that people overestimate the desire to go back to watching movies in person rather than from the comfort of a couch, or in a friend’s living room. 

I don’t know shit, but this seems like a decent ETF to get into now and watch it slowly double over the course of the year, so you have a safe slow burn account to hedge your bets against.

Obviously I went in on this one and am biased and want it to go up, but I don’t think it can be as subject to pump and dumps or volatility because it’s an ETF and it would take mountains to move it, IMO",2021-02-13 04:00:42

OMG Goldman Sachs lowers rating of a stock that they screwed over and are being sued,179,lig4v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig4v4/omg_goldman_sachs_lowers_rating_of_a_stock_that/,27,1613180299.0,"On July 26, 2018, United Natural Foods (UNFI) and SuperValue (SVU) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which UNFI would acquire SuperValue for $32.50 per share in cash, or approximately $2.9 billion, including the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities. Goldman Sachs was the investment bank that advised UNFI to acquire SuperValue.

On October 20, 2018 Goldman Sachs lowers its rating on UNFI to 'SELL' after the acquisition was complete. Why would Goldman Sachs lower its rating on a company they just advised. If the SuperValue deal was good for UNFI (per Goldman's advice) shouldn't this mean a positive outlook for the stock?

[UNFI Analyst Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/zg6i8c3jv2h61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=87512c5f83f33b8f940e91ebe71b6bd48e9f681e)

In 2019, [UNFI filed a multi-count lawsuit](https://unfilitigationfacts.com/case-overview/) against Goldman Sachs to recover damages and recoup ill-gotten gains stemming from its improper conduct during the period in which it advised UNFI on the $2.9 billion acquisition of SuperValue.

Goldman Sachs used its market power and influence to exploit UNFI as part of a concerted effort to maximize the Bank’s profits.

UNFI asserted that Goldman Sachs made material misrepresentations and omissions of fact to induce the Company to accept their demand that SuperValue be added as a co-borrower on the Term Loan. They told UNFI that the impact would be minimal. But the truth is that the effect of adding SuperValue as a co-borrower caused significant harm to UNFI because the change was part of an unlawful *quid pro quo* between the Bank and credit default swap holders to solidify their participation in the Term Loan. The co-borrower adjustment spurred an artificial and significant spike in the value of CDS protection contracts held by the Bank’s hedge fund clients.

If this is not market manipulation, I don't know what is. And you guys thought Melvin was bad...

**TL;DR** Goldman fucked UNFI, lowered their rating to sell, the stock is not trading at fair value due to manipulation.

**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)

* Total Revenue of $376.6 million
* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million
* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million
* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%
* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million
* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million

We can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin >20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x.

**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits.

That speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think ""oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber.""

**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be.

**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival.

Also, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies. She always gives me the tendies, and sometimes I give one back to her in return.",2021-02-13 03:36:44

The future of semiconductors and why Intel is poised to win the war,4,liekzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liekzg/the_future_of_semiconductors_and_why_intel_is/,135,1613176157.0,"While you incestuous smooth brained degenerates have been getting fiddled by wall street, always late to plays, ""hodling"" (this is fucking retarded) literal trash like weed stonks GME and feeding overvalued tech companies that never turned a profit. While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

So if legal of your company is saying its a rumor, then how would that be considered insider trading if you invest in a company you don't work for that rumor has it is buying your company? Also what if I invest in that public company?",2021-02-13 03:31:32

I've started by buying these contracts on RH and have been paying an average of .14 or even .15 just to get filled. I've had a few .13 filled, but the bid in the quote below are my 7 for my Robinhood account. I'm very eager to buy these contracts, so while I wait for that to fill, I started buying on Fidelity in my IRA. As you can see, I bought 91 contracts where I put in a limit order for .15, and Fidelity was able to get them filled at .13. ALL WHILE MY .13 ROBINHOOD ORDER ISN'T FILLING.

I paid $.65 in commission for Fidelity but they are filling, where as I'd have to move my Robinhood order up to .14 or .15 just to fill, costing even more than the Fidelity commission. Holy shit, here's the proof of just how terrible we're all getting fucked by Robinhood. It's been 10 minutes and I'm still waiting on RH to fill. This is unbelievable.

Sitting here, scratching your head trying to figure out what's the next play that'll 🚀your portfolio to the 🌕?

I had started initiating a position in this earlier this month, then /u/dhsmatt2 posted his own yolo on it. Confirmation bias confirmed! We’re off to the 🌕See his post here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lien2t/tendies_is_spelled_trivago_250000_yolo/)

$TRVG is now back above $1bn market cap. It was worth nearly 3x as much a year ago.

Expedia is the majority shareholder in the company, so it's definitely not going to disappear.

This quarter the company announced that they managed to cut expenses by 71% versus 2019, bringing their overall cash burn down to about 10 million dollars.

They're sitting on about 250-300 million in cash on hand, so that's enough for them to last **5 years** with out having to grow sales at all. 🚀🚀🚀

They're a MUCH leaner business than they were coming into the pandemic, and they'll be primed to benefit once sales start to increase coming out of this. 🚀🚀🚀

They aren't an Airline with billions of dollars in planes sitting on the ground, so they'll be able to pivot into profitability very quickly. 🚀🚀🚀

The ""Worst case"" scenario here is that Expedia buys out the remaining shares. If this were to happen, they won't be buying them back for less than 6-8$.

Shares have been trending upwards since they announced earnings earlier this week.

Call premiums are pricing in IV of 200%+, so this is definitely a play where you buy shares.

At the current valuation, we're getting to buy a company that normally generates a billion dollars in revenues for a cash adjusted price of $800 mil

Even more beautiful, the majority of their revenues were previously generated by companies Expedia owns. Booking holdings (Expedia's competitor) has been increasing the amount of business they've been sending to Trivago and as a % of business, Booking holdings has been referring more in 2020 vs 2019.

Liability note: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD. This is a stock I like a LOT

TLDR: Trivago's biggest client is Expedia group, Trivago's biggest shareholder is Expedia. Booking holdings, Expedia's competitor has been sending $TRVG more business. Costs are down 71% year over year, so a ""new"" leaner company coming out of the pandemic, with LOTS of pent-up travel demand. Shares are cheap, but won't be for long. In the time I typed this up, they rose from $2.80 to just under 3$.

Position: 16 000 shares, 20x 5$ march calls, 10x April 5$ calls 50x July 5$ calls.

NrdRage’s Friday DD: There’s still one meme stock that’s not dead yet. I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB),331,liezfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liezfr/nrdrages_friday_dd_theres_still_one_meme_stock/,94,1613177289.0,"Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.
