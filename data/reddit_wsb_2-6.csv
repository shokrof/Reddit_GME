100% proof that Melvin are shaking in their shorts a lesson in advanced economic theories.,4,ldccts,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldccts/100_proof_that_melvin_are_shaking_in_their_shorts/,0,1612575146.0,"**Prospect Theory:** ***THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK***The prospect theory can also be known as the loss-aversion theory. Prospect theory states that people's perceptions of gain and loss are skewed. That is, people are more afraid of a loss than they are encouraged by a gain. If people are given a choice of two different prospects, they will pick the one that they think has less chance of ending in a loss, rather than the one that offers the most gains.

**Rational Expectations Theory:**The rational expectations theory states that the players in an economy will act in a way that conforms to what can logically be expected in the future. Based on the Prospect Theory above, Hedge Funds are expecting you to act rationally (sell when a stock goes down). **Instead if you hold IT BREAKS THE SYSTEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.**

**The Odd Lot Theory:**The odd lot theory uses the sale of odd lots – small blocks of stocks held by individual investors – as an indicator of when to buy into a stock. Investors following the odd lot theory buy in when small investors sell out. The main assumption is those small investors are usually wrong. **THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND HOW THEY ARE COLLUDING WITH OTHER HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU TO SELL.**

**Greater Fool Theory:**The greater fool theory proposes that you can profit from investing as long as there is a greater fool than yourself to buy the investment at a higher price. This means that you could make money from an overpriced stock as long as someone else is willing to pay more to buy it from you. **HEDGE FUNDS THINK YOU ARE ALL FOOLS, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL TO THEM SO THEY CAN DRIVE THE PRICE BACK UP.**

&#x200B;

THEY WANT TO WIN, THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERYONE.

It's so easy to see if you look at a 10 day chart with Bollinger Bands and check the Bollinger Bands Crossover and Bollinger Band Percent B. The correlation trending indicator will show you exactly what I wrote in the Odd Lot theory.

It becomes even more obvious when you put overlay a VWAP to the Typical Price on a 30 day chart. You can use this to identify the regression divergence which results in the recursive media oscillator. When you look at it you'll notice the short stair and short ladder attacks are rampant this week.

CARMAT AESON ARTIFICAL ❤️HEART❤️ DD 🚀,4,ldcbtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldcbtu/carmat_aeson_artifical_heart_dd/,0,1612575076.0,"# 1. WHO IS CARMAT ?

CARMAT was founded by Alain Carpentier in 2008, he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in Europe in 1986. He is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques.

The biggest player behind this company is Airbus which co-founded it.

# 2. WHO IS AESON ?

Aeson was a king of Iolcus in ancient Greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market (UE). It’s currently the only product of CARMAT.

# 3. WHO IS ALCAR ?

ALCAR is the ticker name on Euronext. (For retards who can’t buy EU stocks go to chapter 10 )

# 4. CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATIONS ON THIS AESON ?

You need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices :

1. **LVAD** Left Ventricular Assist Device
2. **RVAD** Right Ventricular Assist Device
3. **BiVAD** Biventricular Assist Device
4. **TAH** Total Artificial Heart

As a retard you would think that TAH is amazing and so Aeson should be category 4. This not the case. Aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category :

* **PHRT** Physiologic Heart Replacement Therapy

This is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task, there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with Aeson in the near future  (>10 years)

So why is this AESON so fucking amazingly advanced ?

1. **Pulsatility :** The artificial heart mimics a real heart with 2 pumps, 2 ventricles, 4 valves.
2. **Autoregulation :** The embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs. (It automatically adjusts if the patient walks, runs, sleeps, etc.. ; like a real heart)
3. **Hemocompatibility :** All the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible.

Compared to other similar cardiac medical devices,Aeson is really safe. It is the only one which didn’t provoke any stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site (This artificial heart still uses an external battery) in any of the study participants.

# 5. SO CAN AESON BE USED COMMERCIALLY IN EU AND US RIGHT NOW ?

Not so fast, not so fast...

If it was 100% the case, the rocket would already have launched a long time ago !

There is 4 uses category for this device type :

1. **BTR**  Bridge To Recovery
2. **BTT**  Bridge To Transplantation
3. **BTB**  Bridge To Bridge
4. **DT**  Destination Therapy

The final target is DT ( Destination Therapy ), which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant. In December 2020, Carmat received CE marking for BTT.

It means that it can be used, for now, as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real ❤️ transplantation but are still on the waiting list. Carmat, genius as they are, will also use the data from BTT patients to push for the DT.

The first commercial implants are going to be in Germany in Q2 2021 as they are ready to reimburse it.

In parallel, another study (EFICAS) is starting in France in Q2 2021 to drive Aeson adoption, support the value proposition and mainly to get French reimbursement.

In the US, They are starting the EFS (Early Feasibility Study) in Q1 2021 (now). 3 centers in the US are already trained and ready to implant their first patients.

# 6. OK COOL ! BUT WHAT IS THE MARKET SIZE ?

Currently the EU market for BTT is estimated to be of a minimum size of 2000 patients / year.

Right now Germany is the focus as it represents 40% of the EU market (800). France is following with 14% of the market (280). The competitors did less than 60 interventions in Germany and France last year on this type of patient (BVAD / Syncardia). Which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products aren’t really as convincing which can explain their small volumes.

The combined EU-US market for DT is estimated to be around 180’000 / year.

On these 180’000 patients, around 3.3% are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around 5’500. Which gives a market size of 174’500.

The market size is also growing each year for multiple reason :

* Ageing of population (boomers dying)
* The fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent. (not fat shaming intended)
* The number of real ❤️ transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system (thanks daddy elon). An estimated 33% of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions.

# 7. BUT CAN CARMAT PRODUCE ALL THESE HEARTS ?

Carmat finished building its first factory in France last year. It will be soon able to produce  **800 ❤️/ year**. As we see the current EU BTT market is large enough for this first factory.

The timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the CE destination therapy marking and the BBT / DT FDA approval.

With the EU BTT market and current production capabilities, Carmat can partially finance the future studies, it’s development needs and new factories. This can prevent too much share dilution.

It is possible that for future factories in the US, Carmat could partner up with a big name (Edwards, Medtronic, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientifics, etc... ). A partnering would give Carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in Uncle Sam Country.

# 8. LET’S SPEAK $$ /  REVENUES  / VALUATION  (QUALITY MATH ECONOMICS TIME )

**SOURCES OF REVENUES**

The 2 main sources of revenues for CARMAT are going to be :

* **Sales of Aeson :** We are going to do a conservative estimate of the price of AESON at $150’000 which is more or less the current price of the less advanced Syncardia TAH (the LVAD is $100’000 but not really comparable)
* **Aeson maintenance :** They can be conservatively estimated to be around $10’000/year

**REVENUES ESTIMATES**

* **Short term revenues estimates**, I am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory -> 800 ❤️ per year. I won’t be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only BTT category is used.
* **Medium term revenues estimates,** I’m going to use a pessimistic 5% market share.
* **Long term revenues estimates 1**, I’m going to go with the number of 25’000 heart which was a minimal target by the Prof. Christian Latrémouille, currently Director of Surgical Affairs at Carmat. This is still only 14% of market share on a market without real competition, it can still be seen as conservative
* **Long term revenues estimates 2,** I’m going to go with an arbitrary but realistic  30% market share.

For mid and long term, I’m going to use a conservative 5 years average survival rate for maintenance revenues (It should be a much longer)

&#x200B;

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*REVENUES*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM (BTT ONLY):|800❤️ x $150’000|$120M|
|MID TERM|(0.05\*174’500)❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000))|$1B|
|LONG TERM 1|25’000❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000))|$5B|
|LONG TERM 2|(0.3\*174’500)❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000)|$10.5B|

**CARMAT VALUATION (P/S RATIO ADVANCED ANALYSIS)**

We are going to do a quick autistic but realistic valuation of CARMAT by comparing its revenues to 2 random companies in more or less the same sector (P/S ratio).

* SARTORIUS P/S = 13  (4 FEB 2021)
* ABIOMED P/S = 18  (4 FEB 2021)

From This let’s take a pessimistic starting P/S of 12 for our beloved CARMAT

My advance prediction model also predict a lowering P/S when the company gets bigger. (Because most of the times the growth is slowing(which wouldn’t necessary be the case for carmat… but whatever)) -> I thereby announce a pessimistic -2 P/S for each row in the following table (for big brain people : P/S = ((7-n)\*2)

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*VALUATION*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM|$120M \* 12(P/S)|$1.44B|
|MID TERM|$1B \* 10(P/S)|$10B|
|LONG TERM 1|$5B \* 8(P/S)|$40B|
|LONG TERM 2|$10.5B \* 6(P/S)|$63B|

**SO HOW MUCH MY SHARES WILL BE WORTH ?**

**Currently there is 12.7M shares each worth $36 (4 FEB 2021)** for a total ridicul valuation of 457M (20 times less than fraud NKLA)

In mid / late 2021 there will probably be a share dilution to finance the future growth. But don’t worry, it will only help it to produce more ❤️. Let’s say they add a big amount of 2M shares between each row because why not and we are trying to do pessimistic revenues.

&#x200B;

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*SHARE PRICE*|*RETURN*|*ROCKET RATING*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM|$1.44B / 14.7M|$98|**172%**|🚀|
|MID TERM|$10B / 16.7M|$598|**1561%**|🚀🚀|
|LONG TERM 1|$40B / 18.7M|$2139|**5842%**|🚀🚀🚀|
|LONG TERM 2|$63B / 20.7M|$3043|**8350%**|🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|

&#x200B;

# 9. OK I SMELL TENDIES ! BUT WHAT ELSE ?

* The US EFS won’t cost a dime as carmat will get paid for each used ❤️.
* There are a lot of catalysts on the calendar this year. (first us implantation, first german commercial implantation, etc...)
* The margin on medical devices is huge (Stefan Piat (CARMAT CEO) is targeting 70% 🚀 )
* The market size I used only takes into account the current AESON which by its size can’t fit into your wife's chest neither in her asian boyfriend chest. Carmat is already working on a smaller ❤️ which would more than double the market size (Women + Asia) 🚀🚀
* I spoke about the market growth but didn’t took it into account in my advanced model 🚀🚀
* Stephan Piat had a high level job in Johnson & Johnson and Abbott, good relations can help sweet deals to be made. 🚀

# 10. BUT THE STOCK IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPOOR...

Stocks in europoor are worldwide famous for having a low valuation. Which is in fact a good occasion to get it before it comes to the US where valuation is without any known limits (🚀) !

When asked about a NASDAQ introduction, Stefan Piat answered (6.jan 2021): ”It makes a lot of sense, it really is on the table” .

# 11. BUT I NEVER INVEST IN BIOTECH COMPANIES WHICH STILL NEED AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT !

It’s true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors. But if you followed carefully (which you didn’t), you would have understood that even in the improbable event that Carmat can’t have the DT (again really improbable, more a question of when), my model shows that Carmat would still be worth more than 36$ a share solely on taking into account the EU BTT market.

# 12. LAST WORD

It is important to understand that, currently, only 25 to 45% of the 180’000 yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year. Aeson is not a comfort medical device, it is a necessity for a lot of people. There is no real competition and there won’t be before a long time. This product is the result of more than 12 years of research and studies made by worldwide specialists. In my opinion, it is really hard to see Karma(t) not succeed in the next few years.

Green energy is going to be a booming industry in the next few years as the climate situation comes more into the American social consciousness. Though I'm not expecting much from the Biden administration, they have rejoined the Paris Agreement. Additionally, loud progressives and Bernie Sanders as the head of the Senate Budget Committee points towards climate action being addressed soon. When this happens, it will probably take the form of requiring energy providers to overhaul their energy sources to renewable resources. This has been done recently at the state level, and the US government likes to work off of precedent.

As a zoomer, there are sever things I feel like I understand about Americans and about the American economy. **Americans pay for convenience, and they'd rather not think about the hard stuff.** This can be shown from the continued embrace of Amazon, to every mom and pop shop that gets shut down when a walmart opens up in town. So what happens when an electricity company decides to tell it's customers that they should use solar panels to help save them money? What happens when those customers aren't just residential customers but businesses with bigass roofs as well? **They save money.**

[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/solar-panel-cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/solar-panel-cost)

 And guess what people like to do? Exactly.  

Sunrun has become the second largest solar company in the US since opening in 2007, and sells itself as a company that takes care of all the hard shit for the customer. 

""Once a customer decides to proceed with the installation, Sunrun’s BrightPathTM software uses satellite images and its database of thousands of solar panel designs to find the best fit. Sunrun has developed a network of installation teams consisting of employees and licensed partners, who then visit the home to evaluate the design selection. Only after this step would Sunrun pick the appropriate solar panel, which would generally fit into four distinct types – monocrytalline, polysilicon, thin film silicon, and building integrated photovoltaic panels (BIPV). ""

Combine this with the fact that Sunrun operates in 20 states and has been seeing consistent growth for the past few years, as well as their acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020 means they will do nothing but grow for the next few years.

But I’m buying the hell out of $BB rn. It is by far the lowest risk of the bunch with real fundamentals behind it. That’s why it’s been able to hold the line better than the rest.

This is a legit tech company with some solid patents and breakout potential with big partnerships on the horizon. 

What’s more, $BB has been shorted to hell like all of the rest. The same people who doubled down on their shorts on $AMC and $GME have been hammering down on $BB to spread the risk, except they seriously messed up here as this one actually has sharp teeth.

Short volumes have been lower than the others but still through the roof: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

There won’t be the same level squeeze we saw with $GME but there’s going to be a squeeze.  This is a SAFE $30 stock in the very near future.

Then they wouldn't need to be symbiotic with all the other platforms. They could make revenue with their own hardware.. it could also have netflix app.. netflix+gamestop.

Two days ago the stock was 76 and I set a limit for 1500 (the max it would allow me because of stock price) the limit was accepted and sat until 916 am yesterday when I got an email that was limit was rejected because it was too high.

Now why does this matter? Well look up share hypothecation and what it does. This isn't advice just super shady shit I've been observing and documenting.

"DD on Naked Short Selling, Failure to Deliver, and Short Interest - Who didn’t play by the rules?",20,ldc6gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldc6gm/dd_on_naked_short_selling_failure_to_deliver_and/,1,1612574702.0,"First, some terms (skip if you know them):

#What is naked shorting?

The *illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist. 

[Investopedia on Naked Shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

#What is Failure to Deliver?

Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (e.g. I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)

[Investopedia on failure to deliver ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

#What is Short Interest? 

The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (i.e. returned to the borrower) 

[Investopedia on short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)

#How are these terms related?

While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena, *there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock.
(Source [Predictors of naked short selling](www.aabri.com/manuscripts/121208.pdf)

Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.

#Was there naked short selling with GME?

Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.

[Source for securities threshold list ](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)
[Source for SEC’s regulations](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)

Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales >50% of total sell volume)

[FINRA short volume ](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-index.html)

#What does this all mean?

It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it. 

#Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?

1) Submit a TCR complaint to the SEC [SEC complaint form](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

2) Contact your local, state, and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset.",2021-02-06 03:25:02

This says there are 25.4m shares still shorted

**** IMPORTANT****
Now I have no idea if that includes people shorting the price on the way down from 400 so if it’s mostly those people then this probably  doesn’t mean anything that significant.
***.*******************.

But it it’s the shorts from the original positions the original play was based on, then look at this article from the 1st:
https://imgur.com/gallery/MsXQVz9

27.1m remaining

So according to S3 data who the media are all quoting, people only exited 1.7m of those positions this whole week.

What if maybe they blocked the gamma squeeze from happening that would have occurred if the original viral momentum led to not only a huge pump in price but a punch in the face to the hedge funds who would be forced to exit their positions without a way to stop the price increase by imposing the restrictions, especially with RobinHood because they had a lot of momentum from fractional buyers who threw in $20 for the meme.

https://imgur.com/gallery/GqXJ0vQ

-What if the red circle is when gamma squeeze started due to the viral nature of this cause of easy access to fractional share buying, and then dip after that is when they restricted buying and killed the initial “meme” momentum.

- And what if the two spikes in the green circle are hedge funds dumping the first half of the short positions in two quick but slightly separate dumps, and then other hedgies that knew the play exiting on those highs after buying in on the low points while retail buyers were blocked which started the price drop.

Weekend happens. Cue misinformation campaign on Reddit etc to get people to sell, all the trading activity after most restrictions were lifted (but not all)  was retail buyers selling, nobody huge was making any moves. So it was people being scared by the news and buying silver or whatever.

Elon tweeted about destroying shorts during the days of losses after he came back from a Twitter break but hasn’t done anything to do that just yet for him to claim it.

Mark Cuban is silent on Twitter and he at least usually likes a few posts every day.

Both aren’t indicative of anything at all, it’s just something I noticed btw. I’m hoping that the big whales involved in this (not specifically Cuban or Musk, I don’t even know if they have positions or any actual real interest in this) just waiting to strike, perhaps waiting to see the data on the 9th themselves. Maybe making hedgies think the movement’s died down a bit so they keep restrictions off, cause remember there has still been like 500 share restrictions on GME which was obviously to prevent big whales starting a push again. But this time hopefully they know that the whole world is watching them and any new restrictions they pull or “app freezes / server overloads” they pull will be HIGHLY scrutinized by the public, the government, and many other financial groups. Plus I hope most people got off apps that restricted them last time and onto ones that don’t. We need more fractional share trading apps like RobinHood that have good user interfaces... 

All we need is that same momentum again. That “meme” status. Someone big needs to do something for the lulz (for the cause of course). The hedgies could potentially still be sitting on a large chunk of their initial calls back at like $10 and using this disinformation campaign to try to push the price back to around that area. If people keep selling you’ll let them do that.

Personally, and that means I don’t want anyone  to trade off my advice because I’m not a financial advisor, but I would dream about holding because we need to wait for:

- The short report on Feb 9th for the short data from 1/31 to see if they were telling the truth about their level of short positions.

- The congressional hearings on GameStop with Vlad, DFV, GameStop execs, etc on the 18th

- The results of the SEC investigation.

I’d love to be a shareholder with a potential say in things through all this. And if the price goes close to 0 through all this, that’s fine because I’ll dream about buying more shares over time to bring down my buy in average and then hopefully by 2025 the new execs’ push to pivot to also focusing on e-commerce and esports will pay off and I’ll make some good gains.

But again, I’m not a financial advisor, this is not advice, this is literally all just a shitpost where I’m daydreaming about stuff and writing it on the internet. I love the community that this created, we didn’t want to overthrow democracy, we just wanted to invest in a stock we loved for a company some of us have long term interest in and then also potentially make some short term gains while giving the finger to a cocky hedge fund in the process.

GameStonk Thesis 🚀🚀🌙,19,ldc3co,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldc3co/gamestonk_thesis/,11,1612574467.0,"“💎🙌🏽 GameStonk” Thesis:

    1.    The surge in GameStop pricing was from supply and demand from the sudden viral spread

      -we did not see the sustained and prolonged volume we would need if the shorts were to cover their position, just retail jumping into the hype

      -there is even some evidence (the number of failure to delivers in the data the last several months) to suggest that the surge in pricing was partially hedge funds covering illegal “Naked Shorts” and having to hop into the buying frenzy to cover their ass now that the rest of the situation is being more closely monitored by authorities and that’s a large enough infraction to actually get in trouble but hard to prove if you cover it in time. 

    2.    Hedges set a second round of shorts at higher prices

      -rhe placing of GME on SHO (a watchlist) and NYSE restricting further shorts indicates this

      -this could be an accounting trick to lower there average loss point later, not just out of arrogantly thinking they will discourage people, but it could be realistically be either

    3.    Thursday/Friday we saw a massive amount of Capital being removed from the broader stock market

     -this could have been drawn out by Hedge Funds to pay for cyber disruption campaigns, take care of borrow fees on the outstanding shorts, and fund sustained ‘short ladder attacks’ (things we see happening that artificially push down the price), and eventually to help cover the shorts

    4.    The % shortage of the total stock went down due to market manipulation

       -‘Synthetic longs’ are in essence a fake stock that only exists on the balance sheets, which can be used to give the appearance on financial records of having covered your short position for a fraction of the cash it takes to actually do so, and can be used to spoof SEC data with relatively minor consequences

    5.    There has been a massive cyber disruption campaign

       -400k deepfakes+as many as 10% additional bots, and a hostile takeover of the Subreddit WallstreetBets

    6.    There has been sustained, coordinated low volume attacks to drive down prices

        -AMC and GME stock is directly correlated (an overlayed picture is almost identical)since the supply and demand rocket began last week, indicated coordinated price suppression 

        -Despite this sustained downward pressure, now that retail investors are unrestricted in buying again it seems like redditors with higher psychological buy in and risk tolerance are instead buying more shares and holding the rest with prices holding much steadier even as volume has increased directly coinciding with the reintroduction of Retail investors to the market

    7.    At prices under 100 a share, we LIKE THIS STOCK given the underlying fundamentalist term prospects of the company; /u/DeepFuckingValue’s in depth analysis explaining that position was what started the meme and how they stumbled into realizing the whole “the stock is over 100% shorted” situation

         -Lowering our avg price point to as low as possible beneath that means even if we assume that there is no big squeeze coming and this is just prolonged volatility, we can sell at that price in 6 mo-1 yr to recoup investment which makes continued investment under 100 a logical way to hedge our bets. 

    8.    Even though this is the stock market, behavior economics reminds us that group psychology and the psychology of mass movements is applicable

         -The initial highbrow analysis and memeification spread like wildfire, instilling near cult like influence, while Redditors (used to fighting bot driven influence campaigns) respond with extra intensity if they view their platform as under attack. 

    9.    In 2008 this situation was precedented with VW stocks on the Frankfurt exchange; the main difference is it was organized Hedge Funds involved

       -without anywhere near the capital raised just to spend manipulating the market or as much to lose on the line, 6 trading days of around -50% decline bc of short ladders were still paid for before the shorts were called in

       -the data from VW in 08 also extrapolates over to this scenario as a 28K as max price and 10 K as safe exit point

    10.    I would bet more that I’m right and Wall Street is corrupt and convincing/tricking corporate media into pushing a narrative that benefits them while spreading disinformation online that that hundreds of thousands of people ways better that at this than me (including M. Cuban, Elon Musk,) are wrong; especially when being right means changing my life and my community and being wrong means learning a funny lesson about group think and economic populism. 

Bonus factor that could contribute to a the start of a squeeze: 

Ryan Cohen (the Chewy.com guy who bought 7% of the company and is part of turning it around; the ongoing push to modernize, his presence and a few good recent hires are why we’re long at the stock at 100) has the rights to buy an additional 13% putting his total at 20%.

Answer 3. Gains are gains.

Personally, I don't care what reddit or DFV does. **I do my own due diligence and research, and have decided I like certain stocks.** If my investment strategies mirror or move in tandem with other investors, that is *merely coincidence.* I am not manipulated by any single investors or any collective body of individuals. My research spurces and methodologies are specific to my personal investment strategy but it is, realistically, not the only strategy that can lead to the same conclusion/positions/movements

[Not a lawyer. Not a financial advisor. Not legal advice. Not financial advice]

DFV probably stopped updates for legal reasons; because if the citadel can't kill the ""army"", they go after it's **perceived** leader.

Even if GME is done... there are other shorts to squeeze. If you, *individually,* would like to support under-valued companies.

I just like the stock. Nothing to do with reddit or DFV or whatever esle. I used to get all my games from there when I was younger. I like the core business but I wanted to see some modernization and changes to certain business practices, etc.. they can't do that with no money, so I gave them some. And the board additions announcement looks promising long term for the company, so I'll hold my position; Regardless of any short squeeze or whatever. My only regret is not getting in *years ago* when I first started looking into investing, but 🤷‍♂️.


If you like a company/stock, there's nothing stopping you from investing. [Unless brokers prevent you from spending your ""dollar votes"" on specific companies, for limited time, conveniently as hedge funds are in a known position where more money into those specific companies/stocks is a detriment to their short position.... but I'm sure it's nothing]--

It's s essentially like shark tank. But instead of 1 or 2 investors with millions, you have millions of them with a few dollars.

If enough $1 investors jump in, that can help *any* company move forward with plans to improve, monetize better, or expand.

GME was failing, quite miserably. Then one guy had had faith in the core underlying business. He gave his opinion, and because other people can see/hear/read other people's opinions, they saw/heard/read it. Many (but not all) people came to the same realization after doing their own DD. Millions of people who know nothing about investing but simply liked the stock, and collectively, gave the company the funding they needed to improve upon the core business

On the flip side. Hedge funds did not like the company so they effectively stole money from the company's actual value in order to show their dislike. Unfortunately, a company can't improve or prove it's worth with no money to improve, so they kind of sat in their own mess for a while, until enough people started liking the company enough to give them a dollar or two.

It's not market manipulation for multiple people to like chocolate ice cream. It's certainly not market manipulation to reverse ~~actual~~ *alleged* market manipulation designed to force chocolate ice cream off the shelves.

DFV is under no obligation to 💎👐 to the moon. In fact, *he* is already on the moon. 44mil? That's the moon for him. Seems like the moon for me.

His position or lack thereof has no influence on mine. Because DFV hasn't manipulated me into any position. Period.

If you like the stock, hold it. If you don't like the stock, why are you holding it?

*It's OK to cash out of you've reached* ***your*** *moon.*

But if you're holding out because of DFV, a regular is likely to see that as manipulation. FYI. Thats why my position has nothing to do with DFV.",2021-02-06 03:19:22

In that moment I feel like we was having 1 short for every 4 buy (Or 5 short every 20) and it turned in a few seconds to only 1 every 20 pumping our rocket to orbit again.

After a masive increase in price new retailer with more money started more short positions, that's why you see it going down, currently we are again almost 1 short every 4. They think you will stop holding and they can steal your banana's. You see it down, but it's not us selling, is they starting more and more short's, if you hold/buy they will be forced to close their positions with a buy and increase our banana's. 

If you hold enought until some more people come to GME there will be a masive UP again and short retailers will need to buy again, bringing us to spaceeeeeeeeeeee.

They started naked shorting or just plain shorting with shares borrowed. To create mass panic they raised the price to bring it down with more borrowed shares, however, they didn't account for the retards located her on wallstreetbets. We caught wind of their shenanigans.

They thought WSB was made of 🧻👐, but we are made of carbon 💎👐.

They sold over 100% in short interest, having to also pay a premium. When it was time for the squeeze they put themselves in, they thought it would be best to short >100% so they can at least make some folks realize their gains so the hedges can have more money AND DECREASE THEIR OWN SHORT INTEREST POSITION.

This led to their attempt to psychologically chip away paper hands... Lo and behold, their attempts to drive the price from $500.00 pps, to the $50.00 would allow them to regain the shares they sold short or naked...

So if we hold AND CONTINUE TO HOLD, their psychological attempt to make us sell would actually dig them into a deeper hole.

[The Stockdale Paradox](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/Stockdale-Concept.html) is a story about Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was the highest-ranking United States military officer in the “Hanoi Hilton” prisoner-of-war camp during the height of the Vietnam War.  He was a prisoner for **EIGHT YEARS**!  

Here's an excerpt from the above linked article, but edited for WSB purposes:

`“Who didn’t make it out?”`

`“Oh, that’s easy,” he said. “The optimists.”`

`“The optimists? I don’t understand,” I said, now completely confused, given what he’d said a hundred meters earlier.`

`“The optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by` ~~Christmas~~ `$500.’ And` ~~Christmas~~ `$500 would` (almost) `come, and` ~~Christmas~~ `$500 would go. Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1.’ And` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1 would come, and` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1 would go. And then` \[you get the idea\]`. And they died of` ~~a broken heart~~  `Paper Hands.”`

HODL, my fellow apes!  If you set a time trigger, or if you set a dollar trigger, you're setting yourself up for Paper Hands... and besides, it's more fun to buckle up and watch the fire, isn't it??

A message to all AMC holders

There’s no need to expand in the last couple of days, our precious AMC stocks have been tanking every day, but I’m here to spread a message of calm and prevent burnouts. 
Apart from all the dirty shit they been pulling (I truly believe this ir market manipulation because GME chart looks exactly the same) we have to be calm and trust in AMC here’s why: 
•AMC is actually a good long term investment, they been saved from bankruptcy and now they been opening some movie theaters. 
•with vaccines we can hope as time progresses, restrictions will ease up and cinemas will be attended again.
•right now you might be staring at a 50% or more loss, but be calm, its not irrational to expect the stock to go back to 15-20 at one point in this year.
So we might lose these battle, but the war is not over, there’s no point on selling with a loss, also there’s no point on stressing tf out because this isn’t going the way we expected to, be patient and trust the process, Covid won’t last forever and thanks to us AMC is now healthier than it was.",2021-02-06 03:10:23

CLOV CALLS OUT HINDENBURG ON ITS BULLSHIT,9,ldbt9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldbt9p/clov_calls_out_hindenburg_on_its_bullshit/,10,1612573792.0,"Clover Health calls Hindenburg attack desperate attempt to position itself as a 'white knight'

# Clover Health calls Hindenburg attack desperate attempt to position itself as a 'white knight'

[Clover Health Investments](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/) ([CLOV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV?p=CLOV&.tsrc=fin-srch)) on Friday [responded to ](https://medium.com/clover-off-the-charts/in-response-to-short-seller-firms-questions-47798b0b76da)an [attack from Hindenburg Research ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-shares-tumble-after-short-seller-hindenburg-attack-141549768.html)claiming the tech-focused healthcare company concealed key information from investors, including an active Justice Department investigation. In its response, Clover called Hindenburg’s claims a “desperate attempt for publicity” that disregards the truth.

Hindenburg, which is typically a short seller that bets companies’ stock will go down, said in its report on Thursday that it had no position in Clover, which sells Medicare insurance in mostly low-income areas. Rather, Hindenburg claimed it was issuing the report because it wants the public to know the role short sellers have in “[exposing fraud and corporate malfeasance](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).”

But Clover suggested Hindenburg is merely trying to redeem its reputation in a climate where short sellers are viewed unfavorably. “Given the market’s latest views on short sellers, we believe that Hindenburg, which takes pains to call out their altruism in saying that they are not short on CLOV stock, is foolheartedly seeking to redeem itself by posturing as a white knight of the financial markets,” Clover[ said in its response](https://medium.com/clover-off-the-charts/in-response-to-short-seller-firms-questions-47798b0b76da), which said it had no knowledge of the Hindenburg report before it was made public on Thursday.

According to Hindenburg, a civil investigative demand letter from the Department of Justice shows it’s investigating 12 issues related to Clover, including its software “Clover Assistant,” as well as kickbacks, marketing practices, and undisclosed third-party deals. The investigation, Hindenburg concluded, presents a potential existential risk for a company that derives almost all of its revenue from Medicare.

The Hindenburg report also took aim at the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by Chamath Palihapitiya that took the tech-focused healthcare company public in January.

In its response, Clover acknowledged the Justice Department’s investigation, though said the company’s lawyers as well as outside and third-party lawyers, including IPO underwriter’s counsel, found it wasn’t material and therefore Clover determined it unnecessary to disclose to investors. The subject “received extensive focus and attention,” Clover said, during both its recent IPO and de-SPAC due diligence processes, and noted it had neither received civil investigative demands nor subpoenas.

Clover also responded to Hindenburg’s claims that its relationship with its subsidiary Seek Insurance was “thinly disclosed,” noting that it doesn’t mention the subsidiary on its website yet tells seniors that it will provide them with unbiased information on finding Medicare plans. In its response, Clover described Seek Medicare as a startup separate from Clover, with its own investor, board of directors, management team, and employees.

In response to Hindenburg’s critique over a reported $200 per patient visit fee that Clover pays to physicians who use its Clover Assistant software, Clover said, “To be clear, the ‘extra $200 per visit’ is not incremental or ‘just to use’ the Clover Assistant, but represents the overall payment that covers both the primary care physician (PCPs) office visit and the use of the Clover Assistant. This translates to roughly twice the traditional Medicare fees paid to PCPs for an office visit, more in line with fees paid to specialists.”

Clover said following Hindenburg’s publication on Thursday, it received an inquiry from the SEC, which the healthcare company said it believed was based on the Hindenburg report.

Hindenburg says its report is based on “more than a dozen interviews with former employees, competitors, and industry experts,” along with government reports and insurance filings.

The short seller is known for issuing a scathing report in September calling the electric truck startup Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/)) a fraud, causing that [company’s stock to plummet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-calls-shortseller-report-a-hit-job-shares-still-fall-185403477.html).

While Clover shares tumbled after Thursday’s report, they were up nearly 3% after the market open on Friday.

Bears raise the price, you think the downtrend is over you buy/fomo in. Then they sell at the top to take advantage. And the price drops back down to where it was, or likely even lower.

$90 may have very well been your last chance to get out at a decent price. Some of you might have even bought back in at $70-80 and are already down, you may have been bamboozled.

REASON IM HOLDING 

     First off, sorry for the poor structure I’m on mobile. 
Second disclaimer, I’m an idiot, full blown ape holding onto 1/4 of my hard earned 100% return in 8 long months of investing. 

     I’m going to hold until Cohen takes game stop to the levels we know it can reach. 

     Also because these 💎🤌🏻 won’t let go of this baby rocket, papa Elon hasn’t even installed the electric jets to the rocket yet.

     Think, right now majority of games are sold/downloaded through Microsoft and Sony. Correct me if I’m wrong and there’s actually a 3rd party distributor (other than the publisher of course). 

Now imagine these following possibilities 

1) Downloaded games on hard drives can be saved and redistributed.
                A)You trade in your old Xbox or old play station. You can wipe the hard drives of personal data while saving game data... set new serial numbers to the data so it can be redownloaded and distributed to hard drives for future play/backwards comparability.
               B) this comes with the possibility of game stop exclusive releases of new consoles with pre loaded hard drives that contain used games they’ve purchased off older hard drives. 

2) game stop takes a more aggressive stance on the  competitive game scene with in person tournaments.
                A) possible partnership with twitch/other streaming services. This could happen sooner rather than later because multiple game stop locations could have large tournaments with retail locations around the world.
                B) with possible twitch partnerships this could bring revenue for more twitch steamer merchandise being moved in retail locations. 
 
3) Sec finds shares of GME are in none existence and they fuck us over and claim x amount of “fake” stock will be reclaimed (maybe at face value) from the most recent x purchases.
                A) I’m holding onto what I got until the end, because a funny feeling tells me as this all plays out we might see some wild shit to say the least. 
                B) until everything settles with the suits and the many lawsuits I’ll be holding my shares. Although if it drops below $30 I am eating it up, no crumbs left behind. 

                                       Summary

               I’m in no way a financial advisor, this is not investment advice. I truly like the stock and I believe with the growing possibilities for future e-game distribution and multiple innovative minds at the helm of GameStop, this train can turn around and bring us back to the 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Plenty of people have seen the ridiculous amount of manipulation and FUD going on. Ladder attacks keep driving the price down. How do we know it’s a ladder attack? Look at the volume of trades. Look at the amount of shares being traded one after another. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/real-time

100 shares. 100 shares. 100 shares. One after the other. 

Everyone was all in on the movement. Now you see these posts saying how they were lied to. How they are losing money. First off, you heard it before, YOU DON’T LOSE ANYTHING (or gain anything) UNTIL YOU SELL YOUR POSITIONS. Second, movements and change takes time. Think about how long it took for women’s rights. Gay marriage. You wife to have a bf, and that be ok. This is a revolution! Washington lost more battles than he won, but he won the most important!!!!

People in power don’t like losing. But we can do this. The day will come when the HF need to buy back shares. It costs nothing to hold. It costs money to sell. Will there be some crazy conspiracies? I’m sure there will be. 

If you don’t have any money in savings. You shouldn’t be buying. If you can’t stand volatility. You shouldn’t be buying. If you are easily manipulated. You shouldn’t be buying. 

Now, if you’re asking if it is a good time to buy, read the above. Dig deep and really be honest with yourself. BUT, if you already bought, just HODL!!! 

You are not alone. Deep down, many of us are nervous, but are riding it out anyway. Nobody likes to lose money, but IT TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY!! 

I’ve dropped $15k so far. Plan on another $5k after this post. That’s not much for some, and more than ever seen for others. I’ve done my soul searching and have come to terms with the fact that if I lose it all, I am ok with that.

It’s not about how many shares you have. It’s not about making money. It is all about the point. It’s about beating the HFs at their own game. It’s about writing our names in the history books. I will die on this hill. When historians look back to find out why, they will see these Diamond Fucking Hands clenching my $GME shares. 


Be realistic though. GameStop should not be going bankrupt anytime soon. Look at the moves they are making!!! They just made some huge new hires to propel them forward! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-creates-cto-position-hires-150104792.html

Apple has about one-third of the phone market.  So Apple would only need a 2% share of the mobility market to be the size of their iPhone business.    And we all know that people are going to lining outside those apple stores to get their apple car when it comes out.  I am sure apple will take a huge chunk out of the car market.

And the value of apple will def double.  It is not going to be Kia that will making most of the money.  It is going to be Apple  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

* *Assist Enterprise Architects with the development of application and information roadmaps for achieving the defined future state architecture*

Is it for a quick buck? Well, realize that's probably behind us now. Is it to 'stick it to the man'? The man's making more money off this than you.

I bought into GameStop because of Ryan Cohen. Remember him? He founded Chewy, now a company with a 44 billion market cap. 

Ryan Cohen is creating a leadership to take on the big boys in e-commerce.

And this isn't pet shit. This is video games. The video game market has $$ potential waay beyond what pet supplies do. 

When GameStop has a Merket cap the same as Chewy that's going to be about $900/share!!!!

It could take a year or two. But that is a thousand percent gain over the next couple of years if you hold. 

All this, and the shorts still haven't covered.

I'm relatively new. Joined WSB in August 2020, with my old account which was recently permaband for calling mods homosexuals. (I love you mods)

Anyways, I was excited. Watching all the gain porn made my dick hard and made me think I could one day make a big fat return like the rest of the veteran retards. My mexican ass dreamt about getting some nice USD tendies.  But as you may see, mistakes were made. I trusted Elon to announce a fucking million mile battery or some shit and went all in on TSLA calls for Battery Day (Sept. 22)

[Loss porn aside, those were some good WSB days](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jk31m3/i_was_jacked_to_the_titz_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

After that glorious loss, I took a brake, from September all the way through December. Still with my 99% loss, I didn't give up. My inner degenerate gambler didn't die that day, so I pushed through. I took my weak ass 300 dollar paycheck and put it in Robinhood. I heard some dude talking about having a nice deep fucking value investing opportunity in mind, hypothesizing  about some apparent short squeeze going on with GME, and some new dude that knew a thing or two about e-commerce and dog food. Reading the glorious DD got some light in my smooth brain, and went all in on January OTM calls, because I liked the stock and made my own decision to buy.

They started printing, and I kept buying, like the good retard I am.

&#x200B;

[Needless to say, it went great, and I kept buying calls and shares.](https://preview.redd.it/kyoizxdauof61.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=3435c3e79196d149508ff211b311466d09c8764d)

As you may know, this shit kept going up, and the more it went up, the more calls and shares I bought, until I ended up at this point.

So, staring at my screen at a 50 bagger, September 2020 came into my mind like a war flashback, and guess what I did? I sold. I knew what holding bags felt like, and I promised I would never go through that shit again. If I hadn't sold I'd say that would have been the end of my gambling career, but it went well in the end.

Learning the lesson hurts like a motherfucker, but don't lose hope, as long as we have a market and we have access to options, you'll always have a chance to come back, maybe not with GME, as that was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but a chance will come, and you'll be ready.

Protip For The Newbs Who Bought High But Are Still Staying...,54,ldbgyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldbgyz/protip_for_the_newbs_who_bought_high_but_are/,4,1612572954.0,"[Average Down!](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagedown.asp)

*What is averaging down?*

Example: You buy 10 shares at $350.  It tanks to double digits.  How do you fix this?

**By buying 10 shares at, for example, ~$50 or so.  This is averaging down.  Suddenly, your $350 average cost drops to $200.  With 20 more shares after that at $50 (40 shares total), average cost drops to $125.  (Price doesn't have to be exact but you get the idea).**

**So basically, you're lowering your break-even point by that much, while raising your profit potential with more shares!**

*What's the downside?*

**You're also adding money to this position, so only do this if you're absolutely sure it'll go back up to your break-even point at least.  Don't do this just to chase losses.**

*Why bother with this, considering you're risking even more money?*

Seeing a $350+ average cost while the underlying stays below $100 will most likely fuck with your mind (and that's not factoring in corporate-controlled news trying to manipulate you as well). The more emotional you get, the more likely you'll make mistakes.  It all depends on whether you're willing to throw in some more money to help stick to your convictions and clear your head.  And after spending $3500, what's $500 more to cut your break-even point almost in half?

*How can I avoid getting into this mess in the first place?*

Don't go all-in so soon.  Even only going in half makes a world of difference when you can spend the remaining half buying ~3x more shares at ~1/4 of the price (yes, at this point, you'd be all-in anyway, but at least you'd be doing so at a much lower price).  Just takes a bit of patience.  Either way, sooner or later, you mostly likely will have to hold, which is why mastering this is important.

Not sure why you would put money into something like this you aren’t willing to completely risk to zero. 

The concept is simple, outlast the willingness of the parties with short positions to hold and pay interest on the short position. If you need the money or have a weak stomach then you’re not retarded, you’re a real life idiot. 

If the squeeze is really over then any autist knows that’s fine. It was a calculated risk and any money lost is just going to be written off as a loss to offset gains. If it ends up popping when least expected (that’s when it happens because any large position wouldn’t show you their hand willingly) then that’s why you held and had your limit set.

The reality of GME and shooting up in price,85,ldbdri,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldbdri/the_reality_of_gme_and_shooting_up_in_price/,27,1612572723.0,"If you're looking for it to hit 400+ again by tomorrow, the chances are probably slim. We're getting some positive spikes in price each day which is a good sign that there's enough of us holding ATM, but if we sell out now we lose. ""HOLD THE LINE"" at this point is just a meme that most people are using to drive the price up for small gains, but if we actually buy and hold, maybe in a week's time it'll follow the VW chart and sky rocket. Who knows. We pay a risky game, but it's a lot less risky if you don't half arse it. Don't sell out of fear, sell when you're happy with the price. Buy the dips and fight back against stock shorters when they come back on Monday.

If you want actual serious profit, we need everyone to hold. Half isn't enough to do what we want. As much as Hold the line is a meme, we've actually gotta do it for the long haul.

I didn't want to spend my entire workday just monitoring the stock price, so I wrote a script that alerts me if GME is halted on the NYSE, so I can go and take a look at the takeoff🚀🚀🚀. (not that I would ever sell💎💎👐, I like the stock)

The script checks the NYSE trade halts page (it uses the same API as your web browser would use), and if there is a halt in the matched tickers, it queries the current price from Yahoo Finance (don't murder me for my dirty code, yfinance uses pandas, which I'm not that familiar with)

The instructions are in the script, it works for me on Ubuntu in Python 3.8. If you want it to work on Windows/Mac, or want a different notification mechanism, rewrite the send_notification function.

They already have 5,509 stores that could operate as in person district tournament locations which is a big advantage compared to most leagues that don’t have the resources to lease thousands of locations across the country.  GME could do it for essentially free as they already have the locations and gaming equipment needed in each store. Also, GME now has a meme culture halo thanks to WSB.

Expanding into this arena could generate tons of positive press because it reverses the narrative they are in a growth dilemma. Esports is consistently growing YoY and could be worth tons of money for decades if they can start and then own the dominant esports league.",2021-02-06 02:51:20

Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD,1,ldbb28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldbb28/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad/,11,1612572557.0,"Hello retards.

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robinhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to 10 billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

In fact, nine out of 10 of the world's largest banks utilize BlackBerry's security software. Blackberry also has a robust business segment dedicated to designing self-driving operating systems and vehicle software. As many as 19 out of 25 electric vehicle manufacturers, representing approximately 61% of market share, use BlackBerry's services. Over 175 million vehicles worldwide also have the company's operating software installed.

It should be no surprise that BlackBerry's services have a consumer retention rate of 90%. It brings in about $224 million in revenue per quarter and is breaking even. In its last fiscal year (ended March 30, 2020), the company increased its software sales by 26% compared to fiscal 2019.

The tech firm is well poised to take off, given the current craze for electric vehicles and the need for companies to upgrade their cyber defenses as working online becomes the norm. Since last January, BlackBerry has more than doubled investors' money. It was a temporary target of investor attention last week, along with other much shorted stocks, experiencing a short-sequeeze. However, BlackBerry remains a long term buy due to its outstanding performance in the cybersecurity and vehicle automation fields.""",2021-02-06 02:37:12

Guys hear me the fuck out. Aphria and Tilray are merging to form the *largest cannabis company in the fucking world.* Aphria ($APHA) is buying ($TLRY), but the new company will move under the $TLRY name. I know what you're thinking ""ok. 🦍's like TLRY. 🦍's buy TLRY."" No. 🦍's buy $APHA which is literally a discounted ticket the Tilray show. 

Prices **right now** $16.82 for $APHA and $27.10 for TLRY. after you've locked in a cost basis for **APHA** the price of the stock does not matter. The price of APHA could be $1/share or up to $20/share and it *wouldn't even fucking matter.* All that matters is your cost basis and TLRY price, and heres why. 

Regardless of where APHA is in April/May, your stock after the merger will be .8381 of whatever TLRY is trading at. So you give 2 shits about APHA price, and as long as TLRY stays above your cost basis plus 17% or if it rises to a point where the conversion makes the shares worth less (even if that happened, congrats because we went from ~$17 up to $20-$22 range depending), you're going to profit. Let's look at some numbers. 

10 shares APHA $168.20 

MERGER happens 

10 shares x .8381 (8.3) = $224.93 


This is called arbitrage and it's slipping away right in front of your face. Once APHA rises to TLRY and closes the gap, you lose the opportunity to lock in a low cost basis that will rise by 30+% on merger. 

$APHA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

When I sell an option on Robinhood, am I selling back to the market and thus not retaining any obligation to make good on the contract to the next buyer, or do I retain the obligation should that contract be exercised?

If it's the latter, is there a way to check my obligations somewhere?

They have been working hard on EV Semi Trucks and Autonomous Driving tech and for those that don't know, Paccar is the Fortune 500 parent company of brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt.

So one of the largest (if not largest) semi truck manufacturers in the world ...

It's up to 1% of the ARKK fund now and that's really all the DD I need. Cathie's been buying a stodgy old company that no one cares about? Oh wait, they are actually making autonomous EV semis and have the production capability to do so? Hmm.

How come no one has noticed this?

Do Hedgies really understand the power of weaponized autism?,75,ldaezt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldaezt/do_hedgies_really_understand_the_power_of/,18,1612570157.0,"I don't think they do. Otherwise they'd just surrender the financial battle, stop manipulating the market and cut their losses. Sun Tzu 101: Know yourself, know your enemy. When you are weak, pretend to be strong...when you are strong, pretend to be weak. They failed to grasp *AT LEAST* one of those prerequisite strategic components for victory. I didn't invest more than I could lose. These stonks are just a lottery ticket for me, a keepsake- a mememto. Our diamond-palm deathgrip on these stonks is fueled by unyielding stubbornness and eternal spite. I, for one, intend for my great grandchildren to inherit these shares...

\*autistic screeching noises\*

Edit to add: Even though my health now precludes it, I have been a lifelong student of combat sports (fencing, etc.) Not master, mind you- student. One thing I learned from every sort of conflict that I've been in, including simulated, is the power of calculated spite and apathy. When I see them manipulate, what I feel is *apathy* impelled by a rational and analytical sense of *spite*. Emotion has nothing to do with it. It is a logical position. I don't care what they do, nor will I allow my actions to be affected by their actions. They have no control over me. They have no power over my decisions- nor will they frighten me and make me back away from what I have invested in. It's like they don't exist, but they sorta do.

I'm going to paraphrase/rephrase and possibly misattribute a concept taught by Tsunetomo (*Hagakure*) that explains the power of apathy:

""If a man cannot detach himself from life, he is of no use whatsoever. But through his detachment he can accomplish any feat. If he is able to live  as though his body were already dead, he has gained freedom. Dishonor will never find him; he will fulfill his duty without failing.""

If you have only invested what you can afford to lose, then going forward they are powerless to stop the movement and our collective momentum. Detach yourself from the fear, uncertainty, doubt and desire to check up on them stonks. Whether the stonk goes up or down is irrelevant and inconsequential...for *us*, not for *them*.

People who got left holding the bag with GME should sell and buy AMC,0,ldacxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldacxx/people_who_got_left_holding_the_bag_with_gme/,13,1612570000.0,"While I agree and believe GME shares are not worth more than $20 a share. GME had the fuel to reach $1000-10,000 a share because of the fundamentals of shorting. No sharers available to cover, Thus it was possible to sell your shares at orbital prices. 

Now that WALL STREET was able to play dirty and take the fuel out of GME, I NO LONGER believe GME will reach those prices anymore. NOW the share price will behave like any other normal stock. As GME offers new services and a new business model, then the share price will rise proportionally to the value the company offers. THEREFORE, all those who bought $50-400 a share should sell or recover losses. I SUGGEST selling and jumping onto AMC

I believe AMC will not experience that 🚀🌕 because is not as shorted as GME was. However, the average price as the country opens up should be $15-20 this year specially w vaccines being more effective, allowing you to recover from GME losses. 

Also gives me confidence Blackrock double their ownership on AMC from 3 to 6%. I believe the current price of AMC is a bargain to double your money at this prices. 

As sad as it makes me say it the Short squeeze is over and is GAME OVER for GameStop thanks to WALL STREET MANIPULATION! I feel sorry for those who suffered big losses thanks to the manipulation of Wall Street.

Any reason not to buy options at $0.01 and sell them at $0.02?,15,ldacsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldacsm/any_reason_not_to_buy_options_at_001_and_sell/,21,1612569988.0,"So I recently bought a very low amount of very cheap options not expecting too much (again, I barely put any money into it), and they recently hit $0.01. However, this morning, the stock went up a little bit (still not even close to the call's price target), but the call went up to $0.06, and it got me thinking. Basically is it at all a strategy to buy the lowest strike price $0.01 call, then if the stock goes up a tiny bit it goes up to $0.02 and you sell the option for 100% returns? (I should mention, I have no intent to exercise any of these, I would simply sell them). In addition, the call does appear to be able to be worth less than $0.01, so as long as you don't wait until expiration day, it won't be worthless or anything. Am I truly retarded and completely missed something or is this a valid strategy for stocks I think will be going up?

ALLEGATION: SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL

Let's roleplay, retards. I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.

I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death. Here's my plan.

I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME. This happens. I don't know how, but keep going with me.

So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up. They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one. So how do I never sell one of these? Shorting!

But no no guys... not just regular shorting. We... we would short. EVERY. TRANSACTION. EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY. It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out. Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.

So, we do this for a while. Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go. Well, let's wait and see what happens.

< INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME > [https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png](https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png)

Oh, shit. Things are warming up. People think Gamestop might really come back. If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.

Oh, shit. It happened. A lot. Look at those fail to delivers. They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.

The jig is up.

I don't want to get caught, so I hit my ""omfg algorithm"" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME. I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.

They decided ""FUCK IT"" eventually, and traded in their **FAKE SHARES** for **REAL MONEY** at some point during this, and those are **FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS**. THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS, **SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.**

THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, ""CREATED"" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM. AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION **AND** **~~ITS NOT JUST~~** **MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP. \[Edited, im retarded\]**

===========================================================

please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler

Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio. The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.

[https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe](https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe) Edit: maybe a better explanation? :: [https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc](https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc)

Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open. No pressure, fluid is just movin around. Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life. The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.

Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES. We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down. But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains. Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115. THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT. This was the math all along.

This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.

**TLDR:** The mathematical strategy of the situation is to **reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)**, and **grow the maximum red force (additive).**

We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly. If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE. IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.

Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally - **THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK**, and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT **AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL**

This theory connects the dots.

**Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read. Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything. Anyone with a platform needs to know this. Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.**

EDIT2: omg melvin is so sinister. They knew redditors would bandwagon. They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME. PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.

This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

EDIT:

They also have an email in case you can't call investorrelations@gamestop.com

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

u/Precocious_Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. ""In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!”",2021-02-06 02:03:06

I love what you are doing to the moon! I hope that this community gets even stronger with time. Whatever happens down the road, you truly give me hope for humanity in these bleak days. The rich and powerful will always find fresh ways to rob us, but humour has always been the best weapon against all kinds of oppression.

I know very little about finance and the stock market, so I have been wondering:

If the system is rigged and the machinations inside opaque to outsiders, what chance do even the most insanely reckless excrement-hurling apes of winning?

I guess we could only win if somebody powerful enough needs us to enable even bigger gains for themselves.

So what do you think - are there rich people, companies, or politicians who would profit massively from $GME being catapulted to other celestial bodies by a bunch of groupthinking primates?

If yes, when do you think will they act, and to what end?

At the end, after her transaction was complete, she asked to borrow a pen. When she gave it back to me, wrapped around it was a small sheet of paper with a note with her phone number and saying to call because she’d like to hang out, signed (I shit you not) -Diamond. 

Yes, her actual birth name is Diamond. 

A couple days later we arranged to have our first date tonight, and last night talked on the phone for hours, and it was wonderful...

So it looks like tonight I’ll literally have double Diamond hands 💎🙌🏼💎🙌🏼

🚀🚀🚀🥰🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Tl;dr   I met a girl named Diamond at the game store and tonight will likely have Diamond hands literally and figuratively",2021-02-06 01:57:21

Visit your in-laws and snake their jewelry and power tools and sell it. Use the funds to buy opioids and resell those for cash to invest in GME. Go to several churches on Sunday and take funds from the donation jar. Snake the tips at the local coffee shops. Sell all of your clothes except for a large bath towel you can wear as a tunic. Do you have gold fillings in your teeth? That’s like having a call option in GME. Rip that shit out and head for the “cash for gold” place. Start cruising tinder hard and snake those credit cards when your date is in the restroom. Buy shit on Amazon and claim it didn’t arrive and then sell it. Office buildings nearby? Those are empty.

So hey, I'm new (Not new to reddit, but I've been lurking in the shadows for a while now at WSB). First of all **💎💎🙌🙌🚀🚀. I'm only in for 2.2 of GME and 7 AMC because I arrived late at the party, and I will be holding until they pry them from my cold dead hands.**

Moving on though...

The SEC and a LOT of lawyers right now are watching us. They are looking at you bunch of retards and trying like hell to find ways to justify how 1.) January 28th and RH blocking trading didn't actually mean that a shit ton of folks lost money. They're combing through these pages trying to figure out within a reasonable doubt how many of us would have purchased and how MUCH money their move legitimately cost us, but more importantly 2.) EVEN IF they prove that they fucked us over, they are going to look for justification about why ""it wasn't that bad"" and that those of us who lost money lost money because we ""mob mentalitied (It's a word I made up, fuck you I'm a monkey), and that this was protecting us from ourselves. They're gonna pin this all on DFV if they can, painting us as lemmings and he like some red bandanad (fuck you, these are words) Pied Piper who just led a bunch of newbs to buy a stock because we're braindead halfwit morons (I mean, I am, but no less so than any of the regulatory agents trawling this sub right now).

They're going to look at all of these posts and look at all the people crying who are screaming about their life savings (which, wtf guys, what are you doing? No one said to do that, we're monkeys who don't give financial advice. Who are you listening to? Was it the hype? Was it the fact that it made CNBC? Who said to do that? Because it sure as shit wasn't the dumbasses here.) They're gonna pick and choose the statements made. They're going to pull out lines that demonize the mods/dfv/line holders as best they can, trying to paint us as a malicious activist group instead of just being people who like the stocks.

Anyway... the point is this: Recognize that if you're going to post you need to be aware that right now people with advanced degrees are writing a narrative that paints us in one way or another. Here's where we get to control it. We aren't some malicious mob and we weren't fucking coerced. We bet. There was a theory based on public information, we aggregated that public information and we BET (like the name). Bets can lose. Hell, odds are generally not in the favor of the person placing them most of the time. We played the stock market because we could. We continue to play the stock market because we can. This is how the stock market works. #sorrynotsorrymelvin

They're gonna look at these posts that you guys are crying that you bought in at 10k at 419 ( **💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀** ) and say some shit that because they are smart lawyers or some shit that they need to protect us from ourselves so doing some kind of BS regulatory nonsense that will strip us even more of our trading ability or will somehow protect hedge funds from having to pay what they have committed to pay because a bunch of dumb internet apes drove up the price. They'll say it's to ""protect us"". So, here's the thing: Act like some goddamn adults, okay?

Yes, it sucks, the stock market has sort of ALWAYS sucked for the little guy. That's really the point. It hasn't historically worked for the little guy and right now based on what we do RIGHT NOW it will fuck over the little guy down the road or it will give us more freedom.

So do what you will WSB, but do it with the knowledge that we get to choose this narrative. We get to let those lawyers and interns and public officials know that we are not some fucking children who don't know what we're doing (No, we're retards and apes, goddammit, and to be fair, we know just as much as these hedge funds when we put our dumb heads together).

They're going to paint us as fools to be ridiculed and pitied because we bought high and our portfolios are as red as the lipstick that I hope the SEC leaves behind when they kiss my ass. So do us a favor and change the narrative. Stop giving these halfwits justification for clamping down on us because of these boneheaded moves you made.

Yeah, You better believe I lost money but you wanna know WHY i'm okay with having lost it? Because fuck you, that's why. Because it's my money and I can do what I want with it. I invested it, I placed a bet, and I haven't cashed out so it's a Schrodinger's cat situation right now.

They're gonna look to pin this shit on him. If you read the news (Which, tbh, you shouldn't because holy shit), but right now they're positioning themselves to demonize him and make him the face of this whole thing. You're gonna have your grandma's and mom's asking you about who ""this Kieth Gill is"" and why he's a cult leader. Just keep that in mind.

So, hey SEC, want to know why I bought? Because I was around for the 2008 crash where a lot of really important people made a lot of really stupid fucking plays that crashed the economy. I have spent the last year paying close fucking attention to the pandemic profiteers and have seen how money has bled out one day after another from small businesses and people who don't have jobs or health insurance, or who are dying in fucking nursing homes that is bleeding their retirement and savings dry so that they can't leave money to their children for intergenerational wealth transfer.  
So yeah, this stock, I like. This stock was a stock that I wanted to buy. I wanted to buy it because for one blissful moment it felt like there was some level of control that could be wrested away from these leviathans of the financial world playing games on the losses of companies and individuals.

Instead of small intimate ""meeting of the mind"" dinners where those responsible for billions just ""have a chat"" we talked as a group. Fuck you for making Kieth Gill your fall guy, and fuck you for what you're about to try and say about the group here.",2021-02-06 01:52:18

the math is on our side, nothing illegal is going on.

  
GME is still somewhat around 120% shorted,   
there are enough mad lads in here holding for dear life because at this point with the current loss makes no sense trying to save the last 10 bucks.  
There ain't physically (digitally maybe) enough shares for the hedgies to cover

All we have to do is HOLD and the climb up is pretty much guaranteed because of math ffs.  
The only catch is we have to have the numbers and given the recent crash, there's no doubt a lot of ""comrades"" have fled 

Everyone knew from the get-go that some scummy tactics were going to take place at some point because fuck you the law applies differently to different classes (welcome to reality bitch)  
Yet I keep on seeing lots of posts of people basically saying time to give up is over etc.

What I think we're lacking is a proper ""promo campaign""  
All the billboards are a great start, when the price was up to 350-400 it was mainly due to all the coverage this whole thing was getting.  
Now that the hype has died down, it would need to be revived  
Now more than ever is easy to get in with the current price per share of 60-50 bucks.  
It's not even market manipulation because you just have to show the truth of the situation and expose the lies.

Hypothetically, those who drop some big bucks on GME should consider using some % of that budget towards ads, influencers, and whatnot  
Remember the whole ""Subscribe to Pewdipie VS T-Series movement"" yea we need the same shit

You need to play the same game (no pun intended) that hedgies are playing.

You can literally just reframe the whole thing as it was WSB plan all along for this crash to happen to ppl can double down the investment at a much cheaper price.

LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Hedge funds with bearish positions on GameStop, the video game retailer at the centre of the recent retail trading frenzy, made $3.6 billion in profits this week as the share price dropped sharply, financial analytics firm Ortex said on Friday.

That comes after short positions on GameStop suffered cumulative losses of $12.5 billion over January as a horde of small-time investors piled into the stock, inflating its price as much as 2,400% and forcing many hedge funds to buy them back to cover losses.

But the short squeeze has since ebbed, pushing GameStop shares 90% below last week's peak of $483.

Ortex data also showed hedge funds' profits from shorting AMC , another company targeted by retail investors, amounted to $430 million this week as of Thursday close.

In Europe, short sellers of Nokia stock made $126 million, the data showed.

Avoiding Foreign Currency Conversion Charges (Canadians),6,ld9ugk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld9ugk/avoiding_foreign_currency_conversion_charges/,11,1612568603.0,"Made a post about this yesterday re: what TD and other banks are charging every time you buy US securities with CAD, whether this is from a Margin, TFSA or RSP account. There is conflicting information on their website, as one commenter pointed out, it says a range between 3-3.5%. 

&#x200B;

It's actually only the spread on foreign currency, which changes every day and it depends on how much you're converting. For example, its about 1% for $30,000-44,000. On top of this, the $9.99 commission is charged in the currency of the equity you are purchasing (e.g. $10 USD for buying a US security).

Solution:

This part is based on TD Web Broker, but should work for other banks. Good new is, you can get around this by transferring you funds to a US RSP or TFSA account, which won't trigger penalties, as they are more or less than same account, only separated in your brokerage web page for visual clarity. You have two options for transfer: either go to Accounts and select 'Cash Transfers and Foreign Exchange' if its sitting in cash or 'Securities Transfer' if you have it tied up in US stocks. You can also call their Web Broker line, like I did, if the button isn't working. TD said it would take one business day for RSP and two days for TFSA to transfer. If you call and have them do it 'back of house, (e.g. calling) you need to remove any pending orders, possibly also stop losses, or they may not start the transfer, as they will wait until orders are settled. In which case, it may be safer just to sell and transfer when you have the cash.

&#x200B;

Once it's in the proper account (US TFSA) you will no longer be penalized for currency conversion, until you take the money out in CAD or purchase CAD stocks (or any non-USD listed security). Only cost should be the $9.99 US commission on each trade, which is lowered after you hit a higher threshold of trades, per quarter.

&#x200B;

Hope that helps.

So decided to showcase a few things and kinda breakdown some strategy and why I am going very bullish on the U.S. market.

Everybody is under the crunch currently due to COVID. Companies are releasing abysmal earnings reports and that has caused losses all around. So the market this pass week has been a bit of a roller coaster because of the above issue.  Then this morning the Market shot up during opening hours. Why is that? Well the answer lies here in this news story. https://www.npr.org/2021/02/05/964365980/senate-passes-budget-resolution-vice-president-harris-breaks-tie

Now I don't care about the political implications of this. I only care about the Market effect. For those of you who don't know, Dems have rolled their stimulas plan that would give another 1400 bucks to Americans into what is known as a Reconciliation bill. Reconciliation bills are 1. Filibuster-proof and 2. Just require a majority vote. It's next stop is the house but just the IDEA that it's just one step away has launched some gains in this mornings trading session. 

The truth of the matter is, you buy for the future-regardless of what you are buying.

Keeping in mind that you buy for the future (doesn't matter if you take a bullish or bearish position). You need to see what is going on and what is being discussed.

I will lay out my strategy concerning XOM.

The Reconciliation bill was being talked about for the past week (Again, don't care about the political implications. If you do, suck a dick. Here to make money). Dems have recently taken control of the Senate since passing the power-sharing agreement. Biden is still in his first 100 days and they are going to want to put a jewel in his crown. Dems called for a late night session to vote on 11 amendments for the Reconciliation bill and it passed. During the same time, OPEC (a bunch of oil countries who pretty much control the market) had their ministerial meeting and kept their targets for Oil production (they cut heavily) and have also announced that oil levels are now at a draw (more oil going out than coming in https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/opec-signals-it-s-on-track-with-goal-to-drain-oil-inventories). We also got hit with jobless claims numbers and they were below expectations.

If I was a betting man (I am) I would put a bullish bet that Oil will be going up. Why? Due to the huge push of the Reconciliation bill, Oil now being at a draw, and less people that are unemployed. We can assume that there will be a huge demand for Gasoline with a potential that gas companies will be able to set the price that they want pretty much. 

Now for the retail sector. More money in people's pockets means more shit they are going to buy.  Just remove the bit about OPEC.

I put a bullish bet on XOM going up with 35c call @ 48 3/5.

Encouragement for WallStreetBets with the #SnyderCut example,10,ld9s01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld9s01/encouragement_for_wallstreetbets_with_the/,0,1612568414.0,"I would like you to remember this while I hold my stocks with firm grasp and diamond hands.

Media and big companies have always, **always**, tried to tell us, the common people, what we should know or not. They have always tried to make us think it doesn't matter whatever they may be right or not, but to make us **fear** that no matter what, we will pay the consequences.

And I'm here right now to recall that they are NOT always the winner with a recent example. I know this looks like a big strech, but hear me out.

For years they constatly told us (comic-fans like me) that the famous **Justice League Snyder Cut** did not exist. And they came from all angles and purposes, to make us believe it could not happen, even if it really existed.

But nontheless, we fans endured. We take the bet and double down, we speak our voices and we prove them wrong.

Not only the Snyder Cut existed, even when the so called ""experts"" told us it was a myth and imposible, but next month it is gonna be released online worldwide. So to those all-knowing experts that keep telling us this is lost, and that we don't know about it, and that we should sell and take the losses... SHUT THE FUCK UP.

It doesn't matter if you, subreddit ape, like or not the Snyder style, cult, fandom or whatever.

What matters is that it existed and proved them wrong.

What matters is that strengh in numbers and holding the line was the right call.

As it is now.

So be strong and hold.

TL;DR: If we hold, we can win again, as we already did as a group when pressing for the SnyderCut",2021-02-06 01:40:14

So if you have to *look over your budget and spend time thinking if you can afford a meme stock.* Do yourself a favor and make sure you have **plenty of wiggle room** before you invest SERIOUS (relative to your income/savings) money!

They're literally building a 4g network on the moon.

I know the stock has been stagnant for the last decade with little blips here and there, but the more I dig into Nokia, the more I can see them being a power player in the coming years.

I know people say they've been burned on NOK in the past, but I think they're future is looking bright.

I'll probably lose on this, but they're literally going to the moon one way or another, and that's good enough for me.

My friends and I are working on a fledgling school project turned business venture in which we hope to provide factually purely data driven updates on all media posts (not just the Reddit’s but the big companies too) pertaining to stocks at a low cost to retail investors ($1 a month for students, $4.20 for everyone else) we are really just getting setup but our earlier data possibly contradicts several major articles. We have simply started the process of giving the reporter the data. 

Anyways I will post an update if you guys want once we are ready. 
In addition as some analysts have claimed, these social media trends are dangerous, well we also hope to protect retail investor by using again data driven exclusively, fundamental scores, so retail investors don’t need to spend hours browsing Reddit’s and reading potentially biased dd, though your own investigation is still recommended as we just provide end recap data. 

We are just setting up a discord and our website. I will post links hopefully by the end of the week if mods allow. 

If you have interest in this idea please let me know or if you have concerns. I am genuinely trying to build a company for the consumer not the hedge funds and have seen some much misinformation today, data is the only solution. 

The idea is called Modern Media Business systems or MMBS :) 

Thanks everyone!

P.S our current internal name for the bot that pulls data is A.U.T.I.S.T as a node to all of you, and myself, who in fact has autism, though mine is minor compared to the severe disability some suffer from.

Bull Thesis for Boeing ($BA),27,ld9mgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld9mgr/bull_thesis_for_boeing_ba/,33,1612567987.0,"TLDR: I like the stock

Boeing has had a rough couple of years. In 2019 the 737 MAX was grounded and in 2020 the pandemic saw a massive slowdown in revenue for Boeing. The stock went from $446 to about $350 when the 737 was grounded, to a low of $89 in March because of the pandemic, and is now trading at around $210.

As the vaccine rolls out, and the 737 being approved for service, I think Boeing is one of the last great covid recovery plays and I think we will definitely see a reversal of their fortune in the long term, with great short term potential as well.

Operating as a duopoly with Airbus, Boeing has an exemplary economic moat and has years of backlog that will provide some good revenue. They have a history of providing military aircraft to the US and abroad. They are not going anywhere, regardless of the potential dropoff in civilian air traffic.

They've found strong support at this current level, and I think this is the start of the climb back to their pre covid/pre 737 price. Wouldn't be surprised if it is flirting with $500-600 in the next couple of years.

Fellow apes,
I believe we are in a very interesting position right now, and we still face the very real possibility of seeing a massive short squeeze on GME. Full disclosure: 11 shares @ $180 average, I am poor college ape. This is also not financial advice, I am dumb ape.
This is going to be a long post. I know you apes hate reading, but I think this post is going to contain some very helpful and reassuring information for many of us, and I encourage all ape to try their best to read. TLDR at bottom for silly monke.
Let's take a moment to consider where we are with respect to GME, and rethink all the events that have just unfolded over the last few weeks. Starting early January, we saw the price of GME hovering just below the $20 mark. GME had been floating around the $10 - $20 range since about mid October. As GME started to increase in popularity on WSB, due to rumors around Ryan Cohen's interest in the company, the price continued to increase. During this time, short sellers began rapidly opening positions because they believed GameStop was headed to bankruptcy due to the shift away from physical retail stores, and because they were betting the hype around GME would eventually die off and the share price would fall. On January 11th, Ryan Cohen gained a seat on the board, held a 13% stake in the company, and the share price jumped almost 20% to $20.65. This is an important date and an important price in our story. The January 15th official short interest report stated 61,780,000 shares had been sold short. On the 15th, the share price was about $35. This is a crucial piece of information to consider. Short Interest is reported twice monthly, so the last report before January 15th was from December 31st, and the next report won't be issued until February 9th. The next report will show short interest up to January 29th. Keep that in mind, I'll come back to this point later.
Back to the January 15th report. 61.78 million shares had been shorted at prices less than $35. Every single short of those 61.78 million was betting the price would be less than $35, and it's more likely that most were shorted around the $15 - $20 mark. I don't have exact numbers, but for the sake of simplicity and also conservatism, I am going to assume these 61.78 million shorts were for $30. These shorts would only make profit if the price was to go below $30. For ape who STILL doesn't understand what shorting a stock is, please read this. On January 15th, at least 130% of the float had been sold short. Yes this is possible, and does not necessarily indicate wrong doing by hedge funds or market makers. The January 15th report serves as one of the main catalysts for the giant price leap from $35 to $483. The report was released on January 27th, and the share price hit $375 the same day, followed by a peak at $483 on the 28th. Since then, the price has decreased all the way back down to $65 at the time of writing.
This is where we get into the main point of my thesis, and why I believe we should not be worried about this massive drop in price. My argument: MOST short positions from the January 15th report have NOT covered yet. Why would they have? What we saw from January 11th to 28th was a run up fueled entirely by hype and a couple of gamma squeezes. The short squeeze did NOT happen. But it will. Hedges are still better off paying their interest payments on their short positions than covering millions of shares for prices over $300.
The hedge funds and other players were able to drive the price down from $483 to $65 in less than a week. Regardless of the illegal actions they took to make this happen, it is still the reality we face. Their biggest win was hitting a big stop-loss raid when the price went down to $250. The price was forced down not just because of ""short laddering"", but because they were able to hit psychological prices were many holders had set stop losses. $250 stop losses dropped down to $225, which dropped down to $200, etc. Shares were sold at these prices, not to the shorts looking to cover, but to other retail investors and some institutions hoping for the eventual short squeeze.
The hedge funds knew they would be able to do this. It didn't even take that long. In 6 days they had brought the price down over $400. So why in the world would they have covered even a single share above $100?? Answer: they didn't. They are waiting to bring the price down to an acceptable level, buying far OTM calls, and letting",2021-02-06 01:32:28

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

&#x200B;

Hello,

&#x200B;

My name is \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ and I currently own \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

I've been around here off and on again for a few years. This is the first time I jumped in on something, and I did it because win or lose, I wanted to be on the team, playing the game.

I'm considering starting up an investing club. While I've been doing this for a little while (about three years), I'm still really green and have a lot to learn.

The other thing I've learned is that with the tools at our disposal, it's really become possible for us little guys to stand up to the evil Oligarchs. To some degree, we can play ball with them. I only see this becoming more feasible as the years progress.

Would there be any interest in starting a trad investing club? We would primarily look for gains from companies who aren't bastards. Screw Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and all the other companies with dirty agendas.

What if we worked together to strengthen companies with values that protect us and empower us? 

I started investing in Tesla when Musk said he was leaving California because of the restrictions, when he said that he was opening his factory against orders to shut down and that he would be on the floor with his people.

I respect that. That's a leader I can get behind.

I'm kind of just gushing here, but I wanted to know if there any like minded investors who would want to team up and share information.

Also, I just wanted to say how much I love you guys and how much it's been a pleasure playing the game with you. Here's to getting more tendies. Bears are gay.

**Due Diligence**

Nokia  is no longer the company your dad or grandpa remember it as. To  understand the value behind Nokia you have to understand 5G and what it  means in terms of the 4th Industrial Revolution. In my opinion, Nokia is  extremely undervalued at $4.50 as it is trading at 1x revenue and its  place in the global 5G infrastructure is not being adequately  represented at its current valuation. 

I  will be doing a deep dive into 5G and what it means for the post-COVID  economy, how Nokia fits into Cathie Wood’s investment philosophy, Nokia  financial overview and some technical analysis.

Many  of you will assume that 5G is mainly for smartphones. That is not the  case. 5G is the most important telecommunication upgrade cycle since  cell phones first came out. Why you may ask, that is because of  advancement in robotics, autonomous driving/MaaS (Mobility as a Service)  and Internet of Things. Each industry segment mentioned has the  potential of becoming a $300 billion sector. 

**Robotics**

Have  you seen the new Boston Dynamic bots, those things are agile, smart and  completely human like in their mobility. They are sturdy and built like  tanks. Why does robotics matter well that is because high tech is  coming after every “dumb job” that is out there. Notice how Amazon,  Costco and Wal-Mart use robots in their warehouses and fulfillment  centres. Modern robots will require extremely low latency when  communicating with its handler/command center. That is where 5G comes  into play. To get extremely low latency you require a sprawl of 5G  equipment meters away from each other. This adds more demand for  equipment compared to LTE as their frequencies are able to travel  farther than 5G frequencies. Robots will be used for security  surveillance, construction, healthcare, manufacturing and in the  services sector. Out of the previously mentioned sectors, healthcare is  the largest and most lucrative. Robots will be used as the interface to  perform diagnosis of patients (TeleDoc anyone?), making it possible for  highly qualified doctors to serve remote communities. Furthermore,  robotics will be used for remote surgeries and the last thing I want is  lag when I am being stitched up.

**Autonomous Driving**

This  is where 5G comes to life. Apple partnering with Hyundai and focusing  on self-driving technology is huge news in tech. According to CNBC  Hyundai’s main focus for the future is Mobility as a Service. To get to  that vision of full autonomous driving you require cars to communicate  with each other with low latency. That is where 5G comes into play.  There are two wireless standards for this tech Wi--Fi and 5G cellular.  China has made 5G the standard but the American Federal Government has  told the industry to make the decision for themselves. The American  Automotive Association is advocating for the cellular standard due to  security and advanced technology. Ford has gone through and made 5G  cellular their standard. GM is the only one that is choosing Wi--Fi. 

To  bring autonomous driving to life we require an intricate 5G  infrastructure in cities and interstate highways to get full autonomous  driving. We are getting there sooner than later due to Tesla’s  incredible machine learning algorithms and all the data that every Tesla  car collects. 5G will add another layer of security which will allow  regulators and law-makers to give the go-ahead.

**Internet of Things**

This  is the coolest part of 5G as everything will be smart. From street  lamps to gas/electric meters to farming equipment. IoT combined with Big  Data will allow our economy to become highly efficient. 

Here are a couple links to how this all plays out using 5G:

# Nokia & Cathie Wood’s Investment Philosophy

 Link is broken down due to AutoMod         https:// youtu  .be   /XaUYx4iU\_hk

According  to Cathie Wood, during a great economic disruption that is when  innovation takes off and experiences exponential growth. She states that  during the tech bubble that is when the seeds for the 4th Industrial  Revolution were planted. Just notice Nokia’s stock price during that  time. We needed 10-15 years for cost to come down to allow for these  innovations to take off. 

Nokia is  at the center of all these innovations because of their role as a  network infrastructure equipment manufacturer. And, currently it is  being treated as having similar valuation as Dollarma ($TSX) which is a  retail chain of dollar stores.

Are the market makers playing a game with us, basically restricting options trading only to people that can afford $3,000+ per contract, even on ones that expire same month?

ALLEGATION: SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL

Let's roleplay, retards. I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.

I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death. Here's my plan.

I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME. This happens. I don't know how, but keep going with me.

So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up. They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one. So how do I never sell one of these? Shorting!

But no no guys... not just regular shorting. We... we would short. EVERY. TRANSACTION. EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY. It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out. Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.

So, we do this for a while. Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go. Well, let's wait and see what happens.

< INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME > [https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png](https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png)

Oh, shit. Things are warming up. People think Gamestop might really come back. If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.

Oh, shit. It happened. A lot. Look at those fail to delivers. They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.

The jig is up.

I don't want to get caught, so I hit my ""omfg algorithm"" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME. I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.

They decided ""FUCK IT"" eventually, and traded in their **FAKE SHARES** for **REAL MONEY** at some point during this, and those are **FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS**. THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS, **SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.**

THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, ""CREATED"" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM. AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION **AND** **~~ITS NOT JUST~~** **MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP. \[Edited, im retarded\]**

===========================================================

please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler

Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio. The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.

[https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe](https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe) Edit: maybe a better explanation? :: [https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc](https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc)

Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open. No pressure, fluid is just movin around. Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life. The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.

Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES. We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down. But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains. Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115. THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT. This was the math all along.

This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.

**TLDR:** The mathematical strategy of the situation is to **reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)**, and **grow the maximum red force (additive).**

We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly. If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE. IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.

Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally - **THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK**, and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT **AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL**

This theory connects the dots.

**Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read. Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything. Anyone with a platform needs to know this. Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.**

EDIT2: omg melvin is so sinister. They knew redditors would bandwagon. They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME. PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.

I know going full apeshit is really tempting, but hear me out.

GME is literally skyrocketing out of our screens into our hearts, but don't get swooned by this. The market is EXTREMELY volatile, and this goes *both ways*. 

Don't go apeshit and throw your life savings into GME, it may very well drop as hard as it increased within seconds. Hold what you have, buy what you can afford to lose. We'll get there, but it's still the long run and we have to stay steady.

I love you all, stay safe, keep those diamond hands steady. Don't go apeshit, trust in your fellow retard.

Edit: Also, I genuinely believe we will make it, but there's still a small chance the hedge funds will prevail and we won't get a second squeeze. Even if we don't win right now, hold onto your stocks. GameStop is going through a huge transformation right now, and I genuinely believe the stock will increase in worth over the years. Playing the long run doesn't cost you anything extra, and I genuinely believe that when I pass my stocks to my grandchildren, they will be rich assholes and spend all the GME money on some good games.",2021-02-06 01:20:16

Should you buy it? 
I don't know, do you want to and can you afford to?

Most of these questions posted have simple answers, that if you're wondering these things, you can literally give yourself the answer. Decide if you can financially afford it, don't invest what you can't lose. Easy.

Do you hold? Yes retard. 🦍
Obviously. Who the fuck buys a stock to sell at a loss? It seems pretty unlikely that a stock NEVER goes back up again. Chances are, it goes back up. 🚀
Do we know when? No, because we're not fucking fortune tellers.

COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR: A CHANCE TO ADDRESS AND AMEND,4,ldj9za,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldj9za/counterproductive_behaviour_a_chance_to_address/,9,1612593445.0,"Hi lads, just wanted to air something bout here. 

This isn't a post about numbers and patterns and trades as such. In my opinion, when you're up against a behemoth like major hedgefunds, it's essential that we don't all stray and move apart like lost lambs. Our strength here comes from more than just the size of your portfolio, it's supposed to be a community. 

The last 2 weeks, this place has been toxic. We've slated one another (I'm as guilty as the next man) been unsupportive of those who came out unscathed from these incredibly volitile movement's in the market, and just generally been dickheads to one another. 

This goes against where our strengths are. It's counter productive. 

We need to step up and instead of acting like  bunch of individuals, start acting as a single entity again. 

People have been attracted to these shares because of the obvious strength we have in numbers but everytime we shit on somebody when they share a different opinion to us, it brings us all down. If we can't have anything somewhat decent to say, just be civil back. 

We spread by word of mouth, people invest because their friends invested because one person found the shares on WSB of Interest. Right now, we're apes just throwing shit at each other and it's starting to show. 

I invested in AMC, friends invested in GME. Others invested elsewhere. We're already spread thinner than we should be. Can we just be something a little bit more than self riotous cunts for a week to see where this can actually go. 

We've been told countless times that holding is key. But for those of us holding, you don't have to a dick when someone decides to get out. 

I still believe that as a collective we have so much potential but only as a group, not shit slinging individual apes.",2021-02-06 08:37:25

Regardless Ramen and McDoubles are on the Menu. I'm what you call a giant pussy >60% of my portfolio is in VOO, SPY, and VT. After doing Due Diligence on the 140% Shorts. Sold all my positions to go all in $GME. The strategy made so much sense and with the whole world backing $GME it seemed like a once in a lifetime event. My Eminem 8 Mile moment.  That's why I went all in on $GME, because this was not a pump and dump their was real analysis backing it.

Do I feel defeated? Yes I do and I'm still not selling. Do I care about the money I lost?  NO, I'd rather take the risk than buy a car or a few vacations. To me Finance is more than a hobby; it's my passion. I learn something new every single day from technical analysis & strategy to psychology & group think. Don't listen to r/invest, There is no wrong way to invest it's just how much risk/reward are you willing to endure.  I'm not worried about having substantial money when I'm old since my wife's pussy will be super dry/loose, my wife's boyfriend will be too old to get his dick up, and I'll barely be mobile enough to do dope shit (like watch my wife's boyfriend fuck my wife and ride my bicycle). I'm not worried about retiring rich and I just pray god allows me to be healthy enough at 80 years old so I can work at a WalMart. Where my fellow employees try to avoid me because I'll talk their ear off about my current investment strategies. They'll feel stuck and feel obliged to listen to my autistic rants about Market Cap, because I'm senile. That's the real American Dream. 

I am content no matter what my bank account looks like. I don't partake in Finance solely to make money; I do it for the Tendies and the YOLO.  YOLO my fellow Autist. Really embrace the YOLO lifestyle, because You Only Live Once. Love You all and I thank the DD I've gotten from this community.

1.) We are going to know the short interest on Tuesday and I believe that it went up exponentially considering we still haven't squeezed.

2.) The media just days ago said that we were ""all in"" on silver which is owned by Melvin and his whores. The news was literally geared against us and lied about the direction of the subreddit intentionally.

3.) The entire sub was sure that the squeeze hadn't happened until we got warnings from previous mods here that the sub was going to be monetized and that our reliable mod team up until that point was now being replaced.

4.) Robinhood literally did straight up illegal shit  and manipulated the market so that people couldn't buy for days. Robinhood is going to lose a metric shit ton of money for this move and wouldn't have done it unless Melvin was completely fucked.

5.)    *Gabriel* Plotkin's (founder of Melvin Capital) wife literally filed for divorce from this motherfucker just days ago as he was getting his asshole collectively gaped by us apes. Shits personal now dude will do whatever he has to do to fuck us (I would) he lost a FORTUNE.

6.) We have post confirming that there are fresh account bots manipulating our opinion on here and trying to get us to sell and waiver (its working).

7.) Financial institutions have been confirmed to be jacked to the tits in GME 800c 3/19 calls. These motherfuckers know what they are doing.

8.) Apes together strong and suddenly we're all paper handed bitches? I don't buy it.

9.) The chart similarities between GME and other BANG stocks are uncanny and show clear manipulation.

10.) MOST IMPORTANTLY Janet Yellen told me the squeeze was happening next week, jerked me off yesterday, and kissed the tip.

HOLD THE LINE YOU APES THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. I like the fucking stonk love this community and this is just my opinion except for the part about Janet giving me sloppy toppy and jerking me off chimp style with her feet. Any more reasons you guys can think of why its still a good idea to invest?

Everyone needs to email GameStop and ask for an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split

[investorrelations@gamestop.com](mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com)This is the investor relations email for GameStop, email them telling them your full name, the country you're based in, and the number of shares you own and request an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split. An Emergency Shareholder Vote would mean eliminating all synthetic stock and taking leverage away from short-sales and a Reverse Stock Split would cause Citadel and any other phantom shares creators to be stuck holding their losses on their shorts position. This is the quickest way to help end this situation once and for all.

You can do this using the template below created by u/Whiplash51

Subject : Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is ----- -----, I am located in ----- and I currently own ----- shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

(your name)

&#x200B;

Full disclosure, I didn't come up with this idea, credit goes to both u/gnadami and u/Precocious_Kid for it, I'm just reposting with a template to help spread awareness about this and get more people in on it.

EDIT: I've updated the post to include the template created by u/Whiplash51 since I think it sounds a lot more professional, additionally, u/canadian-brasilian suggests that we contact the largest shareholder of the company to ask them to call back all the short stocks. The largest shareholder is Fidelity Investments and you can contact them via their form linked below:

[https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/contactus](https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/contactus)

And for anyone wondering what the logic behind all this is, here's an article courtesy of u/johnjacobbtc explaining naked shorts, how they can be manipulated, and how a reverse split stock can help solve this issue.

2: Double the fuck down.

Closing a position basically means closing the circuit on whatever type of transaction you're making with a brokerage with its' opposite.

Most commonly:

1. Selling if you bought a stock.
2. Buying back a stock if you short sold.
3. Cancelling an order that you placed with limits.

TL;DR: You'll always have an open position until you sell your st💎nk(s). This is nothing to fear and is perfectly normal. Once you've bought (with a cash account), you're fine. Margin is a whole 'nother animal. Stick to a cash account, trust me.

So we fell back to trading on a combination of actual company potential VS ""What IS the right value?"" rather than ONLY squeeze speculation.  This is great for us.  GME was never a bad LONG TERM PLAY.  It was an INVESTMENT rather than just a PLAY or a spec.

The movement up today indicates to me a longer term sentiment with a SQUEEZE POTENTIAL bonus.  I would say the movement today is 75% price equilibrium + 25% squeeze sentiment.  Im sure there will be more bad days, but if the stocks current value of 62.30 represents 75% value and 25% squeeze sentiment then that means the actual value would be around $46.725.   Not terrible.  It could be $9.00.

What do you imagine will happen when GME comes out with some positive news? DEMAND.  Us BAG HOLDERS are also cream of crop of holders right now after just losing our shit 50-90%.   If your holding now, your officially a diamond handed smooth brain.   DEMAND WILL RISE AGAIN.  

When your at the bottom there's always room to move up.    In all reality, it seems like DD'ers believed this was an investment rather than JUST a SQUEEZE SPEC.  That STILL applies.   Dont get all fucked up, okay?  I mean, whatever I have to tell myself to feel better right?",2021-02-06 07:12:33

""The Financial Services hearing, set for Feb. 18, will be split into two panels: one featuring government and industry investment regulators, and the other focused on the businesses and investors central to last week's stock market chaos.


The tentative plan for the hearing is not locked in yet, but would begin with a panel including representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the securities industry's self-funded internal regulator; and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the clearing house used by Robinhood to finalize stock transactions conducted on its platform.


A second panel would include Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, representatives from financial industry trade groups, and a Reddit executive.""

The various brokers and hedge funds allegedly conspired together to knowingly deprive retail investors of the ability to invest in the open market during an unprecedented stock rise, in order to benefit the hedge fund companies, such as Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Maple Lane Capital. The lawsuit alleges that the online brokers involved froze the everyday investors out to enable the hedge funds to stop losing money when the stocks rose in value.

The lawsuit continues to allege that Robinhood and nine other online brokers failed to provide duty of care to their customers and that they purposefully harmed their customers positions in GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) and twelve other stocks, such as Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), K055 Corporation (NYSE: redacted), and nak3d Brand Group Ltd (NYSE: redacted). The lawsuit is also alleging that Robinhood was recently fined $1.5M by the SEC, and a monitor has been assigned to watch their activities closely.

This class action is the first and only one to include all six hedge funds, all ten brokers, and all thirteen stocks.

The case is 3:21-cv-00167, Nordeen et al v. Robinhood Financial LLC et al.

The plaintiffs are represented by the Law Offices of Gary R Carlin APC, a Long Beach based law firm.

GME: Where are we right now?,0,ldh8jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldh8jf/gme_where_are_we_right_now/,23,1612587844.0,"Guys I’m going to admit I’ve been losing confidence in GME lately... you might not like what I’m going to have to say and you can all downvote this if you want but I don’t  care because I just want to get a perspective out that I think could have some merit to it and y’all’s response to “where are we right now?”. 

Last week we saw a large rise in buy volume on the charts for GME stock that took it all the way to mid $300s to almost $400s but all the while it  only took like a weekend for it to all disappear. Now GME is in the $50 to $60 range and has been fighting for its price tag. This morning looked like we had day traders do a mini pump and and dump. As much as I want to believe this  movement started as a good cause of short squeezing a hedge fund I don’t know anymore where this stock is headed without whichever big funders’ who pumped and dumped our stock. I feel like they got greedy and left with what they put in and some of our money. 

I know pump and  dump is a strong accusation but it feels and looks like that’s what happened on the volume sheets and charts. I think someone saw this as as a disguised opportunity to plus off newbie or inexperienced investors who saw a  day trade of a stock(which it obviously didn’t turn out to be) or a explosive stock by the end of a week. It’s been 2 weeks, and we’re now nearing the end of the second week with no sign of these big investors who pulled out on us reinvesting to bring the stock price up again. Consequently, we’ve been left “holding the line” and there haven’t been many positive changes to our stock price despite trading platforms removing restrictions on GME which I thought would reverse the downward trend. I admit I feel betrayed, angry, upset, and very discouraged not only for myself but for you all who believe in this reviving. Maybe it might? Maybe it won’t?  I just know I don’t want anyone else of us suffering more losses than we can afford. However, I know we’re still costing short investors billions and maybe that’s all we can hope for at the moment. But guys I’m just saying it like I see it. Things aren’t always what they seem and I don’t know what the game plan is that’ll make us our money back which feels like a long shot without more help. Conclusively, As far as I know, I don’t really see this going anywhere else from its stagnant spot except with more help. 

So I ask you guys: Where do you realistically see this stock going? And why?

Update: What’s y’all’s take on AMC? I see potential in that stock as it’s price will naturally(not artificially) rise due to demand once people stop worrying about COVID restrictions.",2021-02-06 07:04:04

MOVE YOUR SHARES FROM BROKERAGE/MARGIN ACCOUNT TO A CASH ACCOUNT,44,ldh6sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldh6sl/move_your_shares_from_brokeragemargin_account_to/,20,1612587709.0,"Lots of $GME is currently held in brokerage accounts. THAT MEANS YOUR BROKER CAN LEND IT TO SHORTS.

And since short interest is so high, any share they *can* lend, they probably have already. (Recently I heard the brokers had actually run out of shares to lend, showing how high the short interest is.)

If you transfer your share into a CASH ACCOUNT then the broker can no longer lend it. And if it's already lent out and the broker doesn't have unlent shares in other margin accounts (which they probably don't, considering they recently ran out of shares to loan) they will RECALL THE SHARE from the short and force them to cover at market price! If we all do this, it could force a massive volume of forced buying, sending prices to the moon as brokers are suddenly calling up shorts saying ""We need that share NOW"" and a wall of apes is charging moon prices for those shares.

Cash accounts vs margin/brokerage accounts info: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-cash-account-and-margin-account.asp#:\~:text=Cash%20account%20requires%20that%20all,the%20securities%20in%20their%20account](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-cash-account-and-margin-account.asp#:~:text=Cash%20account%20requires%20that%20all,the%20securities%20in%20their%20account).

Anyway, even if we can't get enough people to move that we actually hit that ""forced cover"" threshold, the less shares the brokers have to loan, the higher interest rate they will charge the short interests. That gives us extra pressure (by increasing how much the hedges are bleeding on their nightly interest payment) that will motivate them to close at higher prices.

I don't know if I even need to say it, but while your shares are being transferred between accounts you probably won't be able to sell them. But you weren't gonna sell anyway, 'cause MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO BITCH!!

Another squeeze is incoming if we can get enough apes to move their shares out of those margin accounts into cash accounts!

**tl;dr: moving our shares from brokerage accounts to cash accounts** ***en masse*** **would squeeze the shorts and force them to cover at any cost (as well as increasing their interest payments.)**

They lifted restrictions and look what happened. Amazing how fickle minded people are. Loved the abuse yesterday but only because I’m into that shit. 

WHAT DID WE LEARN? 
We’re playing mass market psychology now. Panic induces selling-something autists and wall st has known for years. Knee jerk reaction to stop the bleeding. 

Mark cuban basically explained to the world how non dividend paying stocks are basically Pokémon cards. The loudest mid on the playground screams about his charizard and its worth what WE think it is. 

Fundamentals like DCF, EPS, were all an excuse to drive up price and make commissions. All supporting speculation. 

Zachs and moody’s and everyone else with buy, sell ratings helped to back that, but chamath even said, you dont know what GME’s worth. You dont know what TSLA is worth. 

GME could pull a Tesla. 
What happened with Tesla? Nobody could explain it but here’s my theory: retail liked the stock. Some really loud kids yelled that TSLA was a shiny holographic charizard. No fundamentals and in a debt crisis. Retail Doesn’t care about that tho. They know who Elon is. They know he’s smart. They think Tesla is worth a lot. Cool. So it went to $1000. And they did a 5:1 split so every share was worth 200 and then people who didn’t get it were like damn Tesla’s  cheap again! Fear campaign didn’t work because retail had conviction they were right and enough people felt like they were smarter than newscasters and it was fake news to help shorts. Or they didn’t even watch news. THEY REALLY LIKED TSLA.
It went back to $800. 
Every fundamentalist is afraid to touch it. Shorts got burned and nobody’s talking about it because they don’t wanna admit they have no clue how to value that one. It proved Cubans point for non dividend paying shares being no different than a Michael Jordan rookie card. 

The only reliable thing now is momentum and mass psychology. THERES NO REASON GME CANT PULL A TSLA. 

Cohen smart too. 

If they allow freedom in market retail has power. 

Rh proved that today. 

GME to 1000, 5:1 split. And back to $800. That’s the one scenario in which we stop thanos. 

BB follows, not because short interest but because tech is good & bullish. Not a phone company anymore. Software! BB also moon

AMC - shorted to deathly bankruptcy but now has so much cash they will survive covid. Can afford a thinktank to pivot into modern trends. They wont pull a blockbuster who served as a cautionary tale of hubris. Could have bought Netflix for 17MM but got greedy. 

Last but not least,
NOK- elon is definitely up to something here. Idk but he seems like the kind of person with a back up plan to a back up plan. Dude loves the internet. Is epic shitlord troll (literally released models: S3XY). And he’s gotta be motivated by revenge for getting jumped on and almost having to take TSLA private. 
Tinfoil hats: Tesla could acquire NOK. 

What happens if you are short NOK and it gets acquired? Short HAVE to cover. Force an expiration date. Tsla buys NOK for cheap. Elon get to middle finger shorts and the SEC. TSLA led my smart genius could use Nokia’s already established 5g ready infrastructure in their cars. Not only can they honk their horn to move bitch get out the way! But also with nokias infrastructure you will be able to yell at the idiot that just cut you off through their speakers. Yeeeeeew. 

If apes keep eating crayons and buying and holding tomorrow, a simple retracement could turn into a TSLA. Crazy gains and price action on Friday will blast over the weekend and monday, we have momentum. Psychology proves everybody is going to chase it.

ALLEGATION:  SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL

Let's  roleplay, retards.  I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to  bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.

I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death.  Here's my plan.

I  collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my  transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME.   This  happens.  I don't know how, but keep going with me.

So  now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME  shares out of my account, or the jig is up.  They'd be caught as a FAIL  TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one.  So how do I never  sell one of these?  Shorting!

But  no no guys... not just regular shorting.    We... we would short.   EVERY.  TRANSACTION.      EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY.  It's more  important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to  boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the  market and get found out.  Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in  front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of  intercepting magic.

So,  we do this for a while.   Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't  enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a  couple go.   Well, let's wait and see what happens.

< INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME >  [https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png](https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png)

Oh,  shit.  Things are warming up.   People think Gamestop might really come  back.   If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5  million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it  from my account.

Oh, shit.   It happened.  A lot.   Look at those fail to delivers.   They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.

The jig is up.

I  don't want to get caught, so I hit my ""omfg algorithm"" button, that  will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of  those buy orders for GME.  I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll  HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.

They decided ""FUCK IT"" eventually, and traded in their **FAKE SHARES** for **REAL MONEY** at some point during this, and those are **FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS**.   THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS, **SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.**

THOSE  ARE FAKE SHARES, ""CREATED"" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND  ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD  HAVE COME IN FOR THEM.   AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION **AND** **~~ITS NOT JUST~~** **MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP.  \[Edited, im retarded\]**

===========================================================

please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler

Their  stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole  portfolio.  The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.

[https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe](https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe)  Edit:  maybe a better explanation? ::  [https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc](https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc)

Imagine  using your car jack while the handle is twisted open.  No pressure,  fluid is just movin around.  Even in this state, sometimes if you pump  it fast enough you can see little jumps of life.  The real solution  though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.

Visualize  their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide  capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in  which case it EXPLODES.    We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k  bids being filled right before everything shut down.  But in this  waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are  out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides  where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time  to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment  they overshorted, and it remains.  Its why they didnt bail at 20, or  80, or 115.  THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT.    This was the math all along.

This  also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are  finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine  this pool.

**TLDR:** The mathematical strategy of the situation is to **reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)**, and **grow the maximum red force (additive).**

We  have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of  red, quickly.  If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the  other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS  TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE.  IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY  BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE  COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.

Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally - **THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK**,  and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN  THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT **AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL**

This theory connects the dots.

**Please  if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read.  Ive  been trying via modmail, posts, everything.   Anyone with a platform  needs to know this.   Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the  profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their  ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.**

EDIT2:   omg melvin is so sinister.  They knew redditors would bandwagon.  They  are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME.  PLEASE  HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.

Let’s preface this with two things, 1. I have no idea what I’m talking about, that’s why I’m on WSB rn and 2. You’d be stupid to completely discredit foul play, Wall Street is happy to play dirty to turn a profit but right now those claims hold no real weight because screenshots of sell orders isn’t real evidence. I’m rooting for us as much as the next guy but let’s stay realistic. 

Anyways onto the meme sector, a lot of the $BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) have produced the same charts because they depend on the same trends. Hype, high short interest, and mainstream media attention? Buying frenzy. Trading restrictions on $BANG, a decline in hype? Bad news for ALL meme sector stocks, they all tank together. Add on top of this the fact that many people owned more than one meme ticker and of course they all moved together, it’s the same people and they all have the same risk averse tendencies. As much as WSB > Hedgies it benefits us all to understand why these charts moving together is because the people on this sub discovered a new niche market.

You don’t have to reply to every single person who is still holding. Trolling is hella fun but it’s so fucking old at this point.


It’s like two factions of children are in a tantrum fight with each other to see who can be more fucking annoying. If there is a GME post, expect there to be discussions about GME. Don’t go looking to start shit if you are against holding GME. Nobody gives a shit. 

If you think you should make a new post that’s similar to all the other low quality, low effort posts about holding GME or how it’s dumb as fuck, take a few seconds before submitting it to consider how fucking useless your post is and how much it contributes to the amount of shit that has been filling up this sub. 

We don’t need 20+ GME posts every single fucking day. We also don’t need 20+ anti-GME posts every single fucking day.

I look forward to a day where GME is reduced to a small number of daily posts and the discussions about it are contained within them. I also look forward where we can all disagree without going at each others fucking throats.

No seriously. I didn’t get rich on GameStop, didn’t expect to (I’m down like $40, keeping my one share open kinda like a framed dollar bill on the wall at the diner).

I’ve never been a finance guy, I was an English and cultural studies major. I always wanted to get into taking control of my finances, and I did to an extent based on the regular boomer advice, but for stuff like trading i was scared off because of all the mlm hustle cult influencer bullshit. Tai Lopez and shit

Now I’m seeing that a lot of what was so confusing to me is purposely so. It made me feel like the cost of admission was out of my reach and that I’d be working shit jobs my whole life. 

Now I’m looking back and realizing what I could have done sooner to build a nest egg for myself, and shit, if I took a handful of things more seriously I might not even have to work rn

But I don’t regret any of those poor financial decisions because that’s all part of the journey that brought me here today. I’ve been humbled like a mf in these two weeks though.

I’m the type of person who likes to dream of new possibilities in the world. Really wish I realized 15 years ago that I can just put money into etfs associated with things I really care about.

HOLD $GME,50,ldgqur,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgqur/hold_gme/,14,1612586529.0,"I'll, preface this DD by stating that I would like to consider it open source. I am more than open to comments and criticisms and I would genuinely like to hear your thoughts on what is going on with $GME.

After watching $GmME and the broader market trade the last few weeks I've become convinced that we have the power to move the market, the ""smart"" know this and they are scared.

**Firstly evidence for our power to move the market and what I have witnessed:**

* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hDWiOq9W/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hDWiOq9W/) \- this chart compares $GME vs the $VIX over the last few weeks, they have been trading in near unison and increase in $GME cause a spike in the $VIX
* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Zb1wzhg/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Zb1wzhg/) \- Furthermore we have seen how sharp spike increases in $GME can cause sell offs of the broader market (S&P 500). Exhibit A and B demonstrate the quick sell off in the S&P as GameStop ""MOONS"". I don't have any evidence however I would liken this to the raise in margin requirements from brokers and clearing agencies. This caused a quick sell off as positions were liquidated to meet margin.
* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/v738Nol0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v738Nol0/) \- Volume Profile:  A lot of the buying/selling column appears to be repeating which just seems odd, they don't on other days. Perhaps it was some shorts that had reloaded closing out a position or perhaps a larger buying getting in? I don't know too much about this so if someone could inform me that would be sweet!
* [Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)  \- This document describes the techniques that could be used to, "" circumvent certain requirements of Regulation SHO"". It is really complicated but to the best of my knowledge it describes complex options strategies that can be used to artificially appear to covering. The shorts could be using these strategies to ""Reset the Clock"" and be simply buying time.
* Furthermore S&P Capital IQ is showing the there are still 61.8 million shares sold short as of Feb 03, this is down from Jan 26th however it is still ridiculously high and larger than the overall float, which I'm sure we must have close to 5-10% of that held by heroes like you.

[HODL ](https://preview.redd.it/q98f20kywpf61.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f8797b0c1ad7f2ea8b43e9a6f162c785437a19)

* Lastly I will add that I have seen an increased volume and open interest in $VIX calls dated for February 10th that have strike prices much higher than its current level. This coincides with the February 9th sort interest data that will be released the day prior and will likely have an impact on $GME stock. Given that we have seen increases in the price of $GME are mirrored by the $VIX, I believe some ""smart money"" has details on the SI data and as such is hedging or looking to profit from an increase in the $VIX.

&#x200B;

Now what does all this mean. I believe that their is truly some shady shit going on behind the scenes. There is information we don't have access too, we may never but it seems like something is happening. Their is most certainly some kind of suppression at play and Wall Street didn't want us at this table. They may be slowly trying to unravel their short positions without causing any disruptions and that is why they wanted us out. It's also very possible that their are funds working both with and against us. Either way this is a pressure cooker that gonna that's gonna blow.

&#x200B;

**I will completely discredit everything I have said above by stating that  Lord Elon should buy in, use the Starlink infrastructure to create a game streaming service and once and for all f@#k shorts. Maybe he will drop a Atomic bomb on the shorts, who knows.**

Zom is a company that is working develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for pets like dogs and cats. On top of that they are speeding up diagnostic processes for veterinarians. This could completely the game for veterinarians making their jobs easier and making things less stressful for pet owners. Lots of people have pets lots of people their pet. Pet care seems to be a huge market estimated at around 10 billion dollars

Thirdly 
Zom has signed an agreement with Miller Veterinary Supply for the distribution of Truforma, Zomedica’s first product, planned to begin sales on March 30.
That should send the price to the moon hitting in my opinion at least 5 dollars.

Lastly 
There is also some hype behind it due to the Netflix series Tiger King not that this is a meme stock but I feel as if this will make more people aware of the stock and bring more traction to it


I'm just a retard this is not financial advice whatsoever this is literally my first DD just sharing my thoughts on a cool stock that I like and think will do well.

Tl;dr Zom a cheap stock that is increasing in price with a product being released in March

Thinking of selling $MAS,4,ldgpjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgpjm/thinking_of_selling_mas/,14,1612586431.0,"So when I was 11 back in 2011 my father wanted to teach me about the finance, and said he'd get a bunch of shares in a particular stock in my name, and that I could take it out when i was old enough.

Well I got $MAS (or masco) and i've held onto it for years. However i'm thinking of selling it to pay for something i desperately need. However, I won't have to take out all of the shares for the thing I need. So I was wondering, should I keep the rest in to bank off Masco, or put it in an account to let it accrue interest?

I know I don't visit this sub a lot (if at all) and i know now might not be the best time with the whole $gme thing going on. But i think it's important enough to ask online, and this is where one would ask.

(also, i dont think i have the skills needed to reinvest elsewhere, so this is kind of a one time thing)

nothing anyone says is certain. none of it is factual. anything and everything you hear about the market (other than stone cold data) is purely opinions and predictions. I keep seeing people say things like ""I thought the squeeze was gonna happen already, thats what people were saying."" thats on you. if that is the sole reason you are holding, you need a reality check. the people we are fighting have billions to lose. if they are not covering their shorts they are bleeding money through interest. this could take weeks, it could be tomorrow and a squeeze may never happen. either you're here willing to hold for the long run or you took a strangers word for more value than its worth and screwed yourself.  if you yolo'd money on a meme stock and you can't afford to lose anymore. cut your damn losses, you have to feed yourself first. but YOU made the decision to get into this. YOU transferred the money and bought stock. no one else.

It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers,5304,ldgn9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/,454,1612586244.0,"Repost, because gaybears admins 🐻🌈 

Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen?

It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here.

Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short.

Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover.

Hold your fucking shares.

Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.

Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking **ZERO**. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= *-$45* Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money.

Please get your head out of your ass. **if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.**

I know how much some of you guys love soon-to-be expired options, so ill list them first before any DD. 90% of you arent gunna read it anyways, although i know you would if you could.

I picked up 640 10c for 2/19. They were 5$ each. The stock is at 8.99 as im writing this and up .40$ from yesterdays low. These are cheap as shit. This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or r/options. So im mentioning it there in all 3. 

This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything, let alone short dated options. You dont have to buy them for this play, im just explaining how undervalued they are. 

10c for 2/19 (14 days) are $.05
10c for 3/19 (42 days) are $.20.
12.5c for 3/19 are $.10



Now onto the DD for Celestica:

Market cap:1.15B
Free float:108m
Avg Volume :310,000
Institutional ownership: 69% 🚀🚀
Many of our good friends such as Citadel are even increasing their positions.

*They have over 24,000 employees, brought in 5.88B revenue in 2019, and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide. Theyve been in business for 27 years. https://www.celestica.com/news/media-information

*Their most recent earnings, released jan 26, 2021, show an earnings of 0.16$ per share, as opposed to a loss of 0.05$ per share last year. This means that they were profitable during covid, and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies. 

*They have an “undrawn $450M revolver” as they put it on their site, or $464M in cash. https://corporate.celestica.com/static-files/e9830936-130f-44f6-9f73-3127402c00d5

So what the fuck do they do? Yes.

Celestica Inc.
Celestica inc. Is a provider of supply chain solutions. The company operates in electronics manufacturing services. The company offers a range of services to its customers, including design and development, engineering services, supply chain management, new product introduction, component sourcing, assembly and testing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, precision machining, order fulfillment, logistics and after-market repair and return services. Its products and services serve a range of applications, including servers, storage systems, optical equipment, aerospace and defense electronics, healthcare products and applications, semiconductor equipment, and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters. It designs, manufactures and tests solar panels for residential, commercial, and utility scale markets.

Im in this for the clean energy, innovative tech, supply chain, and aerospace. Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo.

We all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy(looking at you ICLN gang), and that its a main focus of many governments around the world. They have 6 locations in China, 2 locations in South Korea, and 3 locations in Japan. These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy. They also have 4 locations in California, and a few other locations throughout the US. Basically, theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation.

I can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs, including the new space one, ARKX.

Their linkedIn page is full of jobs, they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions. They pay their staff relatively well, (avg 60k per year with 32k/yr being minimum for warehouse staff.) The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of 3.5 stars on Glassdoor and 3.9 on indeed. Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit, which is very promising.

I dont know how to add pictures. 🚀🚀🚀
The only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation, there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre-covid. Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call. Before the march crash, the stock peaked at 9.29. At the bottom of the crash, it was trading at 2.63. Since then, they have rebounded back to over 9$ per share and are approaching pre-covid highs. Their 2019 earnings were negative 0.05$ per share, and their earnings for 2020 were $0.16 per share. Again, this means that they went from losing money pre-covid, to being profitable during.

Reasons I believe the stock is undervalued:
Very low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists, or that the company is dogshit. This company is not dogshit. A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B$/year in sales.

$CLS holds a P/E ratio of 8.86, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.83. 

$CLS has a P/B ratio of 0.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 
1.79. This alone makes them very undervalued.

$CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue, or sales. This is a useful metric on low volume/unheard of stocks, because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.31.

* CLS has a P/CF ratio of 5.83. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.35.

Please let me know if you find more/better information, or if something ive said is incorrect.


Tldr: $CLS is a tech/clean energy company involved in many promising industries. They are undervalued in every sense of the word, and their options even more so. They have extemely low volume due to being unknown, but are by no means a dogshit penny stock. Stock is currently trading at 9.03, and 10c for 2 weeks out are $.05. Yesterday they opened at 8.73, found resitance at 8.60, and climbed to 8.95 at close. 

Positions (again): 640 x CLS 10c 2/19.       🪐

I have a feeling that I'm going to be ridiculed for this ""deep value"" play, but alas, here we go:

I'm buying HRB leaps for these reasons:

\-I'm betting on a major pivot that will severely impact their valuation. Last year, they took on 3 executives of Information Technology. [LINK](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/17/1985861/0/en/H-R-Block-advances-transformation-strategy-with-new-vice-presidents.html) Additionally, their acquisition of Wave Financial in 2019 (Social Capital invested in this company in 2012) signals a paradigm shift within the company.

\-HRB tends to lag behind others in terms of SP recovery following a major market crash, but always come roaring back two-three years afterwards. (year 2000, 2012) There appears to be some correlation between economic recovery and people needing help with their taxes. I also view the rise in young people investing as a bullish sign for HRB.

\-Attractive fundamentals. I'm not wrinkly-brained enough to explain this in detail so do your own DD. I will mention that H&R Block's main competitor (TurboTax/Intuit) is valuated as an SaaS (P/S ratio of 13+) while H&R Block is valued as a brick and mortal boomer tax preparation company (P/S ratio of 1). If H&R Block can successfully make the strategic transition from a Brick and Mortar to an SaaS, or at least something in between, I believe HRB could be a multibagger.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

u/Precocious_Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. ""In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!”

Popular Interest in GME is Increasing and Remains Strong,19,ldgc5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgc5t/popular_interest_in_gme_is_increasing_and_remains/,10,1612585407.0,"Just did a little bit of research and thought the community may benefit from the modest ramblings of a degenerate gambler like myself. 

TLDR: The core idea is that GME's stock price benefits tremendously from momentum and popular interest. There is very obvious evidence that the two were correlated over the last couple of weeks, but I posit that they are causally related. I think I have evidence of two things:

1. Momentum is rising
2. Popular interest is rising

Finally, I argue that momentum and interest are causally related and that the recent correlation has some underlying explanation that utilizes both points above. This is not advice, I just like GME. I have shares and options (02/12 $305c!). Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about, feel free to correct me. 

&#x200B;

The data:

1. Google trends

A. [https://imgur.com/a/R94DcCa](https://imgur.com/a/R94DcCa)

2. volume:

B. [https://imgur.com/a/Bt72IcO](https://imgur.com/a/Bt72IcO)

&#x200B;

Search interest, stock price and volume are all correlated over the last few months, and especially so in the last week. It would be nice if we had finer resolution search data because we could see if the buying over the day is granularly correlated with google search volume (indicates that the two are causally related).  The first figure in 1A shows search interest over the last month in the US with daily ticks. I see a big spike when we were in the 300s last week, then a sharp decline, and the appearance of a recovery. Daily interest appears sustained, elevated, and growing. The second figure in 1A shows hourly ticks over the last 7 days, blue is the search term 'gamestop' and red is 'gme'. I see that interest in the stock was steady between the end of last week and the start of this week, if anything it peaked a bit higher on Monday. I also see that public interest is fading (the blue line probably approximates public interest, non investors who don't know the symbols). However, the red line is still spiking robustly, which I interpret to mean that people who are actually investing in the stock are still checking it out. Of course there is probably a mixture of GME shareholders and non-shareholders who still use the term, and you can see the baseline move a lot over time. My guess is the red signal can be decomposed into at least two components: the baseline (mostly non-shareholders) and the daily spikes (shareholders). I have the most confidence that the yellow line (term='gme stock') is mostly shareholders and it appears much more constant (shows a much smaller difference between last week's peak and this week's peak). All of this leads me to conclude that interest in owning the stock is starting to become uncorrelated from the media's reporting and is actually still likely increasing. 

2A shows the monthly price, volume, and change with daily ticks. 2B shows the last 5 days with minute ticks. I believe that both charts show that the volume is increasing again.  I think this is because restrictions were lifted and perhaps because uncertainty at the beginning/middle of the week is starting to dissipate. It appears that investors were still trying to play the early morning swings this week and interest in trading the stock picked up during the week. All of this supports my conclusion that buying interest among retail is recovering and setting up to spike again at the beginning of next week.

&#x200B;

Momentum is in part generated by trading volume and sustained price movement. You can clearly see in 2A that there are two phases: a green phase in the beginning and a red phase after the spike. Green days are more likely to be followed by green days and red days are more likely to be followed by more red days at least in the short term. However, dynamics can shift and the trend can flip. Today appeared to show evidence of that flipping and I believe it indicates we are more likely to have a big green monday. The morning price spikes have been getting larger over the last couple days since the restrictions are up. I think these spikes will keep getting bigger and bigger through next week. As momentum increases and those spikes get more reliable, people will be less afraid to hold through the day and the feedback continues until short meltdown. Looking forward to Monday, but diamond hands forever.",2021-02-06 06:23:27

DD for PELOTON,25,ldg66l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldg66l/dd_for_peloton/,24,1612584933.0,"Back to the good old days when people posted DD for stocks instead of just screaming BUY this.

**Here's my argument for Peloton:**

They just had their earnings yesterday and it dipped almost 10% in the AM and is on a **sharp recovery** mode. They far exceeded top line and beat all metrics - **the reason for the dip?** **Due to such high demand,** Peloton warned that it will face supply constraint. I like this kind of problems because the **reward for overcoming such issue is great given the amount of risk.** APPL had similar issue for iPhone 12 and it figured it out. AMD and NVDA is currently facing these issues. 

Why I like Peloton's business model is: 

There's a high investment to buy a unit. Once you reel in the customers, they need to pay monthly subscription. This is a great cash flow model similar to NFLX, COSTCO, etc. However it's even better because people will continue to pay for subscription after sinking in $3k for a peloton bike. 

I mean it's like a cult man... 

I'm still holding GME but that is a long term play for me and I need some excitement in the near term.

This might not be the quality DD you’re used to. English is not my first language and im fairly new to WSB (lurking for about 4Months). I personally own shares of this stock!
Ok with that out the way lets get down to business. 

TAAT lifestyle and wellness is a company which produces Cigarettes made out of CBD. I see great long term potential for this company. 

They are still fairly small but provide a good alternative for cigarettes. The reviews of the TAAT Cigarettes were very positive but unfortunately since i don’t live in America i couldn’t try them myself yet. They currently work on bumping up the production and currently produce 5800 Rods of Cigarette packs per day, which comes out to around 144000 per month, which is an estimated 5,76 Mio. USD per month. Obviously this isn’t even comparable to big Tobacco companies but the are currently searching for even more production facilities to bump up the production even further. So there is still a lot of Potential for Growth.
The stock also had a fairly good run growing 387% in one year with a lot of buzz around the stock the past week causing a 89% increase in one day. The hype died down a little bit and is thus Investment worthy again without having an for this stage overvalued stock price.

Their current expansion strategy involves sending out TAAT cigarettes via their only store to spread market recognition. This initiative is called TryTAAT and from what i gathered is pretty successful.
Im in on the long run and see a lot of Potential growth for this company.",2021-02-06 06:14:03

Naked Shorting - Who Didn’t Play By the Rules?,22,ldg34j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldg34j/naked_shorting_who_didnt_play_by_the_rules/,8,1612584688.0,"DD on Naked Short Selling, Failure to Deliver, and Short Interest - Who didn’t play by the rules?

First, some terms (skip if you know them):

#What is naked shorting?

The *illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist. 

[Investopedia on Naked Shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

#What is Failure to Deliver?

Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (e.g. I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)

[Investopedia on failure to deliver ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

#What is Short Interest? 

The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (i.e. returned to the borrower) 

[Investopedia on short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)

#How are these terms related?

While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena, *there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock.
[Predictors for naked short selling manuscript ](http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/121208.pdf) 

Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.

#Was there naked short selling with GME?

Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.

[Source for securities threshold list ](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)
[Source for SEC’s regulations](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)

Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales &gt;50% of total sell volume)

[FINRA short volume ](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-index.html)

#What does this all mean?

It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it. 

#Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?

1) Submit a TCR complaint to the SEC [SEC complaint form](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

2) Contact your local, state, and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset.",2021-02-06 06:11:28

I’m not at all telling people to do this. I am not a financial advisor and this should NOT be taken as financial advise. I just put pieces together and try to make sense of it.

I very well may be retarded and or Ill informed on the current buying pressure gme has. However I am STRONGLY not against doing anything that would benefit you, IN REGARDS to inviting people to be a part of “this”. (If you catch my drift) I know some people in this world just aren’t cut out to do what they need to do and that’s fine, play it safe. Do you, I don’t judge. Trust me.. 

Right now though, if any of you are still betting on gme to raise in prices  just realize that buying pressure is what you need now. Generally speaking... most people... or a large group of people found out about GME through social media, wether it was from post, memes, or social media influencers from all the big apps. (Twitter, Instagram, tiktok etc) . If you expect the stocks your INVESTING on to increase you have get gme trending on social media again. Again, I’m not telling you to invest anything in the stock market. If you support the movement your doing enough by posting on social media, but if you want to bring awareness to the movement going viral with GME is the wave we need to ride. I THINK. And very rarely does a ape think. 

And also If you think that gme likeliness to go viral again are low,  just be aware that “the bank challenge” has been going viral for weeks now, and we alll know about the effort they’ve made to keep movements like that going. So anything is possible. Point being Get creative and tell everyone and you just might pull this off. POSSIBLY.

I dont know, I never learned to read.  But hear me out. When you publish false material to the public on the status of your holdings, by, for example, saying ""we have covered all of our short positions in $GME"" when that position is a considerably large SI% or share of the individual stock, when in fact, you have done the opposite (still holding the same position) wouldnt that be clear cut manipulation? 

If you answered yes to that question, then perhaps melvin did indeed cover their position. Perhaps we are in fact holding the bag. 

I like the stock. 

But I see nefarious intentions behind a lot of what we read. Manipulation, and i cannot stress this enough, but TRUE manipulation doesnt and cant come from one source (there are exceptions). On this level you must infiltrate the source of the opposing side as well as controlling your own. We (WSB, reddit) are an open forum. Anyone can post. You think people have been attempting to convince the majority of WSB to buy x, or y only recently? You're wrong. It's not only the accounts that have 1, 2 or 3 days of existence. They have been here for years, they have karma, they are one of us to the highest degree.

Further more, deepfakes? Lmfao. How bout some good ol' fashioned photoshop, or simple data/source code manipulation? That's all that's needed to convince 3 million of us that licking_ur_moms_taint69 just bought 1m worth of AMC/GME Etc. You dont need all 8.5m, you just need a good portion after all.

I'm not trying to cause panic. I'm not saying buy or sell. I am saying fucking hold if you have it. Buy if you're a true autist, and sell if you're retarded. This isnt financial advice. But please; For the love of all that's worth our time: use your own head with the first question I asked. They cant so blantenly manipulate like that. our glorified WSB has, through individuals, claimed melvin lied. But that may of been the whole intent. Say the truth, get us to believe the lie.

If you're like me, you probably hate when websites and apps don't have a dark mode available, especially for stocks, because I'm often doing research late and the eye strain is rough.

Anyway, Yahoo Finance (Web) doesn't have any sort of dark mode, and I really like the app (which does have dark mode) and watchlist/ability to link a brokerage, so I didn't want to stop using it. So I spent the day editing the CSS to make it work for me.

Using it is simple. I use [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) to add Custom CSS to webpages (works for Chrome/Firefox, not affiliated). It works for me, but feel free to use whatever extension you want. Just paste everything from that pastebin link above into the textbox for your CSS, and make sure it's being applied to [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com). You should now have a working dark mode, including charts, portfolio, news, screeners, markets, etc. I tried to find everything that looked wonky and fix it, but let me know if I missed anything (or feel free to just add to your own version). I left some comments in the code to explain what some sections are changing, in case you want to adjust the colors yourself or add other elements.

For anyone unfamiliar with CSS, this ain't any sneaky deaky hacky shit, you're not gonna get a virus. It's just styling for the webpage.

Anyway, it was useful for me so I thought I'd share it to save some eyeballs. Let me know if you find it useful.",2021-02-06 06:00:12

I’m not a founder of this beautiful dance with hedge fund fuck-faces. But we’re all here now, and we have to hold the line. An example needs to be made if these fucks. SO... here’s my proposal. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. HOLD IT. If you’re getting scared, anxious, unsure of your financial future... remember that you’re probably helping to shape the future of finance in the US. You’re on the front lines of a war we didn’t know existed until a couple months ago. But, since this is a collective effort. So your fears need to be addressed. This is my suggestion. Again, *not* financial advice. 
First of all... if you sell shares and the price dips down, who do you think is going to buy those shares at an inflated price and then short them if this bubble bursts?? HEDGE FUNDS. 
Next... if everyone panics and sells their shares before they lose their shirts, who is gonna capitalize on the failed effort? HEDGE FUNDS.
SO... sell a little. Like 5%. Just enough to take some pressure off but not enough to topple our cause. Put some money in your pocket. Take your mom to Sizzler. Sleep well tonight. But don’t freak out. Don’t panic sell. Remember that your kid’s kids are watching how this turns out.

I made $5,000 on the squeeze and I believed in GameStop so much that I put it back in. From there, I lost $7,000 and finally accepted defeat. It’s time you get a little wake-up call.

Welcome to the jungle. Nobody cares that you put a second mortgage on your house to buy GME at $350. Don’t play with money you can’t afford to lose. Ever. Most of you apes are new here, so I’ll lay something out for you that nobody else will: you’re on a team of one. Everybody can post memes and pretend to be on a team, but in the end it’s every man for himself. You will be held responsible for the money that you lose, and no amount of rocket emojis can help you out.

Secondly, here’s a harsh truth: GameStop is not going to the moon. The squeeze is over. If you took a loss like I did, that sucks. Oh well, you’ll get your chance again in 10 years. I would sell while it’s still a greatly overvalued stock, but that’s just me. Regardless of what you’re doing, stop posting pure shit. This isn’t r/GME, and we can discuss other stocks here.

If you’re still holding GME right now, I’m sorry to say but you’re on the short bus with all the other bagholders now. This was never about “sticking it to the hedge funds”, it was about making profit. Those who are smarter have taken advantage of your hive mind, and you STILL haven’t caught on. Seriously, most of us realized we got played earlier in the week. When will you?

Since it takes a special person to bang another man's wife I decided to see if I could learn something from my wife's boyfriend through observation. 
Here are my totally empirical research results:
1. You need massive balls
2. You can't just squeeze whenever you like, sometimes you just gotta hold (her stocks).
3. If she's feeling down, buy some more shiny things (stocks).
4. Just like marriage, he too is in it for the long run.
5. Sucking dick behind a Wendy's is always a good way to earn cash if you're desperate.

Why I bought in on AMC and why I'm going to HOLD,55,ldfjxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldfjxy/why_i_bought_in_on_amc_and_why_im_going_to_hold/,33,1612583312.0,"Here's why after watching all this going on the past week I decided two only do two things.

1. bought 1 put option on GME (all I could afford) when it was at $320. I was late to the party to ride it up, so I rode it down. Sue me.
2. Bought 300 shares AMC at $7.50 and I'm going to hold. After watching it play up and down and not hitting that mark I misjudged and thought that would be the floor. We can see it went a bit lower. That's OK, I grabbed this intending to hold it, not expecting any instant return. I can live with a little red for now.

Why buy and hold AMC? I personally go to the movies 2-3 times a week. I go to AMC only. I started going the day they reopened theaters ( I saw Back to the Future that day). It has been dead, Dead, DEAD from then until Christmas. I usually was the only person in the theater with a private showing. Even on Fridays. That's not the case anymore. In my area restrictions are the same as they were before but now I never have a theater to myself. Even old reruns have 3-4 people. I'm seeing couples and people bringing their kids again. Even on midweek days. Sure, they only have one or two showings per film per day, but that's all going to change as the demand grows. and is already has been.

People want to go out again, and are already, and we are still in the deepest part of the pandemic. As we get the population vaccinated there will be less and less holding anyone back. Two years of big titles are ready to release and coming. AMC is going to dominate the marketplace. I wouldn't be surprised to see a merger or them possibly making a deal to acquire Cinemark (which actually I don't want to see, because I'm sure that would make holding AMC an even longer play). They already just shed 600M in debt. That's a huge boon to their bottom line. Come summer they will be profitable. In Fall they will kill it.

Just a recap for those who don't remember. The stock was trading at $3 when movies were literally playing to empty auditoriums, and they were about to declare bankruptcy. Now they made over HALF A BILLION of debt vanish, bankruptcy is completely off the table, movie goers are significantly up and rising, and we are rounding the corner on the pandemic. All that changed for them, and you're telling me that makes them only worth $3.50 more? ""Well, they are still losing money right now!"" OK, you're right. You think they won't ever make money again? Not even with emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than they were before? As soon as they report a profit on quarterly earnings, that's when you'll see the price rocket. ""But, the business model is failing, it's all about streaming now!"" Yea, and when Jeff Bezos started selling printed books online they said he was nuts because it was all supposed to be about e-books on tablets. Now he's the richest man on the planet. Turns out people liked buying old fashioned books so much that he was able to use his platform to start selling them everything. He never would have gotten there if nobody wanted books like they said. The more complex the world gets, the more people like the simple pleasures they are used to. Movies aren't dead.

Nine months from now people without the balls to buy at the low and hold will look back and kick themselves when the price closes up 400% from now. Then I'll sell them my shares for over $20 and take my earnings and they can cry when AMC sits at $20-$25 for a year and then some because a fool today is going to be a fool then too.",2021-02-06 05:48:32

Time to get our minds right about $GME and the Feb 9th Short Report,347,ldfisp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldfisp/time_to_get_our_minds_right_about_gme_and_the_feb/,56,1612583220.0,"First off I'm retarded and don't know anything about anything, don't listen to me, not financial advice. Just some thoughts. 

&#x200B;

I'm super excited and sych'd for the coming days and week, looking for a MOON landing, and I'm also a realist. I'm trying to think like a HF in this situation. What would I do if I were in their position?

Feb 9th the new short data is released, so the HF's will need to make some type of play. These are the 3 options I suspect they have. 

Their options are:

1. Be honest, not manipulate the numbers, and publish the actual short data they have. This would be the dumbest move they could possibly do. There are so many retarded apes to get validation that the stock is still shorted >100%. If they do this there will be a buying frensy by not only WSB retards, but everyone that was sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what would happen. This alone could send the price soaring. If I were the HF there's no way in hell I'm doing this.
2. Fill their shorts and buy buy buy. This would certainly send the price to the moon, and the HF will take a ridiculous loss, but it would be a better option than #1 because there would be fewer apes holding shares. If I'm the HF, seeing how we were able to manipulate the market this week, I'm not very inclined to take this loss. 
3. The HF can do what they know how to do best, and continue to manipulate the market. They can manipulate their shorted stock so that the % is reduced on the report. They've been in the game a long time and know some nasty tricks that they can try. They also have a lot of friends with a lot of money, so as long as the stock price doesn't get too crazy, they could figure out a way to continue paying interest while they wait for us to lose interest and panic sell, thus reducing the possible squeeze. Given the reaction on WSB, the Media, and the amount of interest that was apparently lost in just 5 days from many of the paper hands, this is the rout I would go if I were the HF. If I can hold out long enough for you to get discouraged and lose interest, then I won't lose my ass as bad. 

&#x200B;

Do not be surprised or discouraged, if they chose to do option #3. I suspect they will, and if they do, they will make it look like the world has ended for $GME, and it will be an illusion. They probably have the means to pay short interest for a while, maybe even weeks or months, but they won't be able to pay short interest forever. Then they will have no choice but to close their short position. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to HOLD. By holding we can keep the number of available shares lower, thus making the price rise fast when they start to fill. Look at the Jump that happened this morning. About 13MM shares changed hands in about an hour. Looking into it further the bulk of those trades were less than 10 shares big. That tells me that there's still a TON of interest from the little guys and girls, and if the HF is going to have to fill 60MM+ shares the price will be astronomical when they finally fill. 

Have patience, This will happen fast when it does happen, but we really have no idea when it'll take off, and If you can HOLD HOLD HOLD

While the stock went up, so went my mood, but the opposite is also true. If you would chart my mood and compared it with the stock price there is probably a correlation of 1. During the last couple of days I felt down, I lashed out and overreacted over little things. Also I was glued to the stock price constantly.

I'm angry the hedge funds covered their shorts the way they did (market manipulation, restrictions,  etc.). I was hoping for a change today when the restrictions were lifted, and hoped for a big uptick with all of your enthusiasm, but GME is up only by a tiny amount compared to the movements during the last couple of days and AMC is down.

Therefore, I finally made the decision to sell. I'm sorry everyone, but for me this wasn't worth it anymore. I have to prioritize my mental health and my friends/family.

I wanted to hold; not for a potential future profit, but for the principle. Also for all of you. I'm sorry to disappoint. If the stock goes up again, I'll be happy for you and I'll probably regret selling for a second, but this is still the right decision for me.

Expected EPS is -.11. They have beat earnings expectations 4 quarters in a row. They could totally beat expectations again, especially because the expectations are so modest.

But here's the kicker. Earnings were last released 11/3. For prior quarter, FOXA beat earnings expectations by 45.68%. The impact on their stock? It went from 27.40 on 11/2 to 25.63 on 11/4. So despite crushing expectations for the 4th quarter in a row, the stock still dropped 6.5%. I know nothing about Fox's business model except for Fox News, so I am fully retarded right now, but the prospects for Fox News are not looking good. A ton of Trump supporters pissed, Trump no longer driving viewership, the prospect of him opening a competing network, uncertainty in the future of the GOP. All signs point to it not looking great for Fox News at least. 

2/12 puts are pretty cheap right now. Stock has gone up 4% today. Seems like a good day to take a short position.

Unpopular opinion: We did it the wrong way.,54,ldf8ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldf8ra/unpopular_opinion_we_did_it_the_wrong_way/,29,1612582525.0,"Robinhood and other brokers restricting buying everyone’s favorite meme stock was market manipulation and needs to be investigated.
The fact that short interest can be at 140% needs to be looked into.
Retail investors having an edge over wall street, especially after the 2008 tax payer bailout is huge and will likely change some market dynamics in the future.

If you’re among the people who have money in this play, that you are 100% comfortable losing, you’re fine.

What we are seeing right now though is exactly the reason Wall Street calls us “dumb money”. It was foreseeable that people would still get in at the $200+ level and that those exact people would end up being bagholders.

The reason behind not selling at any level was, sure, support of the cause. But you know what else played into it? Greed. And that is exactly what drives the entirety of Wall Street, the very people you’re trying to take down. Greed. Money. More of it.

No one says you can’t have it, but you cannot expect getting it when you lack any common investment knowledge. 
Like taking profits. Why are people up several hundred percent on their positions and not selling part? Greed. 
Why are people investing money without properly informing themselves? Fear of missing out. Hype.

It’s beginner mistakes that so many new people on wsb are making. Do you know where the money that you’re down right now goes to? Right, the smart investors that established short positions at $480 because everyone knew there is no fundamental reason for this company to be worth more than 28 billion dollars. Likely large funds.

So here is the fundamental mistake so many  of you are making. You can’t stick it to a hedge fund if it’s you losing the money in the end, and most of you are. 
Please don’t take the confirmation bias of the thousands of daily posts telling you to hold. There is literally millions of members that don’t post their opinions, but these are the exact people that move the market if they’re scared. We were up 50% today and weren’t able to hold that. That’s massively bearish and indicates that people took the chance to take the smaller loss and get out.

So please, if you have money in this that you can’t afford losing, take part of it out. If you’re up, consider taking part of it out and get your girl a fucking ring or at least a nice meal at your local Wendys.

Wallstreetbets used to be looked down upon, crazy bets, wild plays, but it turns out many of those were just really good. I’m not reading anything from old school members anymore because this place has turned into a full blown mania. I love how many new people are finding out about stocks and options, but it goes a lot deeper.

We saw that we can get an edge over Wall Street and we will get there again, but we all need to play it smarter next time. Good luck to all the remaining players.",2021-02-06 05:35:25

It's not much and bots will probably downvote me but fuck it. Recently most of what I'm seeing here is just bots who are pushing people to sell. We all knew the risk we were taking when we were putting our money in $GME or $AMC or $NOK, etc.

It was never about the money. Those who are holding  now even with huge losses, they could've sold at 400+ and called it a day. This WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY. It was about telling those HFs that they can't manipulate us forever. Even if they DID cover their shorts, They'd still lost a ton of money.

They walked free from what happened in 2008, and that's why they need to know that people can stand up to them and risk it all.

I'll fuckin watch it go back to ZERO dollars and not give a single fuck. Money comes and goes, I'll make more.

Note: This is not a financial advice.

Edit: For those who are saying it's all about the money, The people who sold at a loss or are blaming this subreddit or bla bla bla, They were aware of the risks. Even if they didn't do their own DD, They shouldn't have put in more than they can afford to lose. The ones holding knew the risks and they put in what they can. So STFU about telling them they're wrong and fuck off, they know what they're doing.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Even if this was all for nothing and I lose it all. I've learned a LOT this past few weeks. I'll keep holding because it'll always serve as a reminder to me of this beautiful times we're living in. Say whatever you want, I have money for food and rent, this will always be a funny story to tell.",2021-02-06 05:32:29

At first I didn't even understand how the hell that even makes sense, but this goddamn whistleblower explained it perfectly the farther into the video you go. GME is a HOT buy at an amazing discount and this is coming from someone on the inside.

Latest news today from Reuters courtesy of S3 Partners: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-stocks-shortinterest/numbers-of-gamestop-shares-shorted-dips-further-s3-partners-idUSKBN2A51YX

""As of Thursday’s close, *25.4 million* shares were shorted versus 25.86 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $1.36 billion.""

Let's for a second take the number provided by S3 Partners at face value. 25.4 million shares are currently still short.

Looking at the math:

Outstanding shares is 69,746,960

Reminder that the above *does not* include: insider ownership, public/retail (you, I, and everyone else), etc. We may not know the float, but we know the outstanding shares. The numbers just don't add up.

It's clear no matter which estimate you look at, the situation is dire since the shorts will eventually have to cover their postion. Maybe not all at once, but any catalyst/good news will only put more pressure with a steady trajectory up.  It appears the squeeze was gimped and an inevitable squeeze has yet to run its course.

Again, nothing about the numbers above have factored you and I into the picture, which you can imagine only compounds the situation. GME looks to be a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. Thoughts/comments are welcome if I'm missing anything.

But shouldn’t there be a lot of interest in aerospace stock right now? I’ve been investing in aircraft manufacturing for the last 6 months and they’ve all just been stumbling forward. To me it seems like companies like Airbus and Boeing should be doing really well because people would be investing in stock now in order to reap the benefits of their inevitable recovery once air travel rejuvenates - but these stocks seem to really struggle. Is there a factor I’m not seeing? 

Boeing has some additional issues with their 737 max crashes - but shouldn’t that help draw interest in people waiting for the inevitable recovery?? A company like that HAS to recover, why aren’t investors buying up stock like these?

Context: I’m NOT experienced with investing, but I’m pretty familiar with the aerospace industry (I’m a grad student studying aerospace composite materials). I have a mostly aerospace portfolio because that’s what I know, but I’m really struggling to gain any profits here, I’ve basically just broken even over the last year.",2021-02-06 05:27:19

I've been cruising WSB and spending a lot of time doing financial research to try to make the best decisions for me and my family. At least the best decisions a degenerate ape is capable of 🦍🦍🚀🚀.

During my time researching primarily via YouTube videos and research articles on SA I came to know a number of figures in the precious metals community.  These individuals work very hard and put in a lot of thankless hours despite the precious metals markets being among the most manipulated in the world. There was a lot of buzz last week in that community because of the garbage misdirect tactics run by CNBC, which made me feel bad.

It isn't your turn yet, we're kinda busy holding down some hedge funds at the moment but know that there are plenty of folks that haven't forgotten about you.  Artificially suppressing the price of commodities is a crime and if the rumors are true it deserves much more investigation and penalty than the pathetic fines collected thus far.

I just wanted to clarify some points. 

There's no way for retail to totally beat the hedge funds and the big guys with a short term time horizon like we've had here. As we saw with Silverlake and some of the hedge funds that made tons of money off GME, AMC, etc. 

Now I know what I'm going to say next is not very wallstreetbets but it's something that the people who are new to investing need to hear. When you stretch out your time horizon the odds flip. If you look at the average returns of hedge funds since 2008 they don't beat the market. That means all you have to do to make more money than them is buy index funds. 

[Here is a great blog post](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/02/how-the-dumb-money-won/) about how the little guy can win.

Put your money in index funds and over time you're almost guaranteed to win. I know it's not flashy and it won't change your life tomorrow. But don't let this drive you away from the market for the rest of your life. Because if it does you will miss out on enormous amounts of future wealth.",2021-02-06 05:22:23

We can possibly reverse our $GME losses by restricting our shares from being borrowed. Read on ...,30,ldexkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldexkw/we_can_possibly_reverse_our_gme_losses_by/,8,1612581714.0,"It seems like the shorts have an almost unlimited access to borrowing shares to short them (sell them). With $GME it's a win-win game for them. They borrow the shares at the current price. They dump them on the market. The price of $GME goes down, they re-purchase at a lower price and pocket the difference. So, they can slowly drive the price down and make multiple short-sales on the way down.

There is a way to make their life much more difficult right now. I've now verified this with two brokerages: TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.

We have to disallow our $GME shares from being borrowed by the short sellers. How do we do this? We have to remove the ""margin"" feature from our account. The ""margin"" feature allows you to borrow money from the brokerage to buy shares long. It also allows you to borrow shares from other brokerage customers to short the shares. If you are a responsible investor, you don't want to buy on margin. This is a really bad idea. Now, you may want to try to short shares yourself, but shorting is a very dangerous game, as the downside on a short position is virtually unlimited. With shorting shares, even if you are borrowing less than you have cash in your account, you still must have the margin feature enabled. If you have the margin feature enabled, you automatically allow others to borrow your shares for shorting.

If you want to try to fight back now, this is what you can do:

1. Call your brokerage and tell them you want to restrict your shares from being lent to others for short selling. Expect them to tell you that you need to remove the ""margin"" feature from your account.
2. You can request right then and there that the margin feature be removed from your account. This will require that you don't have any pending or waiting orders right now and that  you cannot trade out of that account for two business days. (at least those are TD Ameritrade requirements).

That's it. If you are not planning to sell or buy more shares in the next few business days, and if you call today to request that the ""margin"" feature be removed from your account, you will start fighting the short sellers back.

Now, if you have already bought $GME on margin, then you can't disable the ""margin"" feature. You should never have bought $GME on margin. If you have pending orders, you will most likely not be able to disable the ""margin"" feature. If you are not planning to hold $GME for the next two days and are planning your exit from $GME, you should not be disabling the ""margin"" feature now.",2021-02-06 05:21:54

They aren’t playing by the same rules, they have the ability to reduce their/ or numb their own FUD, and will take you for a ride and then discard you.

**LASTLY, REMEMBER.**

For GME. Realise that FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) are just states of mind. Depending on who raises you or who you will surround yourself with, no matter what, make an effort to treat each and every moment or opportunity that you may receive with a grounded perspective and objectively.

Also, be able to be your own therapist, because the sooner you realize that who and what you learn will shape who you become, and that nothing is inherently known or given. But, are rather things that come up, or you will have a take on, or a perspective that may not be necessarily true or valid.

You’re human, prone to error at some point, that’s fine. So always try to see that you were being fair, grounded, respectable, mature, in all these things will help you focus and guide you into a direction that would put your life in a better position.

Take solace that this happens to everybody. There is not an individual who will not face this, with yourself and your own consciousness in your mind type of feeling. That you only have yourself and don’t try to explain that to anybody.

You know, be able to rationalize it, to break it down, to contextualize it, but use it to better yourself and others, please.

If you’re like a super young person reading this, or just any other person, like me :), you may see it as themes of “self-actualization”,  “third eye”, or “vibes.”

Well, that’s what you shoot for as a person. Your parents or friends/family ideally would help you achieve it. If they don’t, get new family and friends.

If not, you may want to achieve this sooner rather than later to deal with the realities and harshness of the world or you will SUFFER more than you would have too, rather than if you had the tools in your toolbox.

I’m only 22, and some people learn this as kids, younger, older; some never achieve it, now that’s hell.

I unknowingly spent more than I could afford to lose.

So, late last week I had $1500 in savings and really liked the stock, so I thought let's see if I can double what I have. I am unemployed and have been for a few months. I probably should have been smarter given my situation, but I thought YOLO instead. Ive been using unemplotment to pay my bills, which are pretty significant, while I search for a job. My career has been wrecked by Covid making it difficult to find a job. Then, this week an incredibly horrendous situation occurred with my unemployment.

The issue is that they are claiming fraud on my account for not verifying my ID within a week of when it was requested. I sent it a day late and now they want me to pay back the entire $4800 that I have been given. Obviously, this is catastrophic for me as I am still without work and don't have the means to pay this, not to mention that it was a simple mistake that could be easily resolved. However, contact with TX Unemployment seems impossible, and my appeals online are going nowhere.

They are asking for the money to be paid soon, and I don't have the means. This has the potential to ruin me, and frankly seems so ridiculous!

Regardless, I want to be optimistic that $GME might come to my rescue. Its not like if I sold now it would make a dent in how much they want anyways. This is my first time investing and I don't know what I am doing, but I am in it now. I am gonna stick it out, maybe it will fix everything.",2021-02-06 05:14:58

The Stop-Loss Play,18,ldehzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldehzl/the_stoploss_play/,2,1612580605.0,"One question we need to ask RE: the dirty tricks being played around $GME and $AMC is ‘Qui Bono’ - who benefits?  And how?

With this in mind, I realized that one way for the HFs to triage - especially in a battle against retail traders (many of whom are novices and/or have a lot to lose) - is to force stop-loss calls.

Traders may place well-intentioned stop-loss triggers on their shares in an effort to avert disaster.  But this exposes a vulnerability to exploitation, especially in a short squeeze situation where prices can have crazy swings.

If the price drops, this can cause stop-losses to trigger and a bunch of shares suddenly go out of the retail investor’s hands and up for sale at a discount.  This is counter-productive to the BUY and HOLD strategy that many (including myself) are using.

GME and AMC are extremely volatile, and prices can spike and plummet.  Be careful that your stop loss triggers don’t betray you.

This is not investment advice; I am not a financial services professional and I’m pretty sure I can see the color blurple.  I like the stock. 🚀🚀🚀

That's probably what caused our early spike to the $95 before shorts panicked. Right now it's a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money. [Max Pain Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp) says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches, ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire OTM.

But there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.

There are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.

There are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I'm also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i've excluded them from the main numbers.

These are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I've also got so much GME that I can't do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.


**TL;DR:** In total that's 15,000,000 million shares they'd have to buy today of which they've only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That's a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice.

EXRO Technologies - A potential multi-bagger in the EV sector,25,ldedro,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldedro/exro_technologies_a_potential_multibagger_in_the/,6,1612580305.0,"Exro Technologies, a company out of Canada has recently generated a lot of hype as a potential big player in the EV battery market.

Exro is a clean tech company that has developed a new class of controller that dynamically enables multiple power settings in a single motor making it faster, stronger, and smarter. Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology.

Exro combines its patented software and hardware with in-house design, development testing, and final assembly at its Calgary Innovation Center for the most cost-effective solutions.

Exro is putting the intelligence into energy management and seeks to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.

I will summarize what I know and what I have learned from my investigation

1. As per CEO, their Projections are: Revenue should start from end of 2021. EBITDA +ve from 2023
2. Business model -> If its a low volume high value, they said they could manufacture themselves. If its volume business , they will either engage Contract manufacture it or do a licensing deal with OEMs who take care of manufacturing. Most business will be done in the license model
3. MOAT : They hold patents in different regions. They claim, each customer's work will be customized design for the customer and since their main work is software, they believe it will take years for someone to reverse engineer it.
4. Competitors - CEO claims no competition. The problem statement is widely known. My personal investigation to date suggest that there is/are other competitor(s) around, but they have their own solution. Question is, who has best efficiency & range and can they start commercializing it soon?

There are many ways seen to solve the problem :

i) Motor companies who use expensive Permanent magnet motors (made of rare earth metals). These are expensive but performance is great

ii) Semiconductor technology: Silicon-Mobility a French private startup, are working on same problem. Their solution is based on similar, software tech but this through semiconductors...Exro is micro controller but directly on the motor. Silicon-Mobility claims they can better performance & torque by 10-30%. Exro is also same or more. Silicon-Mobility do have couple of good partners (Valeo a auto ancillary and AVL autotech company). But IMO, they are a bit behind in commercialization, at least from what I know. It will be one to watch out for in future...if they ever go public.

End of the day, the electrification and solving the Differential Torque problem in Electric Car wont be solved alone by 1 company for entire world.

Exro has so many use cases and the opportunity size is huge.

Their current plan is to use these prototype partnerships and get the test benchmark data. Suppose Potencia testing gives benchmark data for electric car (converted from ICE by Potencia) and a electric Van. The data they get out of this testing will then be used and benchmarked against commercially available electric car data. If Exro finds enough proof that their tech is better, then they can go to the bigger OEMs like GM or Ford or whoever and get seat at the table.

If Potencia works, then Exro's target IMO should be likes of GM & Ford who want to do the volume business. They also have several partners listed on their site here: [https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/](https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/)

**The latest press release is super bullish**, and shows they are about to enter the commercialization phase with their first order of the Coil Driver - [LAND Electric Motorcycles to Order up to 2,000 Coil Drivers from Exro](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/land-electric-motorcycles-to-order-up-to-2-000-coil-drivers-from-exro-301222231.html)

This news came out of nowhere as LAND was not a partner previously, and today, the stock is hitting all time highs on this news.

Ok first off to the smooth brain apes that held. You may have more wrinkles than everyone thought. 

Once restrictions were lifted GME broke out! What does this tell us. 

First off you dipshits still haven’t moved your cash to another broker (fidelity possibly E*TRADE don’t do TD and webull shut it down again today as did RH I believe). 

Second once it was restricted it tanked again. 

Third and very importantly the market tanked during that time, this is very important. SPY lost $1.5 and quickly recovered once restricted again. 

What do these things mean? 

Momentum is not lost, there is still high demand for these stocks BUT we are still restricted because we aren’t moving our liquid capital to another broker. 

There is still a high percentage of short interest. If there wasn’t the whole market wouldn’t shit the bed if it was just retail running the stock up. 

The shorts are hard at work bringing it back down now that they control the playground again. 

My take away? This is still the play. Move your fucking money to a real brokerage this weekend and be ready for next week. Keep your shares in RH and the like, but stop any further transactions. 

Some of you wrinkle brained 🤡 made a shit load of money and sold before the huge drop. Obligatory Congrats and fuck you. But if you still want in this play toss 1/4 of your winnings at this discounted price. You get a second ride on the rollercoaster. 

This is going to/may be a long term play BUT if we move to a big boy brokerage house they won’t be able to stop it! 

This is NOT financial advice just a general observation of today’s events. Do your own DD and play only what you can afford to lose at your own risk.

I have left 600$ from my 2 years of hard savings (bag of GME and 2 AAPL). Nobody will give me back that money here, no one gives as hit how much I fucked myself (did kinda a lot), even if that would be like lunch money for them. But I took the risk and now I am holding either to make buck, or sink with the ship and regret hopping in the casino.

Stop being mad because you bought lotto ticket, threw it away without scratching the last number on it. This sub was something I never experienced before, when I joined. But now its worse than my FB, or Instagram main page. 

As far as I am aware, the posts I saw years back, this was always casino.

And the moving of the goal posts every day decayed your holders. 

I’m still convinced GME would’ve hit $1000 and beyond, but the moves by retail brokerages were coordinated tactics based off of a playbook that ape gang handed them on a diamond platter. 

For everyone that bought high and claiming diamond hands, I don’t think you understand the narrative. You’re holding for the squeeze, while all the OGs are holding because it’s a great investment at the end of the day and can play out in the long term. These are investors that bought shortly after, or with DFV, not at the top calling him God. 

As someone who bought in at 112 and saw the writing on the wall and pulled some actual tendies, good luck, downvote me and have your fun. If you bought high and are convinced “any day now”, you’re trapped in a small cave.

I know you guys can't read for shit, so I'm putting the **tl;dr** right here.

**tldr :** 

Donkey Kong's big dick swinging is gonna take us to the moon sooner or later. When you want to board the rocket is your choice. I've already strapped in and have my helmets on.

Retard play for the gamblers out there- 

**DKNG 70$ 2/12** \- To the moon or bust.

Safe plays for all the pussies out there -

**DKNG 70$ Jan '22**

**DKNG 90$ Jan '23**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay now lets get to the good parts. Here are the catalysts - 

**SUPERBOWL is this week baby :** 

Do I care about the Superbowl ? Fuck no. Is Tom Brady still playing ? Fuck yeah. Pretty sure you've seen massive advertisements for DKNG this week. Superbowl for them is like Singles day for BABA or Black Friday for AMZN. You bet people and their grandmothers are gonna gamble. And they're gonna gamble hard. It's gonna be all over the news in the US, and you bet it's gonna be all over the world if Tom Brady wins another one of these. As is tradition, Donkey Kong is gonna come out next week, swinging his big dick, bragging about their numbers, which are gonna be higher than Snoop Dog on a Saturday. You know what's gonna happen next ? Hint, starts with F and ends with O. You guessed it right, FOMO over the hottest player in gambling right now - and that is where the money starts pouring in, enough to send us into orbit. This is also their first Superbowl as DKNG, and it is gonna be massive.

**Mommy Cathie is IN !** 

You bet mommy Cathie is into gambling. She has smelled blood and ARK is in ([https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/arks-cathie-wood-wagers-on-draftkings-wins-8-2bn-of-new-money/a1459266](https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/arks-cathie-wood-wagers-on-draftkings-wins-8-2bn-of-new-money/a1459266)). Let me quote here for you simps - 

> ARK Invest has taken its first position in DraftKings and believes that online gambling could grow by 10 times its current size.

You think Mommy Cathie is in it to get some boomer like 20-30% returns ? Hell no. She knows that gambling is coming to the United fucking States of America big time, and Donkey Kong is gonna ride that wave at the very front. After ARK's investment, it has already gone up 10%, and will keep on going up big time as other investors get in on it.

**Sports betting is coming to US big time.**

It is a well known fact that many states (especially Democratic ones) are considering sports betting as a way to raise tax money, since the Feds under the Trump government didn't give them shit for money all of last year. Hell, Cuomo was literally begging for some cash on television. Tons of state money got spent on battling the Coronavirus. Gambling is the easiest way to raise some cash that can be spent on fixing broken roads, schools, you name it.

This is a map of all the states where sports betting is legalized, or has legislation that seeks to legalize it. 

[https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization)

Notice how **California**  is grey ? What do you think is gonna happen when the tech bros in San Fran get their hands on mobile sports betting ? What do you think is gonna happen when the frat boys and sorority sluts in Los Angeles and San Diego are gonna get their hands on it ? They're gonna gamble on their favorite teams like it's Las fucking Vegas. Hell now that you've imagined that, imagine what would happen **when motherfucking Texas** legalizes sports betting. Do you even know how crazy those Texans are about sports ? 

It should be noted that while **New York has legalized sports betting,** you can't bet using a mobile app right now, but Cuomo has been hinting about getting to that sometime soon. And that is gonna be massive.

Need I say more my fellow retards ? 

Mark my words, 2021 is the year of sports betting. **It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.**

Hop on this rocket as it is fueling up and enjoy the ride.

As you were.

Since last Friday, the top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 32% (Danaos Corp, Navios Maritime Partners, Navios Containers). I listed the three largest cap names in the title since those are all over $1B and apparently anything under $1B = pump and dump. But AMC apparently wasn't?! Okay guys...

As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance Navios Containers trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. ""Dia hands"" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!

The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like Navios Containers (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.

This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing Danaos has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and someone I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...

I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.

**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector. Sticking to names with market caps over $1B for the rules here- Atlas Corp (ATCO) and Costamare (CMRE).

**Common Pushback:**

1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon:

The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.

2) Is this like ""tankers"" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks:

Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.

3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon:

Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.

4) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!

I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips was one example of a horribly managed firm.

5) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market:

The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.

***Disclosure:*** I’m long nearly every name in the space- Atlas Corp, Capital Partners, Danaos Corp, MPC Containers (on the Oslo exchange), Navios Containers, Navios Partners, and Zim Integrated. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. ""Diamond hands"" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I sold CMRE earlier this morning and rolled it into ZIM).

I have about 10% of my wealth in the Navios names. Average basis in Navios Containers is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.

We are going to grassroots lobby our representatives with our own proposed legislation to help retail investors more freely trade.

In large part,  their response is the same: ""we will keep you in mind when legislation is proposed"". You better believe that corporate and hedge fund lobbyists are already working on their proposed language. It's time we work on ours.

Let's get specific with what new legislation we want to be implemented on behalf of retail traders, calling for more transparency and freedom in the market.

We can organize a grassroots lobbying campaign of our own, for a proposed bill of our own design to be put through Congress, which will set down laws that actually protect and expand the rights of retail traders, and provide more transparency, prevent the purposeful counterfeiting of shares by bad actors, and create new limits on short selling (for example, shorting more than 100% of a stock)

If we leave this up to the system, the bill that is finally voted on may weak, or at worst may even be loaded against us. If we can get the lawyers of the subreddit together to help write the proposed language of the bill, we can do a grassroots campaign of lobbying all our representatives to vote for our bill.

Senseonics is a medical device startup company in USA developing transformative glucose monitoring products that are intended to enable people with diabetes to confidently live their lives with ease. Utilizing breakthrough fluorescence sensing technology, the Senseonics continuous glucose monitoring (""CGM""​) system is being designed to be the first fully implantable CGM that is highly accurate and stable throughout its long sensor life. The system consists of a very small sensor implanted under the skin, an external transmitter, and a mobile medical application, which allows for discreet, easy access to real-time glucose measurements without the need for a dedicated receiver.

You can look at the system here: [https://www.eversensediabetes.com/eversense-cgm-system](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/eversense-cgm-system)

Being able to have real-time data and alerts about glucose levels can be life saving, keep in mind Diabetes is the nation’s seventh-leading cause of death, accounting for more than 79,000 deaths annually. It also [contributes to deaths from heart disease and stroke](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/diabetes/why-diabetes-matters/cardiovascular-disease--diabetes) which are the leading and fifth-leading causes of death, respectively. There are three major [types of diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/quick-facts.html): type 1, type 2, and gestational. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. Eversense aims to keep that safely under control.

They already have [FDA APPROVAL](https://diatribe.org/fda-approves-senseonics-eversense-90-day-implantable-cgm-body-transmitter-and-smartphone-apps) for the 90 days monitoring sensor, currently waiting for the new device for 180 days monitoring to be approved hopefully in Q1/Q2 2021, you can check here why it is still pending.[https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/senseonics-180-day-eversense-glucose-monitor-delayed-at-fda-by-covid-19-pandemic](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/senseonics-180-day-eversense-glucose-monitor-delayed-at-fda-by-covid-19-pandemic) As written in the article ""**The company has received** **word** **from the FDA to expect delays of at least two months for its application while the agency tasks its staff with emergency reviews of coronavirus tests and other medical devices, it said"" .** They filed in October.

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE ILLITERATES

**This is the biggest SPAC of all time**. If you follow this ticker you know that this is a SPAC merger led by famed investor Bill Ackman. I’m not going to explain what a SPAC is, *learn to use google dumbass*. The company is yet to be announced but is rumored to be announced sometime in Q1 of 2021. Some companies that have been rumored have been Stripe (plz god), ***Bloomberg***, Fidelity, Chick-fil-a, Subway (lmao), WeWork, SpaceX (no lol), WaWa, and many many more. Make no mistake, you are investing in Bill Ackman’s ability to find a mature unicorn and once the announcement is made, that is the company that you are invested in. Keep in my mind, when acquisition is announced that company will get a 5 billion injection of cash, so going forward it makes for a healthy company.

So who the fuck is Bill Ackman?

You may hate the guy or love him, but you can’t deny that this dude is sharp as a fucking tack and knows his shit. He also gets to fuck on **Neri Oxmen**, *so that’s tight*. I’d say his notoriety comes from a few different events so let’s do a quick recap.

1. Calling the 2020 crash: You can say his doom and gloom prediction before the Covid crash was an orchestrated event, but either way he was fucking right and that matters. Obviously, I don’t need to tell you what has happened since then, I haven’t been to a bar in like a fucking year. ***But this was one if the biggest trades in history turning 27 million in 2.6 billion by using credit protection on investment grade and high yield bond indexes.***
2. The Herbalife short: You can watch “Betting on Zero” if you don’t know about this, but he shorted Herbalife and exposed them for their ***predatory practices and MLM scheme***. Here he was “right” but still lost the trade (so wrong). Had he never announced his position in this, he may have **hit a lick here**, but you must foresee adaptation and adjustment, so he took an L. Did Icahn fuck him here? Yeah, but you have to admire the research and the balls he had for this call.
3. Valeant airball: a huge shitshow in which Valeant was boosting drug prices and doing shady stuff. He lost 4 billion on this. Obviously not a great look and *he has to eat the full L here*.

A mixed bag when it comes to his reputation, but I believe he does his research well and that combined with his business acumen is why I have a heavy (personally) position in PSTH.

So how will this play out?

I’m not gunna go over every rumor in depth, but I’ll cover some that I like and some that I don’t.

Stripe: This is the one that every PSTH investor is up late *at night touching themselves to*. If it’s stripe this will explode and could easily hit **100** within the year (maybe even day). I personally don’t think it will be Stripe, in an interview about 6 months ago he said they weren’t ready to go public. Maybe by the time he announces they will be? Some people are saying that there is no chance of a Fintech merger, he hasn’t said anything that would make me believe that. Does he have experience in that industry? No, **but that doesn’t disqualify it.**

Bloomberg: **My personal prediction** and my 3rd choice if I had to pick one of the rumored companies. Ackman likes to dip his toes into political commentary and philanthropy, both of which Michael Bloomberg also does. I just think this is a good fit all around, he said he loves Bloomberg and has had an active subscription since the 90’s.

SpaceX: This is pure speculation; this would go absolutely parabolic. I don’t even know the heights that this stock could reach if this was to happen.

Fidelity: I’m not sure where some of these rumors originate from, but I think it’s because they are eyeing an IPO soon. I personally use Fidelity so I like this, it’s app could use an injection of youth and 5 billion could *definitely do it.* Pair this with the recent influx of people who are going to be leaving platforms like RH and other apps using the APEX clearing house and you have yourself a ***possible homerun***.

Chik-fil-a: The lords chicken. Any food chain mentioned is a possibility due to Ackman’s background in food chains. CF is a good company, but there is a lot of hype surrounding this SPAC, I’m not sure this would be a catalyst for a big move.

Subway: People laugh at this one, but it is the ***largest food chain in the U.S.*** That makes this play a little better but *still kind of disappointing* IMO.

WaWa: I don’t know enough about this company, I know it has a near cult like following so that’s a positive, but again, the biggest SPAC ever ends up being a WaWa? wack.

PornHub and Onlyfans: LMAAOO. No fucking way, but would it make money? **Instant meme stock makes for a massive pump.**

Wework: I don’t know enough about this company to have a strong opinion, but I’ve heard positive rumblings about it. This would be wildcard, I’m not sure how the market would react.

So how to play this? I don’t fucking know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m looking for Billy SPACman to take me to tendie town. Personally, I think he will make a great choice, so I’ve been building a LEAPs position for months now. I also own shares, for the warrants. It’s also crazy that we haven’t heard a **single reputable rumor and it has been MONTHS** now since the SPAC was announced.

TLDR; Let Billy SPACman take you to the moon on his STRIPed Spacex rocket ship from your Fidelity app. Lots of rumors here, you’re investing in the individual.

Edit for 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Also if it isn't SpaceX, Bloomberg, Fidelity, maybe Wework, i'm not sure I'd hold long term.",2021-02-06 04:42:20

This is a comment I got on one of the Blackberry DD posts, It made me decide to read more and stop being emotional in how I support the company's progress. I decided to analyze all bear cases I receive Blackberry.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html)

""Millions of Ford vehicles will run Google's Android operating system starting in 2023""

This the Ford and Google press release title from CNN.

First of all, very bold for Ford to assume they are going to be selling millions of cars in 2023. Their top seller is the F150 is going to banned from sales in most of the developed world during this decade. This is a different argument for later, my argument here is how the press release was made.

This press release is kind of desperate. If your sales estimate is the first part of your statement and not the new technology you are announcing, then this is a stock pumping press release.

On the contrary, Here is the Blackberry announcement 3 months ago announcing that they signed a deal with Ford that paved the way to integrate Android into the system.

[http://www.qnx.com/news/pr\_6294\_1.html](http://www.qnx.com/news/pr_6294_1.html)

It’s a very technical press release. It’s very professional, what you expect to see from an engineering company announcing a deal. They didn’t say “Billions to be generated from a new deal with Ford”.

**With no pumping, What is the Ford and Android deal exactly?**

That means future Fords will feature Sync systems that use Google Maps and Android's excellent voice recognition, as well as opening up the platform to third-party developers. Ford will also use Google Cloud for its connected services, and the two companies will collaborate ""to create new experiences for customers.""

This is basically replacing the Sync 3 plus app. Android has an app already to sync your phone with the car. It’s like Chromecast for the car. The new announcement is basically saying that the sync3 app is going to be built-in inside the car. You can use it to open maps and have your other apps on and use an android voice assistant. Which exactly what

The car is still going to use QNX. Android can’t control car electronics. It’s a very sophisticated real-time processing of sensor data.

QNX controls the electronics of the F35 fighter jets. QNX was on the livery of Petronas Mercedes F1 car. Can you imagine how sophisticated it is to control the electronics of the fastest piece of machinery on earth? You can literally change the engine map while driving on 350 km/hour.

The good thing is that Blackberry responded. The company is paying attention to the people and keeps on assuring them. Blackberry posts regularly now on Twitter. They respond in a subtle way to the arguments. They probably upgraded their contract with the agency handling their social media affairs. They probably scan Reddit for them and the Blackberry PR team is aware of the conversations around the company.",2021-02-06 03:30:48

Haven't seen this mentioned here very much. Did you know that if you hold 100 shares of GME you can sell covered calls and it's guaranteed risk free money?,20,lddxud,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lddxud/havent_seen_this_mentioned_here_very_much_did_you/,33,1612579161.0,"By 'guaranteed risk free' I'm under the assumption that you plan on holding the 100 shares anyway no matter what.

\- Suppose you buy 100 shares of GME right now at $63 per share

\- Then you sell a 2/12/21 $150 covered call, using those shares as collateral, for $720 (Could have sold for a lot more earlier today)

\- You now have $720, no matter what happens. This is your money now, you can do whatever you want with it.

\- Your WORST CASE scenario (assuming you want to keep the shares) is that on market close on 2/12, GME closes over $150. The call you sold will get assigned, and you will be forced to SELL your shares at $150. So you will receive $15,000 for your 100 shares.

\- Math: $15k + $720 - $6300 = $9420 net profit

Even before GME started, more than half of WSB thought if a covered call you sold was assigned, you just lost the shares and didn't get any money for them at all, so if you still don't understand this that's okay.

Think of it this way. If you sell a call for more than the price you paid for the stock (EG - buy at $63 per share, sell a $65 call) YOU CANNOT LOSE ANY MONEY. IT IS LITERALLY A GUARANTEED GAIN! This doesn't factor in commissions, but if you are on a broker charging commissions then this isn't for you.

If you decide to do this, and afterwards GME skyrockets, you'll yourself down potentially over 1000% on the call you sold. Don't worry about it, just don't buy it back.",2021-02-06 04:39:21

What Wallstreet Bets has become,7,lddqlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lddqlh/what_wallstreet_bets_has_become/,23,1612578635.0,"For better or worse it to be determined, however it cannot be denied: Wallstreet Bets has become host to a social movement. As you can see between the divide of amateurs, OG’s, paper dicks, and diamond balls, this social movement is not necessarily defined by any one resolution. Within every social movement there are sub communities with their own goals and ideas, but what ties all these subdivisions together is a strive for advancement and a common home for identity. Take a moment, sit back, and really take in what has been accomplished here. 

Whether you have been here years, or weeks, retarded or just slightly autistic you are apart of a beautiful moment of history. As I see it, our common cause is obtaining equity. Regardless of your opinions of the players of Wallstreet or wealth in general, everyone here have been trying to create equity for themselves in a broader society that favors the institution over the individual. This is the American free market. This is the evolution of democracy. This is the attempt to democratize Wallstreet. 

“Apes strong together” is the war cry of any union around the world. When the first squeeze occurred, RobinHood answered by restricting buying and preventing any more price increase. WallStreet has shown time and time again they can change the rules when they lose. The legacy of the Diamond Hands Union is their attempt to reassert the retail investor as a player into a game not made for them. This union did affect the price. You saw that today. The trading restrictions were lifted and more diamond hands bought. The stock value increases. The demand went up and therefore the value goes up. 

This is what Mark Cuban was talking about. He never said it was a good idea to buy, but by buying the Diamond Hands Union can be a test of the power this union has. I would say forcing a stock up over $20 in 20 minutes is a lot of power. This is not about GME. I like the stock too. I like how GameStop actually seized this moment to expand their business options. But it about fighting for change in a rigged system. I am holding because people did not die for this country so I could live off my wife’s boyfriend’s Merrill Lynch salary. It was to keep the fight alive. So even if we are doomed for failure, I will continue to hold to keep that fight alive so my son can one day lose all of his life savings on a Wallstreet bet because of his own stupidity and not because some mosquito prick like RobinHood changed the game.

TL;DR: This is not financial advice. Obviously. I just learned how to write yesterday. Better git gud at sucking your wife’s boyfriend’s cock when you lose all your life savings.

"The technical term for one of the tactics used lately is, “bear raid”.",36,ldhwxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldhwxb/the_technical_term_for_one_of_the_tactics_used/,10,1612589682.0,"In the same vein as making your voice heard by voting, make your voice heard by contacting your local representative to encourage them to push for investigating this matter.

One of the tactics used lately is what’s called a “bear raid”. Definitions from Wikipedia and Investopedia, respectively:

From Wikipedia:

> A bear raid is a type of stock market strategy, where a trader (or group of traders) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position. The name is derived from the common use of bear or bearish in the language of market sentiment to reflect the idea that investors expect downward price movement.[1]
>
> A bear raid can be done by spreading negative rumors about the target firm,[2] which puts downward pressure on the share price. This is typically considered a form of securities fraud. Alternatively, traders could take on large short positions themselves, manipulating the price with the large volume of selling,[3] making the strategy self-perpetuating.

And from Investopedia:

> A bear raid is an illegal practice of ganging up to push a stock's price lower through concerted short selling and spreading adverse rumors about the targeted company. A bear raid is sometimes resorted to by unscrupulous short sellers who want to make a quick buck from their short positions.
>
> A bear-raid target is generally a company that is going through a challenging period, since its vulnerable position makes it easy fodder for short sellers. While short selling is legal, coordinated short selling is viewed as market manipulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and spreading false rumors is tantamount to fraudulent activity.

I think it’s important that we use precise terminology when calling for action. The blatant smear campaign in the media (especially CNBC) to sow doubt and sway public opinion, as well as the manufactured story of “squeezing” silver for the purposes of misdirection cannot go unnoticed. We must call out this bad behavior. Let’s do this!",2021-02-06 07:34:42

-Does the red circle signify when gamma squeeze was supposed to start and then dip after that is when they restricted buying and killed the initial “meme” momentum?

- And what if the two spikes in the green circle are hedge funds dumping the first half of the short positions in two quick but slightly separate dumps, and then other hedgies that knew the play exiting on those highs after buying in on the low points while retail buyers were blocked which started the price drop?

If there were only 1.7m short positions exited this week:

https://imgur.com/gallery/kLzbXSc - 2/5: 25.4m shorted

https://imgur.com/gallery/MsXQVz9 - 2/1: 27.1m shorted, down 35m from the start of them exiting their short positions.

(And this is S3 data who people aren’t really trusting as the official short report for 1/31 isn’t even out yet)

Then is there a chance they only exited just a part of their positions and another squeeze could happen?

I dunno this is all me just daydreaming and thinking aloud to myself, I’m not a financial advisor and I’m not suggesting anyone trade with my advice. I also don’t really think any of the short numbers out right now are accurate, or how much of the short positions reported are new positions set at 500, but I just needed to word vomit 😂

You can’t place OCO orders(once cancels the other; two simultaneous orders on one stock to both limit loss and set your exit point). 

ThinkorSwim by Ameritrade on the other hand not only allows these types of orders, but I’m reading that they even allow bracket orders, which basically will automate my strategy removing the need for calculating percentages with every damn stock I buy.

I would place a limit buy at $27.5 to protect myself from downside should the underlying increase and I get exercised. I would have netted $14 in premium and would need $2750 to cover myself. It looks like over the past year this would have worked for roughly 48 weeks, annualized the return would be about 24%. If it gaps up AH when it is near the strike I could lose a percent or two but it should be negligible. If it reaches my limit buy and dropped back down before I could close my position and sell I also face minimal risk. Do you see any flaws that I am missing?

These people are complete bad faith actors and totally unethical. Let me explain: They don’t believe in the the whole idea that the price will sky rocket due to shorts being covered. They lied to you and then sold at $500 when the stock was pumped up, leading to its downfall. They saw this entire thing as a pump and dump the whole time, now that they made their money, they are annoyed that their are people who “actually believe” in the “myth” of a second(possibly larger) squeeze. You are literally talking about the same thing they were a couple weeks ago, now they are acting as if you are retarded for talking about it. This is morally corrupt hypocrisy on their part. 

Now they want to shut the sub down and stop the millions who joined from discussing this idea, which very well could still happen.

Yes, people who sold GME(I say this as someone who never put a cent into it) you are correct, it doesn’t take some high IQ or knowledge in investing to realize that hype and trailing hedge funds drove the price to $500. But this wasn’t the original speculated reason for the short squeeze, that was hedge funds needing to cover shorts on a stock that was over 100% shorted, we still have the price $50 above what the price was when they sorted the stock. If they haven’t covered their positions, another short squeeze could still occur. You can not prove otherwise.

Anybody asking for the removal of GME posts because “I want my sub back!!!” Or “idiot apes don’t realize the squeeze has squoze” are ignorant, immoral, bad faith actors. They already sold and are out, for them, the whole thing was a pump and dump. DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE ARROGANT PEOPLE.

I’ve been trying to use papermoney in Webull to “invest” and apply my DD and it’s been going well. From what I can tell, if I were able to pay pretty close attention to stocks I could try to net 1k per week in income and probably be successful at hitting that goal 60% of the time. I’d want to start slowly and ramp up to that kind of money though. 

So, once I have started to invest several thousand and an swing/day trading to meet a personal quota I could possibly live off of that, right? 

I guess I just don’t really know how people make the transition from casual trading to having it be a main stream of income. Any big picture things I’m missing out on? Any resources (not youtubers please) that you trust and rely on? I’m liking TipRanks and the data vis on Webull is fantastic. 

Guidance is appreciated!

DD on GameStop's New Hires,85,ldicex,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldicex/dd_on_gamestops_new_hires/,29,1612590894.0,"So, as many of us know, and many of y’all don’t. Gamestop was a VALUE play. A Deep Fucking one at that… why do you think DFV didn’t sell? The squeeze was the cherry-on-top. Gamestop is currently undergoing a complete transformation with Ryan Cohen and his chewy boys, Chris Davis, Reggie Fils-Aime, Microsoft, etc etc etc.

This transformation has progressed as of Wednesday, Feb 3rd. As Gamestop has brought on another 3 hires in order to turn the tide. So, as any smart investor should, let’s take a look into these people and see what they bring to the table.

\-- The following info is pulled from Linkedin

**Matt Francis**

GameStop has brought on Mr. Francis as Chief Technology Officer, a newly created role in the company. Starting Feb 15th. Leaving AMAZON in order to join.

Mr. Francis seems to be a strategic pick by Cohen, as he looks to be the **King of Transformations**.

In 2004, Mr. Francis worked with the US Postal Service developing new software that helped evaluate and manage large pallets from their customers. His tech is still being used today.

In 2005, Mr. Francis worked with Avenity, developing software that results in over 30% of the company’s revenue and developing the business to over 60 countries. Re-evaluating and redeploying staff where it was needed.

In 2010, Mr. Francis worked with Marchex, developing highly scalable advertising technology. He led major releases and empowered development to move at a faster and more sophisticated pace.

From 2010 to 2018, Mr. Francis worked with Zulily. Completely rebuilding and re-platforming their entire company onto a custom framework. Introducing new solutions, and building scalable data platforms. He bootstrapped early versions of most of Zulily’s e-commerce software that they still use today across merchandising, customer service, and data science. He also built a full team of developers to maintain said software. He expanded Zulily’s presence to Europe and Canada. Executive sponsor and leader of zulily's cloud transformation. He led the evaluation of cloud partners for capability, feature, and cost match, negotiated multi-year, multi-million dollar partnerships with primary and secondary cloud vendors, and organized and led the transition, schedule and execution plans for multiple teams. Helping Zulily reach $1 BILLION mark FASTER THAN ALL BUT 2 OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.

From 2018 to 2020, Mr. Francis worked with FlyHomes. He was responsible for all of FlyHomes technology, product expansion, machine learning, and data science functions. Mr. Francis led the re-branding team, creating a new logo, website redesign, and new branding guidelines.

From 2020, Mr. Francis worked with Amazon creating scalable databases to promote growth. He promoted a [not-so one size fits all data approach.](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/C4E27AQEPR0C6eiLfiA/articleshare-shrink_1280_800/0/1612302292350?e=1612566000&v=beta&t=L3ZOOgZimvWRZvWKuqREiAy2oeDnimW59RBg8-NBppE)

Now, Mr. Francis has joined GameStop’s team. I expect Mr. Francis to use his experience throughout these past companies to help GameStop in its transformation. As he has done in literally all of his previous work.

**Kelli Durkin**

Kelli Durkin was Chewy’s Director/VP of Customer Service for 8 years. This is another example of Cohen bringing on his best players from Chewy. Think about how much people dislike Gamestop’s customer service, their low return rates, and such. I expect this idea of GameStop to completely change. Imagine the shift of meme culture on GameStop. Memes going from GameStop to giving you 3$ in-store credit for 400$ consoles to Gamestop giving you a full-time house, and a paying job for trading in a $20 pokemon plushie.

**Josh Kreuger**

Similar to Mr. Francis, Kreuger has experience in big companies like Walmart and Amazon. **He also worked with Mr. Francis on the transformation of Zulily.** This was a coordinated hire by Cohen, Kreuger and Francis worked together on Zulily’s transformation, now they will work together on the transformation of GameStop into an Amazon-like e-commerce giant.

**The Conclusion**

So, while many of you freak out about the squeeze, which may or may not be over, who knows, who cares. The real reason most of us bought in, in early November-December, which is what spiraled us to this point is the VALUE play of GameStop. That is the reason DFV bought, that is the reason I bought, that is the reason many of us bought at less than $20 and are still holding. GameStop has what Amazon doesn’t, stores all across the country that can act as distribution centers. I fully expect Cohen to build GameStop into a giant that mirrors Tesla's stock situation.

Tesla was the most shorted stock on the market, just like GameStop, it then grew to unfathomed heights and split, and continued to grow.

It is my opinion that Cohen will grow GameStop to a true value of $500+ that will then split and continue to grow. If you can hold, **HOLD**. There is no point in selling at a loss on a stock that will be through the roof in who knows how long.

TLDR; The new hires are strategic plays to further progress GameStop’s transformation. Hold. Gamestop will be a $500+ company that will then split, and we are all at a very nice entry point.",2021-02-06 07:54:54

Some Things to Remember as we walk into the weekend,27,ldi7w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldi7w7/some_things_to_remember_as_we_walk_into_the/,3,1612590562.0,"Disclaimer: I eat crayons for breakfast, and fill in coloring books with feces. This is not financial advice

1) The VW squeeze took over a month for the short squeeze to play out after the gamma squeeze (where we are).

2) The official short interest data that reports on Tuesday (Maybe? I've heard this may be delayed) will be reporting for January 29th. This information does not actually tell us much about the CURRENT state of shorts.

3) Stocks will go up and they will go down. Don't focus on the current ""media"" narrative on what's going on. Use your own judgement. If you still stand behind the basis of why you bought these shares to begin with (whatever shares you diamond hand bitches are holding) then just have some PATIENCE!

4) The lower the prices of these ""meme"" stocks go, the more powerful we are!! This actually gives us more buying power, so that as restrictions are lifted, as the squeeze commences, we can help drive the price up even HIGHER as we move forward. 

5) Don't get distracted. The HF guys (and majority of the media) want us to put our focus elsewhere. STAY STRONG! This is a great opportunity to average down even further, and increase potential gains down the line. 

6) DO NOT PLAY WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE! Sir, this is a fucking casino. Even with everything going on, stocks and the market (ESPECIALLY MEME STOCKS) Can be nothing more than a gamble. We are retards. We don't have insider information. If you're following the masses, and not investing LONG TERM into a company that you believe is undervalued or shows growth potential, you are gambling.

🐳 🪓 Unusual Options Activity 102: Answering some questions/ deeper dive,93,ldi7aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldi7aa/unusual_options_activity_102_answering_some/,49,1612590515.0,"*Love and respect all the GME apes.  That said, no. This DD is not about that.  But, to appease you all, I will let you know that there was very bullish GME call flow activity today toward EOD. *✌️ 

Long. Skip to TLDR if illiterate. 

***

After the last whale DD **Question I got most is:**

*’Yo.  I’m trying to use [Unusual Activity notifier, usually Unusual Whales], and the plays I’m picking are shit.  What do?*

If you’re arbitrarily choosing it’s probably about 50/50

The good news is that there are a bunch of things you can do to raise that 50/50 rate significantly.  **Last DD was, honestly, mostly a call flow thing—this is specifically for enhancing your whale plays, largely using Unusual Whales callouts.**

 Let's start with a random Unusual Whales play and see if we like it based on some stuff I’ll review here:

[I just picked this DKNG play randomly by scrolling through today’s UW alerts.](https://i.imgur.com/DZasrJ6.jpg)

**Beating the 50/50** 🐳 🪓 

I'm going to break the things I look for into two simple categories: **1) Urgency Indicators** and **2) Anomolous Indicators**.  Some relatively fluid combination of these factors--with a little bit of gut feeling thrown in--determines what I choose to play.

**1) Anomolous Indicators: Price Difference, VOL/OI Ratio, IV**

❗️*Price Difference* ❗️

**You’re looking for orders with price strikes so unreasonable that it raises your eyebrow.** This is your #1 clue for something potentially worthwhile--why are they betting so far out the money? Does this bet diverge from the underlying's normal price movement?  **When my Unusual Whales alert goes off, I’m typically looking for at least 5% out the money,** depending on how close to expiration the call is.  That is not to say there aren’t a bunch of whale plays that are deep in the money or ATM and as valuable if not more— it’s just not my preference.

❗️*VOL/Open Interest Ratio*❗️

This one is very important. ** If Volume is higher than Open Interest it shows you 1: this is very very likely an opening call, not a closing call and 2: High volume/OI shows that the play is UnUsUaL, because the volume on the call option outweighs the amount of interest people have in the position.**  So,the VOL/OI ratio is a pretty good indicator, particularly when the ratio gets into the +1.0 range.  

A high ratio of volume on an order compared the average daily order volume is good, too.  You can check average daily vol on an option using Unusual Whales data on their site, or any number of other platforms. 

💡Volume/OI ratio high=good.  Volume/Daily volume ratio high= good.💡

❗️*Implied Volatility*❗️

So overlooked.  In the rush to be a part of the next boom, we are all guilty of picking up tickers with IV of like 400%.  To find the truly anomalous, **I always begin by looking for IV less than 100%**-- if IV is that low with a high % difference of strike to underlying, this is indicative of a major event coming that is unknown. For this reason I also always make sure it’s not just an earnings play. 

💡 Low IV stonks=nobody sees it coming, high IV stonks=everybody sees it coming💡

[So, what do we get from our DKNG example?  All systems go on those. Good stuff](https://i.imgur.com/EjKiKlH.jpg) 👌🏿 

**2) Urgency Indicators: Days Til Expiration, Volume, Whale order price in comparison to Bid/Ask Spread **

❗️*DTE*❗️

The 🚨 emoji symbol is my favorite sign on Unusual Whales, and is a good general representation of what I'm looking for.  **Although I’m not going to buy a weekly, I really like to see a call dated a few days-two weeks out as a starting point for inspection. ** The closer their order is to expiration, the more I L I K E T H E S T O C K.  This is the first factor I'm looking for while I filter.  If it's a month or more out, I'm probably skipping. Again, plenty of valuable plays further out, it’s just my preference. 

❗️*Volume*❗️

Decent volume implies this move is in a relatively stable ticker, or at least ordered by somebody with a decent amount of money if they buy a ton.  We're looking for big bets, not some WSB kid willing to yolo his $1,400 stimmy because ""EV is the future, bro"".  **We want large bets that indicate confidence and urgency.  Volume is how we get that. **

❗️*Bid/Ask Spread*❗️

This is important in a few ways.  The first is that you want the Bid/Ask spread relatively tight, say within a .10 difference.  If it's tight, it's pretty safe for you to play because you won't get burned when it's time to fill it. 

The second is that if you’re looking at an Unusual options order, the whale’s bid is much more legit if it’s closer to the ask on the bid/ask spread. It signifies aggression and confidence. 

[Is this DKNG pick a buy?  Let’s see](https://i.imgur.com/AWuajpG.jpg). 👌🏿 

Yes. I like the stock. 

***

**So, that’s that.  Hopefully it helped make some things more clear.  A couple other things to remember: **

1.	Buy your expiry a week further out if you’re chasing whales on weeklies

2.	YOU HAVE MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK: usually the play won’t happen til at least the end of the day.  A lot of time I used to rush in thinking I’d miss the news and get hammered for a few hours when I could’ve just waited til EOD.  Stay liquid

3.	Be patient. Luckily every day theres a merger, a new product, an ARKK addition, or whatever the fuck for like 100 different stonks.  Opportunities will come, don’t fall in love with a play you don’t need to make.  Once you start realizing the myriad of things that cause pops, you’ll see the opportunities for them all day long

4.	DO NOT FOLLOW EARNINGS WHALES I LOST $1k ON FEYE THIS WEEK 😭 

**TLDR: You can increase the success of your Unusual Call Activity plays by looking for larger OTM, closer dated plays that have high VOL/Open Interest Ratio and low IV.  If you can, check the bid/ask spread to make sure the whale is opening an aggressive call position, not closing.**

PLEASE PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS. 

My father has about 1.2 million in a hedge fund that has been returning him an average of 15% for 7 years. He says one year they’ll be up 70% the next down 20% the following up 10%. And he says that all his friends plan to withdraw and invest in the overall market that is just. Simply. Safer. 
WHY DOES THIS MATTER ???? 
The funds KNOW of this. 
They have been paying out managers RIDICULOUS bonuses. The owners just wanna cash in and GTFO. 
Again why does this matter. 
Well. Don’t listen to me. THIS IS NOTHING BUT SPECULATION. DO UR OWN RESEARCH. 

There may be hedge funds that use this as an opportunity to absolutely CRAP on their competition. WHY would I invest in Melvin capital when black rock is the one that put a few others out of business (for example).... GET IT????? 

But I think if the short float is anything above 50% come the 4th. THIS IS GOING TO THE FUCKING NEXT GALAXY...

Am I reading this correctly? Short volume is increasing?

Do I understand the concept of Short Volume Ratio correctly? As the ratio goes up> # of shares on the market goes up>$ of share goes down.   
Let me know where I am wrong here. The process of a Hedge Fund short selling more during all of this allows them to reset the call date on their stocks, unless the price goes up in which the shares they borrowed they have to return (original owner wants to sell them?).  Their thinking = Flood market with stock> drive price down> get current share holders turn diamond hands into angelsoft 400> they win by playing long game.

GME Review & short term prediction,13,ldi1fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldi1fi/gme_review_short_term_prediction/,4,1612590043.0,"# Disclaimer

I am not a financial advisor, I am not your financial advisor, I am merely an idiot behind a keyboard with zero stake in the game who has watched the GME situation over the past couple of weeks.

# Hard truths

Anyone who bought in at $300 is an idiot. Sorry if that caused any offence, but it is true. The risk/reward at that buy in is too much in the risk category. If the stock hits $1000, then after taxes you will only increase $350 per share; a mere doubling of value. However it had/has a long way to go to reach that, and it more likely (especially with action taken by the short sellers) to drop from there losing your stake. You are quite literally going ""double or nothing.""

* $1,000 the hope
* $10,000 the dream
* $69,420.69 the meme

Note that those who bought in at sub $50 and were just buying the dips to increase their volume and lock the short sellers out of being able to settle the account are not complete idiots. Provided your average value is still sub $100 then you are still in a good risk/reward area

# Optimistic view

The millions of units which continue to be traded out of hours is a sign to me that the short sellers are driving the share price down by buying/selling low amongst themselves. Driving the price down has two major benefits for them:

* Share value drop will scare off new investors, and open up more opportunity for buying back the oversold stock
* The daily interest payments on $50 are significantly lower than those at $500, which means that they are able to hold on to their shorts for a much longer period of time

# Pessimistic view

The short sellers have closed out their position, and the short squeeze has already happened. Likelihood of this happening is low, considering the volume of trade after hours driving the price down, but we will not know until Tuesday.

# Short term prediction

On Monday the price will continue to drop down to around $30-40 per unit. Tuesday when the short interest is revealed the price will react accordingly. If there is high short interest it will jump again, if it has indeed closed out then the price will continue to fall.

Buying it a small stake at $30-40 on Monday would be a gamble, but it has a much better risk/reward (lose 50% or potentially increase 1,600%)",2021-02-06 07:40:43

to start with their balance sheet:

* $1.1 Billion is cash and investments.
* ZERO long term debt (this is uncommon in the tech growth space, especially the cloud sector) .
* With all this cash on the BS you are technically only paying \~ $7 Billion for a $9 Billion public market value.
* 25 forward PE which is crazy low when you look at the growth potential and compare to competitors premium in the space (most trade in the 100 - 1,000).

Market cap of $9 Billion

DPX is cheaper than when it went IPO

It is undervalued compared to cloud computing competitors.

Hellosign acquisition undervalued compared to competitor of $DOCU which is worth $45 Billion On its own.

$DBX should be trading 4x higher than it is currently based on the premium other investors are paying for competitors in the space

* Large short float (7.4%) meaning squeeze potential as upper long term resistance is tested on volume, Stops will get triggered.
* Relatively low float and market cap meaning it wouldn't take a lot of volume for this stock to trade 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% higher on a day with big news. Low supply of shares with high demand will cause price to go up.
* Not many cash flow positive business have float structures this luctrave.
* They are unlikely to sell new shares to the public if it does gap up as they already have lots of cash on the balance sheet and a cash flow positive business model. **Low risk of share dilution.**
* Closest competitor to Hellosign market cap of $45 Billion
* This is 4x the size of $DBX which is at $9 Billion. Hellosign could grow to the size of $DOCU.
* $DBX has a big potential $DOCU competitor with already great business and growing e-workspace business.
* You are paying a cheaper premium for $DBX and it has more growth potential and is already profitable.
* The selling pressure from $DBX has stopped and insiders and institutions are setting up long positions to play value tech.
* $DBX has begun to break trend and outperform major markets.
* Options activity on the 1 year chain shows a substantial long bias with traders accumulating calls.
* $DBX will gain sympathy from a strong IPO market, cloud computing market, and tech market.
* Investors who missed $DOCU 560% YTD run will look to add $DBX due to the HelloSign acquisition.
* Relative rotation shows capital is flowing out of large cap technology into value tech.
* Institutions have increased their positions by 50,000,000 shares.
* **Institutions own 84% of $DBX**
* A total of 463 institutions hold $DBX and 217 of them have recently added to their holdings.
* There are 60 new holders who recently accumulated a total of 11,675,563 shares during the long term channel on the daily chart.

# Evidence that GME shorts are not covering

### And why we cannot trust short interest data.

***Short interest*** *- the number of shares that have been sold short (sold high to be bought*  *back cheaper later) but have not yet been covered or closed out, is expressed as number of shares, or percentage of the* ***float*** *(tradeable shares of a given instrument).*

It is becoming clearer that short interest data is being inaccurately reported with the hopes of persuading shareholders that there are no shorts to squeeze. Since last Sunday, S3 partners are [deceivingly reporting](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20) that the short interest has dropped 30M by Friday 29th Jan.

An [extremely conservative calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/) for 28th and 29th Jan- considering the most ideal situation for the short-sellers, which doesn’t even take into consideration any volume from retail investors trading between each other, produces these results for the 28th Jan:

* *Shorts added 25M further short positions at an average of $280*
* *While covering 10.4M positions at huge cost.*

This likely did not happen for various reasons, including:

* *We have seen their ability to short-ladder and manipulate the price down. Why would they cover at such huge costs when they know they can wait a few more days to cover for cheaper?*
* *If they did cover, the price would have surged drastically with buy orders and not plummeted as it did through Thu and Fri.*
* *This calculation assumes that 0 volume of trades was executed by retail investors – virtually impossible given the hype at the time.*
* *And lastly, there were very few shares to borrow at the time, only a fraction of the 25M result.*

Now on Friday 29th it was a boring day with a volume of 50M, 17.6M of which were shares being sold short, so SI should be at 57.8M + 17.6M = 75.4M. For SI to have decreased to around 27M as reported by S3 on Sunday, it would have required the covering of 48.4M. Go back and read these numbers again.

### It is impossible to cover 48.4M shares on a day of 50M volume, where 17.6M shares of this 50M were used to add further short positions. Even if every single share that traded on the day went into the pockets of HFs, the SI would still not tally up.

**So how are we getting these numbers?** 

Hedge Funds (HFs) are conducting a [known trick](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) to make it seem like short-sellers are covering their positions. SEC knows about this trick, and [published a memo on the topic back in August 2013](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

Short-sellers create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades. They *write* call options (another short position in the form of a bet/insurance) and sell them to Market Makers (MMs), while buying “synthetic shares” against these options as long positions. Synthetic shares are not a part of the original share float of the stock, and thereby the short-seller appears to have bought shares but they actually haven’t, as they cancel out against the short call positions they wrote and sold.

It’s basically a loophole where both short and long positions are drawn out of thin air, allowing HFs to maintain short positions that legally weren’t supposed to have (140% of float), and in fact the shares never get properly located, which trigger alarms and Failure to Deliver Shares (FTDs) that continue to be pushed forward for consecutive days, now at about 40 straight days.

Now everyone is waiting for the **next SI report on the 9th February**, but I seriously ask you this question: Who is to say that these numbers will not be inaccurate for the exact same reasons that data analysts are reporting?

### The good news is, that with the above evidence you can be sure that SI remains very high to this day, no matter what News channels states about short-sellers closing their positions, and no matter what figures they regurgitate in our faces. We can never know the exact figures for sure, and you can be sure that it is far above what they're reporting, and that there still remains a high volume of shorts that have yet to be squeezed.

**What can you do about this?**

One way to put these HFs in their place is to [call an emergency shareholder vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where every borrowed share needs to be called back to their owners thereby eliminating all synthetic shares. Coupled with a [reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm4sv3c?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) would take away all leverage from fraudulent short-sellers and force the naked shorts to cover immediately.

"Before you decide to write a post about how GME bagholders are done or should sell, come here first",0,ldxkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldxkey/before_you_decide_to_write_a_post_about_how_gme/,0,1612646555.0,"We get it big brain and big gainz dick boy. Squeeze is over. But why should the bagholders sell?

Opened up a position a 300+? Relax. Think about that money as something you won't be touching in the next few years.

The fundamentals and absolute sheer ridiculous marketing GME has benefited from this last few months are a great indicator of how this company has the biggest upside since its birth.

You also think that a billionaire that grew a business from 0 to a 40BN$ cap market FROM FUCKING SELLING DOG FOOD would invest in a company to engage in money laundering? Look at him, he looks like such a doll! You think he'd invest in a dying brick and mortar type of business if he didn't have plans to absolutely turn around the whole company?

Why would excellent Amazon executives join him on the ride?

On top of that, there's also the new revenue shareholding deals with Microsoft, new generation of consoles that just came out, and a brick and mortar structure that can still be used with new perspectives.

The evaluation of GME is still uncertain at this current point in time, but the future tells us this has a bigger growth potential then ever before (excluding the squeeze). Ryan Cohen is a master in e-commerce, and with all of this publicity, GME is and will be now in everyone's mind. Revenues will most likely see a great growth.

So before you decide to make a post to tell everyone how this is completely dead business, go back, put a bean in your ass, sit down and shut the fuck up.

This is not your concern anymore.

To the deep bagholders, if you can, drop your average cost the lowest possible, and maybe in 3 years or so you might recover more than half of your losses. Don't do it now though. Wait for Tuesday, wait until this clears out and see what picture is being drawn regarding GME's future as an e-commerce company.

SOMETHING ALL OF YOU SHOULD READ,22,ldxi9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldxi9c/something_all_of_you_should_read/,10,1612646323.0,"Okay listen here you fucktards! 
First of all, I want to say that I'm not writing this post in order to save my money that i invested in GME, I got 10 shares @88$ avg and I already forgot about that money because I would probably spend it on alcohol or some other stupid shit. I'm giving you a solid DD from economic pshychology point of view. I've finished University of Economics and Business, and am currently in process of getting CFA 3rd degree license. I wrote a scientific paper on the book "" Art of War"" and don't want to reveal my name for security reasons. In the book it says ""Appear the strongest when you are the weakest"" or "" Divide and conquer"" and tons of other stuff that is happening right now and that hedge fonds are actively using to fuck with your minds. I can bet with every one of you that hedge fond managers read that book and hold that book sacred as Christians hold Holy Bible. When did you Americans become so divided? You guys that made couple of thousands of dollars on the peak are acting like Jordan fucking Belforts and giving advices to get out, it's over and shit like that when really when you look at it mathematically it hasn't even started. They literally gave you the bread crumbs and you got out. That is not the spirit of WSB that I know, that I remember. There is one of the biggest financial frauds happening right now and you are letting it happen in front of your fucking eyes? Really nice, but that is not the Americans I know. We, people from all over Europe are looking at you, YOU have the power to stand for your rights and fight. Fuck me, but as far as I know you are the biggest democracy in the whole fucking Earth. Whole world is watching YOU, DO YOUR THING AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS! YOU DON'T WANT BREAD CRUMBS, YOU WANT YOUR RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD TO GET! NOW IS THE TIME!

Murakami Corp,8,ldxegk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldxegk/murakami_corp/,1,1612645902.0,"Hey. Just saw the tweet of Dr. Michael J. Burry about how maybe we live in a time where the ironcoffinlid could finally come off. He recommended the stock Murakami Corp which is a company that produces rear-view mirrors and automobile cameras and stuff like that. Now the Thing is that this Company has more cash on hand (37bn¥) than their market cap (33,4bn¥) is. So as far as I can tell basically all net income is free for stock holders? And as the interest for the Japanese economy is gonna rise (coffinlid comming off) the potential gains must be huge. Can anybody tell me if im correct or just being stupid and missing something?

As everybody knows, it dropped pretty hard. My account lost 90% in value, but I never sold. Today I'm 40% in gains. I've learned my lesson and will use my experience to deal with GME. I will not sell with high loss. I will average the price over time and follow their development, with the new board and new cashflow they gained in the last weeks.

I don't know if I ever will be up in the gains but what I do know is the following:

Decisions need to be made and you need to stick to them. Deal with them, educate yourself and make new decisions. Don't let any emotions or shittalk make you buy or sell shares from now on! Many of my friends sold their coins after the big drop, with a huge loss. They told me to do the same, but I believed in a decentralized system and still do.Luckily I could cover all my GME losses and still have gain (but I'm still holding the coins and the GME shares). I think that over time things will change. This hype not only changed WallStreet and the way hedge funds from now on will infiltrate threads and discord groups. No, it also changed the way people see GameStop. For many it was just a Pump&Dump. For other people it meant fighting the wallstreet and for the rest it meant to support GME.

This wave of support (even the Pump&Dump) will change Gamestop forever and it could become something completely new. I'm not giving up on GME or on my money. I can hold longer, than they can play with the GME shares. The moment GME changes their business model everybody will change the trading strategy. And who knows, maybe I'll be break even someday.

I don't know how big GME could become or if it will fail. But I know, that I'm going to find out...

&#x200B;

Edit: I bought GME 69@240

Edit 2: I'm not comparing Coins to GME. I'm explaining my decision process. I made a decision in 2018 and I'm making one now. I'm not selling because of a drop or because people spread shit about GME. From now on I'll only sell if GME is not improving...",2021-02-06 22:47:32

KURSRAUSCH BEI GAMESTOP:Robinhood verkauft Daten der Kleinanleger an Hedgefonds

Mit Robinhood wollten es die Kleinanleger mit der Wallstreet aufnehmen. Doch die Broker-App macht Geschäfte mit den Hedgefonds und gibt die Nutzerdaten weiter. Beide scheffeln so Milliarden.

￼

Beim Angriff auf die Hedgefonds nutzten Massen von Kleinanlegern die Broker-App Robinhood.

￼

Damit trieben sie etwa den Aktienkurs des US-Computerspielhändlers Gamestop in die Höhe.



Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.

Darum gehts

Mit der Broker-App Robinhood trieben Kleinanleger den Aktienkurs von Gamestop in die Höhe.

Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger im Kampf gegen die Wallstreet zu sein.

Doch es ist genau umgekehrt: Die App verkauft ihre Nutzerdaten an Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändler.

Dabei fliessen auf beiden Seiten Milliarden.

Es hätte David gegen Goliath sein sollen: Kleinanleger versammelten sich kürzlich in Scharen auf der Plattform Reddit, um zum grossen Angriff auf die grossen Hedgefonds zu blasen. Im Kollektiv kauften sie Aktien von maroden Firmen, um den Kurs nach oben zu treiben. Damit wollten die Anleger den grossen Investmentfirmen schaden, die mit sogenannten Leerverkäufen (siehe Box) auf sinkende Kurse setzen und damit Unsummen mit taumelnden Firmen verdienen.

Im Fokus dieses von Kleinanlegern angezettelten Flashmobs standen die Aktien des US-Comuterspielhändlers Gamestop oder der US-Kinokette AMC. Tatsächlich schossen jene Kurse innert Kürze in die Höhe und bescherten Hedgefonds Verluste in Milliardenhöhe.

So funktionieren Leerverkäufe

Ein Leerverkäufer, auch Short-Seller genannt, leiht sich Aktien und verkauft sie umgehend. Er hofft, dass der Kurs fällt und er die Papiere zu einem tieferen Preis zurückkaufen kann. Das ist nicht unumstritten, wie Matthias Geissbühler, Investment-Chef von Raiffeisen Schweiz, zu 20 Minuten sagt. So könnten dadurch Abwärtstrends verstärkt und einzelne Firmen kaputt gemacht werden. Genau das befürchteten wohl die Gamestop-Fans.

Hedgefonds kassieren ab

Doch was auf den ersten Blick wie ein Sieg für die Kleinanleger ausschaut, ist in Wahrheit genau das Gegenteil. Zum einen sitzen nun viele Anleger und Spekulanten auf riesigen Verlusten. Denn mittlerweile ist die Aktienjagd fast vorbei und die Kurse sind teils wieder drastisch zusammengesackt. Zum anderen haben gerade die Hedgefonds mit dem vermeintlichen Angriff auf sie ebenfalls abkassiert.

Grund dafür ist die Broker-App Robinhood. Das Tool nutzten viele Reddit-User, um mit Aktien wie Gamestop und AMC zu handeln und den Angriff auf die Hedgefonds zu planen. Die Transaktionen sind mit der App gratis, da keine Gebühren verlangt werden. Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger gegen die Mächtigen der Wallstreet zu sein. Doch auch hier zeigt sich: Es ist gerade umgekehrt, wie der «Tages-Anzeiger» schreibt.

Robinhood verkauft Nutzerdaten

Denn auch Robinhood muss Geld verdienen. Und das tut die App gerade mit den Hedgefonds sowie computerbasierten Hochfrequenz-Händlern – und damit mit den Feindbildern der Kleinanleger. So knöpft Robinhood den Kleinanlegern zwar keine Gebühren ab, dafür aber deren Nutzerdaten. Diese verkauft sie den Hedgefonds.

Die App gibt den grossen Investoren so Einblick in die Handelsaufträge der Kleinkunden, bevor der Auftrag abgewickelt ist. «Damit können diese professionellen Händler blitzschnell die Differenzen zwischen den Kauf- und Verkaufspreisen ausnutzen und Milliardengewinne machen», schreibt die Zeitung weiter.

Busse von 65 Millionen Dollar

Das Geschäft mit den Kundendaten soll die grösste Einnahmequelle für die App sein. Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.

This hedgefund situation can last for days/week/maybe months. But I will still hold regardless because I know it will skyrocket in the future. The amount of loss you would gain is just not worth it at all.

Though I also do understand people who have put their life savings and they do need to pay their bills so they dipped out, that is completely fine. Prioritize your own living condition but at least don't risk your own well being being the market can be violent sometimes.

Your desperate low effort post/karma farming is cringe and does not inspire any confidence. It reeks of weakness and uncertainty. It's also the reason for the ""GME"" fatigue.

Some brokers have blocked this facility, so while they haven't stopped you trading on shares they are handing them to Melvin in the background. So even if you are a 💎🙌 legend you are helping Melvin.

Why GME is still getting catapulted to Alpha Centauri 🚀🚀🚀🚀,560,ldoq4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldoq4h/why_gme_is_still_getting_catapulted_to_alpha/,107,1612610436.0,"Alright retards, I can barely read and I know the literacy rate of Zimbabwe is better than the literacy rate on this sub so I'll try to keep it simple. I truly believe GME is going to alpha fucking centauri and you should too for the following reasons 🚀🚀

1. DFV is still holding. Need I say more? Unlike most of the retards on here with a college degree who can barely use it (including myself), DFV actually has credentials and studied this play to the T. How do I know? Go look at his history post. When we were pissing and laughing at the dude, he was compiling the thesis that would go down in WSB and stock history. Im a retard who trusts a geologist about rocks, why would I doubt DFV about GME? Hell, Id trust a dude with a cat infatuation over Cramer any day of the fucking week.
2. The shills. It's clear as day that our beloved republic is infiltrated by bots. These hedgies are unleashing their filth. How do you collapse an enemy? You weaken it from within. All this shit being flung from bot accounts is psychological warfare to incite paper hands. Why? They want you to sell at a loss or a measly profit so the hedgies dont get fucked nearly as hard. If the Squeeze did Squoze and the worse for the hedgies was over, why would they keep getting their bots to spread bullshit?
3. Papa Cohen. You read that right. Papa Cohen followed RoaringKitty on Twitter and unfollowed. I dont blame Papa Cohen for doing such. RC doesnt follow that much people on twitter to start with and doesnt want the hedgies crying market manipulation (ironic as that is). This is the same RC that tweeted a roller coaster and had to have it taken down cause his lawyers were strict. Fuck, I bet Papa Cohen is plotting to blow out the shorts as we speak and cant contain his excitement. RC following DFV briefly acknowledges that RC lurks on here. He's like a kid the night before Christmas whose over the fucking moon but cant open his presents, lest his parents give him shit.
4. Need rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
5. Market manipulation. Last week, it took GROSS market manipulation in BROAD daylight to stall the rocket to Valhalla. Vlad proved he's a crony and a stooge to hedgefunds. RH will pay because of it. They already have. All this did was STALL how bad the hedgies will get fucked. It didnt stop it. Those fucks are just on borrowed time.
6. Ever since the peanut prophecy from our beloved Papa Cohen, he's been dead silent. He had nothing to do with the rally from 40-450$. A short squeeze to squoze needs a catalyst, we almost had it ignited last week but it took a corrupt fucking market to tank it. WAIT for the catalyst, we dont know who or what itll be but we just know itll eventually happen. Papa Cohen is the Messiah about to annihilate the anti-christ, were his trusted army of retards. He'll never let us down just as we swore loyalty to him and his mission to Alpha Centauri 🚀🚀🚀
7. Fuck the hedgies. I have no problem holding my shares, taking them to the grave, and letting my great-great grandchildren inherit them. For all I know, maybe theyll be worth millions by then. Ill take my chances with GME to beat inflation for the sake of my future offspring. Cohen turned CHEWY into a success, I have no doubt he'll do the same with GME regardless
8. All these dirty tactics were made to get you to SELL. RH and other brokers banned buying and didnt allow selling. Did you wonder why that is? If the hedges were covering as that was happening, why did the price keep dropping if the hedgies were buying to cover?  Anybody who sells at this point for a loss or a measly profit is more primitive than a retard
9. Its not that hard to hold shares and do nothing. Imagine youre the boomer who bought apple in the 80s and forgot about it. Lo and Hold youre the boomer who couldve been sitting on a gold mine and never acknowledged it till years after.

So on Monday this week I entrusted someone with a managing an account. (I know exactly what your thinking, ""Why would you do that lmao"")

So basically I run my own account but still go out and work etc at the same time and I wanted to have another ""Managed account"" running in the background that would work as a supplementary to my income if I was ever working or wanted to take a week off.

I entrusted Feral Forex with it as from everything I'd seen being a part of his signals groups and having his quite well done guide he seemed trustworthy. And due to the nature of my account, he couldn't withdraw any money, only trade with it and me send him his split. What could go wrong?


This guy puts 3 0.5 lots on gold longs, on a £2000 account with 1:500 leverage... The account was pretty much blown by him within 6 hours....

After asking why the hell it happened his only retort was ""I didn't expect gold to drop so quickly"" and then saying he doesn't cover losses after I say look ok these things happen, if you send me the money that was lost I'll put it back in the account and we can start again from there that way you'll also get your money back.

He then chose to ignore me and block me after I call him out for what he did on his Instagram posts.

I know you probably will all think I'm dumb and yeah you're right I feel pretty dumb for putting so much trust into someone...

For Your Reading Pleasure: An Autist Loss Story,13,ldicig,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldicig/for_your_reading_pleasure_an_autist_loss_story/,14,1612590902.0,"Ready for this... SUPER AUTIST MOMENT INCOMING:

Had two GME $115 calls 1/29. Sold one for 20k midday Friday and held the other til 3:58. As I go to sell in etrade power on my computer (in portfolio view), it times me out for inactivity before I could sell before expiration. I had been clicking around so not sure why. I immediately sign back in and go to sell the last one I had. I hit trade from my portfolio and send submit the order. I am amped that I got another 25k more at the end of the day....

Well, to my surprise, when you open a trade order FROM YOUR FUCKING PORTFOLIO it automatically goes to BUY instead of SELL. (WHY THE FUCK DOES IT FUNCTION LIKE THAT IN PORTFOLIO VIEW WHEN I CAN OPEN A QUOTE FOR A BUY) Therefore, I ended up BUYING a second $115c 1/29 with 30 seconds left in the market. Immediately after I noticed, I was on the phone with etrade for 3 hours on Friday while having a panic attack. They said they won't know what happens til Monday. I look Monday and they exercise the calls for way above market value (217ish a share). Its Monday morning and now own 240 shares.

At this point, my etrade account says my cash is -$20k (owed to etrade via margin). I go to sell at market open to make up that 20k and hold the rest but it says if I sold those newly acquired shares, I'd get a 90 day ban since those shares/cash hasn't processed yet. Since I don't want to get locked out of my account for three months, I have to sit on those shares until Tuesday. Get an email Tuesday morning saying the money is due TUESDAY!

Well, as you know, it drops almost $200 a share into Tuesday and I essentially sold for a loss at $120 a share. I still have 60 shares left over and they are certainly not doing well either. Would have loved to use the money to tip some of my favorite local businesses a grand here and there but instead, just gonna stuff my face with comfort food.

Thats it boys, let me have it. Still holding my 60 with diamond hands because 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TLDR - Waited for last second Friday to sell my 1/29 $115 call. E Trade logs me out for inactivity. Log back in with 30 seconds left, think I SOLD my call. Turns out E Trade auto populates a trade as a BUY. They exercise with margin -20k. Won't let me sell without 90 day ban Monday. Wake up to email saying I owe them the money Tuesday. Have to sell at $120ish.. Could of had $50k, have nothing.",2021-02-06 07:55:02

IS EVERYONE HERE LITERALLY A RETARD?? HOW CAN YOU GUYS NOT SEE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO US??,44,ldplrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldplrp/is_everyone_here_literally_a_retard_how_can_you/,76,1612613572.0,"I don’t know if i’m missing something, but I really think people have allowed the novel opportunities of this unique situation to go completely unnoticed thus far. 

First, I’m going to make a big assumptions that I think is reasonable, and while it may not be what some people want to hear, I will aslo explain why i believe it is also nothing to fear (Lol that rhymed). 

The squeeze has been squoze. I’m sorry to say it, but a 1600% in less than almost 3 months is unprecedented. The price rose because the shorts covered. It’s really that simple. It perhaps could have gone higher but as we all know ridiculous margins were used to halt buying from brokers, and the momentum was killed - which allowed them to use naked shorts to lower the price so that they could cover at a smaller loss and also limit what retail investors could gain. 

BUT-  this isn’t all doom and gloom. Even if they covered on the short positions the interest ratio isn’t magically 0, and the short interest percentage isn’t suddenly 0%. These institutions probably saw the peak of $480 and from there on instantly started shorting again for those easy dollars (bearing in mind not one single institution shorted $GME 140% alone, and not every single institution has placed a short position in unity). No one has seen a squeeze happen twice in succession in history before right? A safe bet. Or is it?  

For one, I think it’s fairly obvious that certain institutions have been selling naked shorts (OTHERWISE CALLED *’STRATEGIC FAILURES TO DELIVER’*) throughout this process for damage control purposes - but I truly believe all it has done is reset the timer on an even larger and scarier time bomb. Naked shorting is definitely an illegal activity, but unfortunately it was grandfathered by the SEC, which has allowed it to remain a popular strategy for institutions to use to lower the prices of stocks that they are short against.

If this is true (which I honestly think is most likely), this means that more shorts we’re created in the process of covering these short positions. Think about it. A ~140% short interest percentage is unprecedented. Insane margins that prevent buying due to 0 liquidity are extremely rare. 

THERE WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN THAT MANY SHARES AVAILABLE TO *TRULY* COVER ANYWAY. 

That’s a STEEEP crash from $480. Do you really think everyone simultaneously chose to sell at $480 once buying was prevented? There are a LOT of what you guys call ‘bag holders’ (I say 💎🙏) which is pretty evident from the state of a lot of subs. I think the hype was real and a lot of people held - not to mention that people were also actively buying large amounts of stock throughout the run-up to the peak, increasing the amount of people trying to get their hands on these shares that were needed to cover, and thus causing the artificial amount of shares in circulation to increase. 

In essence, how many I-O-Us were generated in the process of covering would have drastically increased due to the buying pressure leading up to the moment brokers were prevented from allowing RIs to purchase more stocks. Remember: the amount of stocks they needed to short was LARGER than the amount of outstanding shares by 44% so they could have only immediately covered just over 2/3 of what they needed to cover without creating more I-O-Us in the process (granted people weren’t paper-handing in large enough quantities just quite yet).  

This is what I think is the true reason as to why buying had to be halted from their perspective. Before buying was halted EVERYONE was in solidarity with holding, so the price drops we see during these periods where buying was prevented must have come from these aforementioned naked shorts - to give those paperhands the nudge they needed to sell, so that they could eventually cover their positions without creating more of those FTDs. THIS is the stage that we are currently at right now. 

EVERYONE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE BAG MEANS THAT IT DOESN’T MATTER WHETHER THEY COVER OR NOT.

Everytime an FTD occurs, someone’s stock goes missing. Essentially, someone that decides to purchase one of these stocks (or someone that already owns the stock) now has to receive an I-O-U instead of the stock itself. This creates artificial supply. Essentially, there are more positions open than there are stocks available to cover, so even when they have covered their shares, they still need to buy more. Their demand for shares hasn’t decreased until they can close literally all of their short positions because if they want to cover all of them they have to create more FTDs, since the shares they need to buy don’t exist.

This is the gist that I’m getting at. Holding during this stage is paramount, but buying even more so. The more buying that happens during this stage, the more I-O-Us that need to be created by brokers, since they themselves can never get the opportunity to get their hands on shares that haven’t been artifically created to meet the supply of the crazy demand that they imposed on themselves.

The more I-O-Us they create, the debt of shares they eventually have to buy back to cover increases. Its pretty much directly correlated to the short interest. It also increases how much it costs to short the stock, and thus how much the insitutions bleed before they’re eventually forced to cover their positions. 

From these assumptions and speculation, it is clear to me that any short holders have set themselves up to be squeezed over and over again so long as they continue to short the stock whilst FTD’s remain to occur and retards are willing to buy. It’s like a perfect counter to absurd shorting. 

If this theory holds true, to completely simplify it: as long as [Percentage of shares held] + [Percentage of shares shorted] = >100% for long enough + additional buy pressure = SUPER DEMAND for stocks as every new buyer creates a new I-O-U that needs to be covered for later. 

Ill sinplify it even more for you: 

More hold, more buy at dip, 

Furthermore, I think it’s fairly reasonable to suggest that other institutions recognised that the shorts were covering and also wanted to short that ~$480 price tag, so the short interest might not be too far off what It once was come the 9th Feb. 

Now that I even think about it, as long as there are large amounts of FTDs with simulatenous large amounts of buying, I don’t see why we even require a large amount of short interest. If we keep generating I-O-Us then the cost of the short positions increases, which again increases demand for stock, and thus increases the price further. Essentially, you can make them cover by forcing them to spend an absurd amount of money trying to generate the counterfeit stock they require to plug the whole thing (the so called ‘strategic fails to deliver’).

In other words: Our high volume of buying during periods of high FTD occurence causes liquidty to run out for brokers. This forces shorts pay higher interest. This puts pressure on covering. This drives demand and increases the price. This gets you tendies. 

This is literally how they get away with driving a stock to bankruptcy and no one notices where all of the counterfeited shares went - they just do the opposite. If they can manage to drop the price low enough, the I-O-Us are cheap enough to where they can pay for all the shares that they owe and discard them - because its nothing in light of the fact that they made a healthy sum off of shorting the stock in the first place. But we can be the driving force that flips this process on its head. We can use their ‘strategic’ failures to deliver against them. 

I’m sorry if there are some things that don’t hold up to scrutiny but this all makes perfect sense from my limited understanding.

I just think that this has been a unique moment in financial history. We find ourselves in different circumstances than the past, and we are now able to achieve greater things if we are organized. 

Also, i’m really sorry. I’m on mobile, and I was not expecting to make this post this long. I look forward to hearing how viable people think this theory is.

"Honest question, how was dropping the price supposed to convince us to sell?",20,ldm2y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldm2y7/honest_question_how_was_dropping_the_price/,38,1612601741.0,"Full disclosure, I'm just a retard who only got into trading because I fucking love the stock so my understanding of the market ain't perfect

I got in @300 so I saw a 30% ""loss"" the first day which became a 75% one the second day, now this may be the first time I throw money in the stock market but I've been a gambler most of my life and there is no way I would cut my losses when I have already ""lost"" almost everything 

Literally my only instict was to double down and buy more and the only reason I didn't is because revolut had at this point blocked buying GME and AMC

If I think it through dropping the price so low while I had bought so much higher is the single best way to convince me to buy more, I would never accept such a big loss so the only option is to hold and wait until the price goes to the moon and if my only option is to wait for the price to go up it's only logical to buy more while it's low so I'll make a much bigger profit in the end 

I may be missing something because I'm an ape but from my point of view the hedges and whoever is advising them on ~~human~~ ape psychology are fucking retarded, the only one more retarded than them are the people actually selling 

Now if you'll excuse me I have to go sell my kidneys so I can panic buy at open on Monday 🚀🚀🚀🌕

Now that we have 8.6 million degens here it’s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO,43,ldiwpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldiwpp/now_that_we_have_86_million_degens_here_its_time/,31,1612592431.0,"Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. 

My bull case....🚀🚀

EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.

Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.

That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.

Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. 

Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries. 

They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.

NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. 

Cameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.

1. How is he supposed to exit at his break even if he can't set a sale price high enough? Obviously he wanted profits but he can't even set a profitable limit sell on GME. 


2. Why in the fuck can be not sell at whatever price he wants??


3. Are there any big boy brokers that let you set whatever limit order you want?


4. Why does it burn when I pee?

Got paid today and bought five more. Because I like the stock.

These shares will one day sell for no less than four figures a piece, whether by me or by my future grandchildren avenging me with the next squeeze in 2099. Never surrender.

PS. let's please stop setting stupid ass deadlines for when we think this is going to pop off. I've seen ""TOMORROW IS DEFINITELY THE DAY"" posted every single day since last Thursday. These posts have been correct 0/6 times. Stop it. Tomorrow (well, Monday) is NOT ""definitely the day,"" and all you're doing is playing with people's expectations and emotions, while the weaker among us become more likely to turn into paper-handed scabs because they feel deceived and disheartened. This is either going to happen or it won't, and we don't know when exactly it will trigger. We don't actually fucking know anything, we can barely read. So keep it simple: just hold your damn shares until we're all either rich or dead. Be patient. Let go of your fear of bagholding. Become one with the bag. It's not that bad - I'm still carrying my ACB shares from fucking 2013. If you lose money here, it may be your first time, but it won't be your last unless you're a giant bitch. You'll live. And you'll make money on other trades. Maybe.

PSPS. Stop screaming ""mArkEt mAniPuLaTioN"" every time something happens that you don't understand, like AMC/GME trading as a basket (which is largely caused by a phenomenon called ""apes buy the same stock, apes sell the same stock, algorithms catch on and daytrade accordingly""). You sound like the prehistoric retards who thought thunderstorms meant God was mad at us because somebody fucked a goat.

some serious ones.

I know you say you can't read, but here it goes.

The last few weeks has been... lets say interesting.

Some of you mfers won it all, and some of you retards are left holding nothing but body bags.

Some made their first trade ever, got screwed real good, scared and pulled out of this world forever.

Others got bit by the bug and will try new moves to gamble away their fortune.

Some of you got out just in time with enough $ for a lifetime, and some will never recover.

That's how this game is. There is no mercy. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

Some played it well, some got carried away.

WSB is all about lossporn, fantastic memes, ballsy hits and the occational riches, so all is good.

And a big fucking thank you to the mods!



But some of you apes, are just to good to be true.

Please,  buy GME, AMC and all other memestocks as much as you want, please spend  your entire savings, please borrow money from your mothers boyfriend, extend your mortgage, sell your dog, Toyota Corolla  or your mouth on the corner below a GMEposter on the side of the  road for more stocks. Good for you!

But we dont care.

And that is the point.

Its time to move shop.

Move  far away with your HoLDiN TiLL I'm Dead, BuY The DIps, short ladder,  screw HF, and the other new words you learned a week ago.

Please bring your rockets with you, shuw them up your asses and fly to the fucking moon where the god damn gorillas can fist you dry. Good for you!

As  far as WSB are concerned, this run is over. It was fun and it was the  greatest play there has ever been, but for us, it is over.

There are dedicated subs for you gaping assholes. I can suggest [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), [r/AMCstock](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCstock/) or even [r/Bondage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bondage/).

You have become the Drunk uncle at thanksgiving rambling away,

It was fun for a while, a truly hilarious ride, but the party is over. Its time to go!

We get it, you love the stock, but now it is time to make sweet, sweet love to the stock somewhere else!

We want our sub back, and you are no longer invited unless you listen more, and talk less.

It prints money. Just picture it. It's almost like the KF Console was built for this moment, they just didn't realize it yet.

You walk into a GameStop and you ask the clerk, ""Sir, I would like the Console which allows me to cook Chicken Tendies while I play vidya games"".

""Oh ho, ho, another chicken lover I see. Well step right over here, we have just one Tendie Machine left.""

Your eyes begin to water, you're almost crying.

""Hold on, let me grab it from the back"" the GameStop employee says.

Your heart begins to beat faster and faster. Could it truly be that you will get a Tendie Machine today? Will you really be able to take it home and cook the chicken tenders that your mom bought you for your birthday? Will you finally get what your heart has secretly been desiring before you even *heard* of the Tendie Machine?

The GameStop Employee comes back. He's holding the last Tendie Machine in the entire store. Your eyes well up with tears. It's beautiful. It cooks chicken and plays videogames **at the same time**. 

""Don't worry"" he says, ""it's all yours."" You start to cry in the middle of the store, your dream is finally coming true. You pay for your Tendie Machine and take it home. Everyone in the store gives you a standing ovation. You see others who just arrived to claim a Tendie Machine with tears in their eyes as they know in their hearts the last Tendie Machine in the store is all yours. Your dream of cooking chicken while playing videogames at the same time has finally come true. Your life is finally complete.",2021-02-06 09:07:28
"Interesting tought my law professor had about the ""news"" about Silver, Plutonium and whatever stocks ""WSB is squeezing"".",28,ldx5kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldx5kq/interesting_tought_my_law_professor_had_about_the/,35,1612644950.0,"He was giving a class about economics abroad (we're not from the US) and talked about the weird way stocks work abroad... as a reference point, in most other countries it seems the stocks have a fixated value that the company puts themselves, but it's backed up on the actual worth of the company and the stocks give the claim to the net earnings divied between the number of actions a company has.

When compared to the US, basically the stocks are worth, not on the real value, but the perceived value, making it a lot more... random... as people can that a company is ""going to make a lot of money"" and the stocks will increase in value, just because a lot of people are going to try to buy them, even if there is no real evidence they are actually gonna make a lot of money... EXCEPT NEWS ARTICLES CALLING IT OUT.

But that was not the real gist of the speech as, from what he said, the US system is showing that, not only their way of working is flawed, but, that everyone and anyone in a group, where they can amass a great deal of money, can actually take advantage of those flaws, and make as much money as those ""Wolfs of Wallstreet"" have been making for decades without any real repercussion.

That is very dangerous, as the elites were using that capital to increase their wealth, and attacking that system might make billions of dollars go away from the pockets of that .1%, to the rest of the population... And here is the real point of the news articles.

The point of effect of the news articles relating ""Minerals"" to this sub might not be related to confusing people in this sub to sell or buy random stocks, but to actually confuse people that don't really understand what reddit is, to regulate the way stocks can actually be bought or sold by making them believe they can actually change the value of anything and therefore, shouldn't be allowed to do so.

To explain this, let's say there is a new regulation and there is a single fee of... 1-5 dollars behind a personal process and a goverment building you have to visit to actually get the permit... How many people would actually get around the trouble of going to that building... and how many organizations of people would do the same altogether to start investing in stocks?

The number would decrease exponentially as, even if you can invest the money, not that many people will go trough the trouble of actually getting that permit and definitely it would make it harder for companies like Robin Hood or whatever, to work, since they would have to check that permit existing.

That would make the elites keep making billions every day, while making the regular people not be able to invest in large groups without a real issue like it's working right now.

Ok, for real, this is all conjecture and there might be some other random reason behind it and this was all said by a random guy of a foreign country so maybe he can be very mistaken so don't take it as anything more than that.",2021-02-06 22:55:50

Stop losses were also not an option because again the dip from 420 to 126 and back to 300s showed that wasn’t an option either.

New Zom Product Explained for you Retards,43,ldli8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldli8b/new_zom_product_explained_for_you_retards/,31,1612599936.0,"Hello fellow retards. Ive seen some people confused or asking about the new ZOM product being released in march. I am a biomedical engineering student on a pre medicine track. I am in a military-medicine pipeline program, where when I graduated I will be a retarded medical student in our military. I have done lots of research with gastrointestinal assays (basically stomach/intestine test). So, I might be a retard, but I know what all this shit means.

So what the fuck is zom. Zomedical corp (ZOM) is a veterinarian pharmaceutical supply company. They are coming out with a product called TruForma. Truforma is a new way for veterinarians to test your dogs and cats for different cancers and diseases with out having to ship the results to a lab. Its a new platform where everything is done in-house (also known as the Point of Care). It uses something called BAW (bulk audio waves) that are really fucking precise. Speeds up treatment times, allows for vets to make a profit, less visits for pet owners. This product will hit the market mid-late march

Edit: I can’t believe I have to address this, but no I am no in any way affiliated with zomedica, nor do I want to be. I am just a premed student who’s really fucking retarded and joined this sub Reddit. If you have any questions specifically about the product I can do my best to explain but there’s 70 patents. 

Edit 2: Jesus Christ guys If you want the specifics of the test I’ll gladly go over them. The test helps identify abnormal levels of adrenal and thyroid hormones which can help find different diseases and cancers of theses areas. It does this by having analytes like thyroxine, ash, t4, adrenaline, etc. bind to certain target molecules (these specific molecules have not been released to me) causing them to resonated at different frequencies when the BAW waves move through them. This allows the sensors (I do not have the knowledge of how these work) to pick them up separately from the other particles. You’re not cool by making me prove to you I’m a premed student by saying “I gotcha” and having me name a bunch of different hormones. I’m not pushing a fucking stock. I don’t care about it. I think it’s a cool product and I know it’s nice to have someone explain it to you since you all have explained things to me. 

\*\*I am not a financial advisor, I am just a retard talking about science shit, explaining why people are buying ZOM. Please do not take anything I am saying as financial advise, I am just trying to say what the product is. This is no indication whether or not you should buy ZOM, that is your own decision. Also this is not saying that zom will moon or not. I have no idea what I’m talking about when I talk about stonks.\*\*",2021-02-06 10:25:36
The Market and Bots. An Enemy or a Friend ?,6,ldl9fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldl9fx/the_market_and_bots_an_enemy_or_a_friend/,9,1612599215.0,"Hello to every retard in this sub, DONT BE SPOOKED BY THE TITLE. I've noticed the past few days a lot of stuff mentioned about bots and how they are affecting the market prices, To be specific many refer to them as illegal actions. However bots are not illegal in most of the world's markets . Lets Focus on GME and AMC which are the main reasons people are concerned. There are many things happening on both of these stocks for sure, despite that fact lets be cautious, when we mention the world illegal. Bots are being used by both sides. We are using them in order to buy our stocks and sell them at specific prices and so are ''they'' (''they'' referring to the big companies such as JPM) more or less to control the price in their favor. There have been many cases where there have been manipulation concerns, but somehow the ones that commit the acts leading to that, always have their asses covered. Its important to understand though, that the fact ,that the graphs look alike, may not be only due to manipulation, but due to the fact that the investors , are more or less the same. That means that the bots they are using directly or indirectly ,meaning the ones provided by companies such as one's that RH, Capital etc. are 'using', are making the calls at the same time frame due to the way they have been programmed to work. So now on to the companies that are using them in a different way. These companies such as Citadel and JPM are trading between one another in order to drive the price where they want since they both participate in the hedge-fund. I understand this causes a misconception, that this is illegal but it's not. Its unethical, since many people may be feared into changing their mind, and there have been many people trying to change the regulations. However since bots are the ones determining the price of a stock, it can ''be tricked into ""believing"" that the price is lower than the actual one"". This has happened in the past and I will link an article which includes the instance which took place back in 2012 as far as I recall. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying nothing illegal is taking place, I just can't prove it. What I want you to pay attention to are the regulations these companies also have on bot trading or automated trading :

* New definitions for algorithmic traders
* Obligatory exchange controls for self-match prevention
* Registration criteria for direct connectivity to US-based FCMs and exchanges
* Pre-trade risk controls, including both cancellation systems and execution limits
* Compulsory testing environments and algorithm source code stores for automated trading systems

I want to underline that the issue might be on the 3rd regulation, and that's where illegal activity might be taking place, if anyone finds proof about that we need to do something about this. In addition to the previously mentioned, SEC is not a regulator of automated trading so any issues must be forwarded to either one of these :

* **US National Futures Association** – Many USA day trading regulations stem from the NFA. Their aim to protect consumers while safeguarding the integrity of the markets.
* **US Commodity Futures Trading Commission** – This agency is independent of the US government and oversees all FX brokers in the US. This body actively prosecutes companies who engage in fraudulent activity in the forex market.
* **FINRA** – The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a private corporation that conducts its activities as a self-regulated organization. They are primarily concerned with regulating stocks in the US. This is the body that imposes pattern day trading regulations.
* **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** – Created in 1974, this independent agency of the US government regulates futures and options markets. As detailed above, the CFTC also plays a role in algorithmic trading regulations.

A case for GME long: Build-A-PC,10,ldko61,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldko61/a_case_for_gme_long_buildapc/,18,1612597426.0,"I’m GME long, and if you must know why I’m confident in the company: it’s build a pc kiosks. 

The console cycle has been getting longer and longer and it’s up to 8 years now. 4 years into the cycle (and that’s conservative l) budget gaming PCs at a price point of ~500 are going to be even with the current gen consoles, and outstrip them after that. Build-a-pc kiosks provide an outlet for console gamers to get into pc gaming. GameStop powerup can be used as a vehicle to provide incredible discounts to build-a-pc customers that hook them before they have a chance to look at steam. 

The console gaming market is 10x the pc gaming market. If they convert 10% of console gamers they’ll have a larger proportion of the market than steam. And they have 8 years to do it. They have a partnership with Microsoft meaning users probably get a great discount on windows, which if you’ve ever built a budget gaming pc is 20% of the cost. They can set up their own relationships with hardware distributors to get around scalpers (incentive for people who build PCs) and to get bulk discounts on hardware. Combine that with a willingness to sell at a loss like consoles do, and they could probably be at console parity in a year if not right now.

They don’t need to compete with steam, that’s retarded. They’re competing with _consoles_. Hard now early into the cycle (which they profit immensely from I might add) but the longer and longer this cycle lasts the easier and easier it will be. 

4 years from now, if they have captured just 10% of the console market, at its current value that’s a revenue of 6 billion, not even counting the revenue from actually building the damn PCs. If you count the growth of the gaming market, it’s probably closer to 10. If they don’t manage to retain a single customer with their existing model, and only manage to capture  10% of the console market, that gives them a share price of 150 at a P/S ratio of 1 (low end for S&P500). If RC does for pc gaming what he did for dog food, 10% is very conservative. He just threw down 170 million dollars to bet on it.

The one question, and the only question is: can Ryan fucking Cohen find a way to market pc gaming to console gamers 4 years into the console cycle when the next gen is still 4 years away.

So, it comes down to: do you think RC can do it? I do. So I’m GME long. If you don’t think he can, or if you think console gamers will still be fucking the cooling vents of their consoles with their micropeens 4 years from now, then you’re not.

First consider what it takes to become a financial titan. A massive hedge fund manager? These people are winners. They win, no matter what. They DO NOT LOSE like you paper handed soft bitches. They will do whatever it takes to win.


They have a history of winning, a pedigree of destruction in the markets if you will. Gains upon gains upon gains. Like your wife's, boyfriend. 


Now for you to believe these HF's covered is for you to believe that these egomaniac financial chads who are banging all your wives while you close a night shift at wendy's, it's believing they accepted defeat. Do you really believe these HF's woke up last week and said. 


""Oh shit, the retarded kids on the internet beat us. Time to cover and take a -5000% loss.""


ABSOLUTELY NOT. These fuckers woke up and the winner inside them was awoken. They called meetings, did deals, and called their overseas mistresses and figured out how to wiggle and squirm out of this so that they can win. Because that is what they do. They win.


They win at all costs, that is how they got where they are.


To believe the HF's covered is to believe they accepted defeat by a bunch of autistic retards on the internet.

Stocks and buy & hold. Still the best DD. Nothing has changed since that perfect DD from weeks ago.  Shorts are not covered or only partially covered.

The GME DD from weeks ago already said that they will try everything to manipulate. Media, price and also your morale. Unfortunately, they have already managed especially the latter well. Yesterday, many of you have already given up.

But the fact is: If we continue, they will have to cover everything at some point.

You see huge swings up and down despite comparatively small volume? That is due to the low liquidity of GME shares. There are few shares available as most are holding. Therefore, small purchases / sales have a very strong impact on the price. Google liquidity in the stock market or read Gerd Kommer's books.

For example, someone in this sub has shown on the chart how a shortseller during a ""ladder attack"" was able to lower the price by over $100 with only 250 million capital. (Stoploss triggered etc.).

Today it was even more extreme. With a few thousand shares you could lift/press the price by 10% in no time.

All this speaks for the low liquidity and thus for the fact that the squeeze is still possible.

TL;DR: Buy & Hold. As said from the beginning.

TYO: 7261 Mazda Motor Corp +18.52%,6,ldkh9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldkh9s/tyo_7261_mazda_motor_corp_1852/,4,1612596875.0,"First of all, this is not financial advice. And I'm a retard, don't listen to me.

I noticed [Mazda's stock had shot up today](https://www.google.com/search?q=7261+Mazda&source=lnms&tbm=fin&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQkNqP8dPuAhVJ2qQKHay1BToQ_AUoAXoECAcQAw&biw=2560&bih=1297#scso=_C9MdYKOrNsyXkwWf7ICYDQ8:0), and closed today with +18.52%. So I tried to figure out why.

First of all, Mazda released a [revised financial forecast](https://newsroom.mazda.com/en/publicity/release/2021/202102/210204b.pdf) yesterday. But this doesn't look like such a big deal to me. Their 3rd quarter was good, and they've revised their prospected sales revenue up by 50 million Yen. Nice, but I don't think this would get the stock to jump +18%.

Then the 2nd bit of news. [Mazda is the first OEM automobile manufacturer to join the eFuel alliance](https://www.mazda-press.com/eu/news/2021/mazda-first-oem-to-join-the-efuel-alliance-/). This was announced today. So maybe this is the big news that made the stock jump?  
Some months ago I read an article about the new Skyactive 3.0 engine that Mazda has in developement. I don't remember where I read it, and it doesn't matter because it's not an official source. So the following is merely a rumor: The new Skyactiv 3.0 engine was said to achieve up to a 56% energy conversion. That is huge, bacause the most efficient car engines on the market today do around 40%. So an amount of fuel that would get you 100 miles in a current efficient car would get you 140 miles with the new Mazda engine in developement. That's no small difference. Current Formula 1 engines convert about 50%. So if any of those numbers are true, or close to true, that new Skyactiv 3.0 engine will give a huge jump in fuel efficiency. And Mazda joining the eFuel alliance might just be showing their confidence in this new engine.

But the Mazda stock has already gone up, and the Tokyo stock market has already closed. Too late, too bad, I missed this jump in stock price. Or did I?  
The Tokyo stock market closes at 3 PM local time. That's 07 AM Amsterdam time, or 01 AM New York. So the Japanese stock market has already closed for the weekend before Europe and America have had a chance to participate. And probably before we got the news. Maybe, just maybe, when the Japanese stock market opens monday morning (still Sunday for us), the participation of Europe and America might just give this stock another bump?

I don't know. I'm a retard and I'm just guessing. There is probably not going to be a 2nd bump on monday morning. But ... how big is the chance of Mazda's stock taking a dive next monday? I see no reason why Mazda's stock would dive. So it looks like it could be a safe bet. Maybe the stock gets a bump up, maybe it won't. But it doesn't look like it would go down, to me at least.

So I've put down a buy order.

This is still not financial advice! It's just the ramblings of yet another retard.

Every day the average ape shareholder has a smoother and smoother brain. It is likely that a good chunk of the remaining reasonable investors jumped ship today. We are approaching a supercritical amount of mental illness. The day to day trading price isn't important. If most every single $GME holder refused to sell, the price would climb rapidly. The important thing to the short squeeze is that the average $GME shareholder has as smooth a brain as possible.

Once platforms shut it down, I had the choice of buying the hedge back for $10K but no chance I was going to do that as common logic told me the stock would fall as a result of the platforms choice of dealing with the situation.

LESSON TIME: GME was short-sale restricted today. Here's what that really means.,3353,ldk5o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldk5o3/lesson_time_gme_was_shortsale_restricted_today/,370,1612595905.0,"Special shoutout to /u/UnempRetardaddy, who inspired me to write up this explanation. Unfortunately, WSB investors have picked up some half-truths with limited information, and are reaching a whole bunch of incorrect conclusions which they're using to justify advice to other traders. BAD MONKEYS.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

* Short attacks are real
* Short ladder attacks are not
* Any stock that falls 10% in one day (edit: compared to prior days close) is placed on a short-sale restriction for the remainder of that day and the next day
* Short-sale restriction *doesn't* prevent short selling
* It *does* effectively prevent short attacks
* GME was short-sale restricted today, which is why no short attacks could take place to drive the price down. All downward price movement was caused by shareholders.

&#x200B;

Let's go into detail:

&#x200B;

**Are Short Attacks real, and what are they?**

Yes. A short attack is simply selling so many shares short that you drive the market price down due to oversupply vs demand. *This works the exact same way as if a shareholder was selling their actual shares, and not borrowed ones.*

Let's imagine that a bunch of shares are all sold at market price at once. What happens?

Since they are sold at market price, they automatically meet the bid price offered by the highest bidder in the marketplace, then the next highest bidder, etc. As long as more shares are being sold than there are orders at the highest bid price, then the sale will continue to the next highest bid price, which drops the market price of the stock (market price simply being the last price the stock was sold at).

If the current highest bid is $100 a share for 100 shares,and the next highest bid on the books is for $99 a share at 1000 shares...Then to drop the market price down $99, I need to sell 100 shares at market price.And if I want to drop the market price down past $99 (to whatever the next highest bid is), I need to sell 1100 shares.

&#x200B;

**What are the risks of launching a short attack?**

When a hedge fund tries a short attack, they are taking a risk that there is more demand to buy shares at current market price than there is supply of shares they are willing to short sell.

If Melvin tries to short 1 million shares at $100 market price, but 10M shares worth of market price buy orders are immediately placed because people see the price dropping and want to buy the dip, then due to high demand vs supply the share price will go *above* $100, and now Melvin is in the red on their short position. For a real world example of this happening, see TSLA throughout 2020.

&#x200B;

**What makes a short attack successful?**

* Low trading volume - if there aren't a lot of buy orders on the books, there are fewer orders to meet at each price point, and fewer shares need to be sold to drive the price down.*For example: Thurs 1/28, when brokerages halted buying and artificially reduced demand*
* Large supply of shortable shares - there are only so many shares for a company, and only so many of those that shareholders are willing to lend out for short selling. A short seller needs a large enough supply to (temporarily)  overwhelm demand.*For example: Despite shorts available for GME being at or near 0, MMs were (legally) allowed to 'naked short', creating artificial supply which allowed hedge funds to short sell at the $500 peak on Thurs (and yes, its as unfair as it sounds)*
* Paper-handed bitches - This is the real key to success. If actual shareholders notice the price dropping and decide to sell as well, it creates a compounding effect, where supply increases even more, and price drops even more, and even more people decide to sell. This can also be caused by price drops triggering stop orders, as well as triggering margin calls by driving accounts below margin maintenance.
* Psychological manipulation - This is a corollary to the previous point. If every shareholder had a sense that the price drop was only due to a short attack, they'd probably hold. But if they see news stories saying shorters closed their positions, that everyone is switching to buying silver, that brokers are halting buying and no one can help drive the price up... well, it makes it a lot easier to justify selling.

For the greatest example of all four of these elements at work, see GME between last Thursday and this Monday, between the brokerage restrictions (and the Market Maker margin reqs behind them), the media misinformation campaigns, the incredible abuse of naked shorting in the name of 'market liquidity', and the reality of the bull side being a lot of retail investors without deep pockets who overextended at high prices and didn't have enough collective reserves to buy the dips, so they ended up selling.

&#x200B;

**Are Short** ***Ladder*** **Attacks real?**

The claim behind a short ladder attack is similar to the Short Attack described above, with the added flavoring that colluding hedge funds are just selling back and forth to each other. This is impossible.

Note, per above, that *short attacks* are quite real. What makes a short ladder attack nonsense is the belief that hedge funds can direct who their sell orders go to, or that it's possible to constantly bid a price down in an open market place, where anyone can place a market 'buy' order and prevent the price from dropping till their order is met.

The closest we came to this notion was last Thursday, where the big players just straight up cheated and shut down much of the buy side of the market, so that, in effect, hedge funds may very well have just been short selling to each other. But that is more due to the environment created by those (hopefully unique) events.

Shoutout to /u/EmptySet2 for his further breakdown of why it's not a real thing, here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the\_myth\_of\_the\_short\_ladder\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/)

&#x200B;

**What is the Short Sale Rule (aka 'Alternative Uptick Rule' aka 'Rule 201' aka 'Short-Sale Restriction')?**

There's a bit of history here, with some changes to the rules over time. I'll talk about most recent version of this restriction, which was implemented in 2010:

1. If any security falls more than 10% within a single trading day, it triggers the 'Alternative Uptick Rule' for the remainder of that day, and for the duration of the next trading day.
2. While that rule is in place, short selling is only permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid (aka on the uptick).

This is required to be enforced by the system as a whole. For this rule to be broken, everyone would have to be in on it, from brokers to clearing entities to market makers. It would be a big fucking deal.

&#x200B;

**How does this stop a short attack?**

Recall from earlier that a short attack is just selling a bunch of shares at market price, driving the price down as you meet each next highest bid.

Well, quite simply, while GME is short-sale restricted, short sellers *cannot* sell their shorted shares to the current highest bidder. They have to set their own ask price above that highest bid price, and wait for a buyer to meet it.

What does this mean? It means that on a day like today, a short attack by its very nature isn't permitted to happen. *All short selling can do on a day like today is suppress the price from going up*. If the current share price is $60, a hedgie could short sell 10 million shares at an ask of $60.01, and thus the price wouldn't go past that until all 10 mil are bought out.

&#x200B;

**What does this mean about current stay of play of GME?**

Broadly put, for the past week there have been alternating days of massive short attacks, followed by lulls or even upward price movement during the short-sale restricted days.

Yesterday there was a whole lot of shorting and/or shareholders exiting positions, driving the price down more than 10%. Today, we saw a relatively stable price as only shareholders could sell at market price.

Put 2 and 2 together and take a wild guess what's coming Monday.

(Edit: a short attack. That's what's coming. Or maybe it isn't, it's just going to be possible again. Just be aware of the possibility that wasnt there today. )

Maybe my crayons have just kicked in idk but it sounds solid to me anyway. 

so this is the plan:

1) Monitor Blue chip stonks that slowly rise on the steady (like PG, JNJ, JPM, MMM, HD, GS, etc.). Wait for dip.

2) Buy calls 5% otm that expire two-three months out (unless delta is < .2 or .3 or theta/prem is crazy) (i also have been monitoring technicals to make sure I buy at the right time.)

3) close position with one month remaining to exp. if you're happy with 10 Ds. 

The idea is, you pay a few hundo for a juicy 'tract on a juicy stock, let that MF premium get rock hard jacked and dip when you've made 50-100% depending on how steady it rose. Now the reason im writing this post.. 

I've played with this strat on TOS's ""ondemand"" platform and I've seem amazing results, I've yet to try it out for realsies.

This is my first post to wsb but I have had a fucking blast over the last week with all the ups and downs. I’ve known from the beginning that this is a casino and have been buying amc and gme in small amounts every day for the past two weeks. 

A lot of people are down on all of this bitching about all the money they’ve lost but obviously they don’t know how to gamble. 

This is better than playing poker or blackjack or baccarat at the casino but there are a Fuck load of people who don’t see how much this market is all about gambling smart. 

Don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose. Pretty obvious one if you’ve ever seen any idiot bottomed out at the chino maxing out their credit cards and getting pissed off at every dude who makes a bad play at the table because they think it is the one reason they lost all their money.

None of the above are possible. First, the vast majority of us here are not normal, and the forum was never normal. Second & third, it is impossible to go back to the pre-GME days of WSB for obvious reasons - too much attention, shills, bots and other fuckers (yea I know many fantastic retards have joined the ranks). Also, War has changed us all. While some have deserted the front lines, most are still fighting bravely (including myself...holding my 25 shares bought at $262 LOL and waiting for payday to buy some more).

However, it may be more realistic to, if other stocks are purchased while this thing is ongoing, to promoting the buying of equal or greater amounts of GME - that is, if a retard is unwilling or unable to commit to GME 100%. This may, in the long run, boost moral and calm people psychologically. This whole thing may take weeks to run its course and we need as many soldiers as we can muster up for the cause.

GME short covering mechanism,7,ldjsqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjsqz/gme_short_covering_mechanism/,15,1612594910.0,"Many are claiming its impossible shorts have covered. I offer a humble counter argument for consideration. I don't want to ruin the fun, but just drive some grounded discussion. Apologies in advance if I'm missing something.

&#x200B;

So presumably most short positions were using shares loaned out by the biggest holders - Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard etc. Collectively they own \~78M shares out of the 70M total float ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)). This means these institutions had lent their shares to shorts, shorts sold those lent shares on the open market, and institutions had bought these same shares again ... so they may have been betting on this whole squeeze themselves. ([https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional\_holdings.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp))

&#x200B;

Ok so squeeze happens, shorts panic etc. They buy as much as they can off the open market, and start returning shares to these institutions. So let's say these 78M shares were bought on open market and drove the peak price on 1/28. In the three days leading up to this peak, trading volume was \~150M shares per day.

&#x200B;

Here's the important part. As shorts were covering off of the open market, shares were returning to the institutions who had lent them out. So the institutions can sell these fresh shares directly to the shorts. This is in the institutions' interest because of massively inflated prices. So the institutions sell their shares to the shorts, returning shares to the open market. This is what allows the shorts to cover while a bunch of apes with diamond hands sling poo around the internet. If correct, we might see institutional ownership of GME has decreased substantially, but these numbers aren't public until 3/31 - and institutions have plenty of time to repurchase their shares before then.

&#x200B;

Tldr: 111% institutional ownership meant most short covering returned shares to institutions, who could sell those shares again to help shorts cover. 111% x 2 = 222% short covering this way, with only the first 111% of short shares bought on the open market prior to the peak.",2021-02-06 09:01:50

Any gamma or short squeeze has only one relief valve: more shares. You marvelous bastards didn't sell at $400, and you didn't sell at $50... and if/when the squeeze hits, you have earned your tendies. The thing is - selling early is a BAD THING™ and means you are letting Melvin, Groucho, and Harpo off cheap.

When the green tsunami rolls into town, think long and hard about when you want to sell. Think about all the shady big money interests along the way who have worked against you, likely colluded, and are ready to rob you of your future for the chance to maintain the status quo (them on top).

Think long and hard about how much pain they caused each of us. Not just this week, but our entire lives.

Why the SEC Short Interest report on the 9th is already priced in and we will see the squeeze next week 🚀🚀,296,ldjp7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjp7c/why_the_sec_short_interest_report_on_the_9th_is/,44,1612594634.0,"Everyone is waiting for the [SEC Short Interest Report](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) report coming out on February 9th. However, that report will not be accurate according to current situation.

**Reason:
1: The settlement date for that report was on January 29th. Meaning, anything from the Feb 1 til now is not included.


So what happened leading up to the 29th? On the 28th, Robinhood and other brokers restricted purchasing of shares. Collusion or not, it sent the price plumetting to sub 200. Situation was great for the shorts to cover their positions a bit and make their report kosher. Price recovered a bit on Friday after some purchasing was allowed. However, by this time, the shorts already fixed their books to not get in trouble.


2: Now that the 29th has come and gone and the hedgies had something to hand over to the SEC, they started doubling down. Starting from Monday, EVERYONE noticed the aggressive short ladder attack and more shorts were being done.


3: Prices have plunged from $325 close on the 29th to $53.50 by close Thursday 2/4. The reason why they can do whatever they want is that the next settlement date for the report is on Friday 2/12. So the real important date is the 12th.


**What to expect


1: The report on the 9th will be good to please the SEC. Everything will point to 0 manipulation. Media and Jimmy Chill will be jerking off to the news and telling your wife to leave you.


2a: The report on the 9th will cause FUD and drive prices lower because everyone and the media will think that you apes are retarded. Shorts will cover and get out of their positions easily as price has dipped way back down.


**2b: If 2a does not happen and if everyone has diamond hands, expect 2/10 - 2/12 where the short squeeze happens. Why those dates? Because the next settlement date for the SEC report is the 12th and the hedgies have to make their report whole like how your wife's boyfriend makes her.

We've become #55 on the list of largest subreddits, many people here may already be professionals in their field, and I think it would be worth our time as a community to hold weekly events as a way to keep people interested in the stock markets. For many of us, myself included, this is our first experience purchasing our own stocks and building our own portfolios. Some of us may still be leery or polarized from recent events, but I think it's important for the future of our economy that we, (and you, the professionals) have a vested interest in each-other and a working friendship. The curtain is definitely there, but I think even from a common person standpoint, we all would stand to benefit from listening to you guys. Things like stock analysis, reading charts and how to understand them, even basic indicators would be really cool to discuss with a professional.

We all have a voice here, and upon reading (and posting) it's come to my attention that we need to take our opportunity and make something of it, rather than be a, ""mob of retards to fear"". If we take the initiative to learn, we will be respected and when we catch something like this in the future, it will be a done deal. No, ""Reddit children said this"" or the like, fighting media every step of the way.

In no way do I think this would change the state of the sub. In fact, I argue that WSB would have more loss porn than ever before. Studies show that those who believe they are educated are more likely to take risks. Frankly, losses just come with the territory here on r/wallstreetbets, and I would hope the moderators see this as a chance to build something beyond their wildest dreams of , ""just a movie deal"". It's easy to see the loss porn, but often times people have reasoning for how they got there. Even having something as simple as requiring an explanation on a post of loss porn would be nice, even if it's literally, ""I just felt like it was going up"".  People didn't show up to lose money on purpose, but it's nice to have a nugget of feedback if these people are honest with themselves enough to post their losses, or a way to look at previous AMA's and see something like, "" What did so and so say about bear crosses again?""

Sorry for this  long winded post, but if this concept already exists elsewhere, I'd really like to be a part of it. Retail investors are the future and I want to be as educated as possible via books, interviews, and what I can find online.

Some people are pointing out that I may have made a mistake in how I interpreted the information I posted earlier today that is now trending here, but I want to be clear that I \*want\* to learn. If you saw it as a shitpost, and you're a financial professional, I'd like to hear you out.

I’ve always heard about getting into the stock market and making more money off it. When I have had money, I’ve had no faith in myself so I’ve never entered the market. That changed on January 8th of this year. I finally entered the market through Robinhood with my measly $700. 

Things started out slow up until this past week. I live in Northern California and there was a massive snowstorm here that knocked out power on Monday. This week, I have power through a generator. But I missed one of the biggest moments in U.S. history being without power from Monday until Saturday. I don’t own AMC nor GME stock but I do hold Express that was also affected by what RH did.

I was so excited when I first got power to see that my portfolio nearly doubled in that time. And express was a big part of that. I then felt sadness seeing my value drop when I heard what was going on. I wanted to sell my stock. But then Reddit suggested this sub to me and I read up on what’s been going on and you all have inspired me to hold on to my measly 20 shares. I will not let them get away with market manipulation. I will not be controlled. Many of you out there will never be mentioned by your usernames in the media or anything like that. Many of you are worth 5-8+ digits. But let me tell you. You inspire us poor people to stand with you and to fight for what’s right. Remember, you guys are fighting a war. Only this war isn’t being fought with bullets and blood, but with paper and electricity. You all have tons of poor people out there rooting for you guys. Stick it to the fat cats. You all have a once in a lifetime chance to go down in history for changing not just the USA, but the world right now. Don’t surrender. Remember that this battle is for the future. For your kids, friends, cousins, nieces, nephews, and so on.

I haven’t been here that long but you guys have given me a reason to care and a cause to stand for.

$FUBO Sports Streaming and Gambling Wrapped Up in One,40,ldjet6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjet6/fubo_sports_streaming_and_gambling_wrapped_up_in/,52,1612593842.0," 

Hello there fellow degenerates. I know everyone still has their panties in a bunch over $GME and $AMC, but shockingly there are other stocks in the market. Before you rip off my head, just hear me out.

**$FUBO.**

Fubo TV is a streaming television service that allows you to cut the cord when it comes to cable. It provides over 250+ television channels and boasts perhaps one of the largest collections of sports channels. Apes from all over can watch their favorites from football to cricket (I hear that's popular with some crayon eaters abroad).

Now, you're probably thinking, ""So what? There are tons of streaming platforms out there, the market is dominated by established providers like Netflix and Hulu.....and now I'm bored because I have the attention span of a goldfish."" Well boys and girls, the thing that makes this turd so shiny is that last month **$FUBO** just bought Vigtory - a sportsbook platform - which they plan to use to establish a revenue stream. When I heard they were creating another way for a retard like myself to risk money, I felt a tiny tingle in my flesh flavored bean bag. Other sports betting companies like Penn Gaming and Draftkings are trading higher comparatively, and streaming platforms like ROKU are on another planet. This thing has room for growth.

Now the icing on the cake is that this news didn't come out until AFTER a large number of individuals decided to short **$FUBO** stock. It has a 73% short interest float since January 15th. Short interest volume was 31% today. So this stock does have the potential for a bit of the ole squeeeeeze. But that shouldn't be the reason you retards invest in this company. By **$FUBO** combining sports streaming and online gambling they could become leaders in the sports betting arena. **$FUBO** predicts a full launch of the platform before the end of 2021.

TLDR: **$FUBO** will be the new crack for sports betting addicts.

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

I've had my laughs from the GME pump and dump, trying to get back to making money now. Anyone still chanting diamond hands while they cry, fully clothed, in their parent's master bath tub while licking a photo a KFC bucket is officially excluded from this discussion. 

I have been on $AMD since around mid-2017, when the Ryzen hype was getting started (who the fuck you think started it). Let me tell you why now is actually a decent time to get involved: 

1. You're retarded, and financial strategy isn't your strength the way eating a jar of mayonnaise is. 
2. AMD has done everything they ever said they were going to do, including snatching the crown for single threaded performance from Intel. 
3. AMD's desktop, server, and mobile CPUs are industry leading products that are being sold above the MSRP for the first time in my memory. 
4. AMD's GPU lineup is more scarce than even NVIDIA's stuff (Performance in gaming is a wash)
5. AMD is currently valued \~$100 billion
6. AMD became profitable about a year ago, and wall street has been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but LISA FUCKING SU NEVER TAKES HER SHOES OFF. Pretty sure mama su bae sleeps in a pantsuit. 

So, it seems like you missed out, huh? Feeling a little down and out? Your wife's boyfriend ate all your popsicles?

Good news. Gospel, really. AMD's run is only half over. The other players in the space ($NVDA and $INTC) are both losing market share to AMD at a rapid rate. The thing is, due to legacy machines existing, and old people thinking computers run on ravioli, almost none of the market has made a CPU purchase until NOW. 

I'm talking about schools, corporations, POS, all that shit. Server farms. Government offices. They're all still running legacy Intel chips from 2012. Anyway, just saying that the growth (astonishing rate of 45% YoY for like 3 years) that $AMD has seen in revenue and EPS - that growth - will continue, and might actually accelerate this quarter, definitely going to pump after Q2 ER. 

Just look at the market cap of Intel ($260 billion last I gave a flying fuck). AMD is a more valuable company long term. They make better products. They attract better talent. They are smarter about who they work with (they were the first major partner of TSMC, now APPLE and INTEL are trying to squeeze in and suck the tit). They love enthusiasts. They are agile. 

And they are at the tippity top of the mountain, but they're only half way up. Think about it. 

I won't stop betting on AMD until their market cap is AT LEAST 50% of INTC. should be around $120 per share. My position is almost all shares right now, with a lonely $95 call expiring 3/12. Gonna give him some friends pretty soon.

Sunpower (SPWR) set to have a 150% run up! 💎🙏🏼☀️🔌🚨🚨🚨,15,ldj2il,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldj2il/sunpower_spwr_set_to_have_a_150_run_up/,21,1612592898.0,"Let’s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)

I have been looking for a long term hold and I think I found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the 
hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.

Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. It also has had a good consolidation in the last week so no is a great time to buy.

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.

If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.

It's unclear what Wanda will be doing with those shares, but if they decide to sell them (***similar to Silver Lake converting its AMC Notes to Equity and selling into the market***), they could increase the AMC float by \~50MM shares and decrease short interest significantly.

**If Wanda sells its shares into the market, the short interest would decrease and so the chances of a big short squeeze would also decrease** (because now there are \~50MM more shares that everyone needs to buy to get back to the same place we were before this announcement).

The new hiring show that they might be headed in that direction. All they need is to ride the wave we have created for them.

I work in Strategy and Innovation and I am sure game stop has similar people on their roles who are trying to figure out how to capitalize the new found fame. I can think of atleast 10 different things they can do, they probably have plenty more ideas.

The way GME can thank us is, by proving that they are a $1000 company and not the $0 the HF thought.

First, they called WSB many names. Greedy, selfish, insane, gambling addicts, colluders, apes, and even extremists that may be associated with the Capitol insurgents.

Second, they released articles saying the shorts have been covered and that hedges have exited their positions. 

Third, they released articles saying silver is the next target of WSB. Through divide-and-conquer, distraction, and diversion tactics, they made WSB to seem to invest in a boatload of other things, when it's only GME that mattered. The eventual increase in share price of the other stocks pale in comparison and so could be treated as a loss, as long as GME losses are minimized.

Fourth, they made your wives fondle RH's, Etoro's, and other brokers' balls to restrict and limit trading, and to outright sell your shares without your consent or even knowledge.

Fifth, they infiltrated the sub and spammed nonsense to cast doubt and division among WSB and the Reddit community.

Sixth, they probably artificially inflated ala pre-mature ejaculation the share prices in order to cull the paper hands and gay bears. Right after this, they restricted the trading to further dampen the losses. Then, they plummeted the share price to drive home the fact that you should've sold around 300 and now people are panic-selling at a super low price. Hence, people fighting now and shit-calling WSB. 

Seventh, in line with six, they probably paid a loss forward by buying a lot of shares, spiking the share price, and then selling them all off and buying back, triggering a chain reaction among retail investors.

Eight, they're fearmongering by tying DVF to a palisade and setting it on fire.

Ninth, they're showing off your wives to the SEC.",2021-02-06 10:05:08

Some info for the 🦍:  
Settlement Date: They are reporting short interest positions for their holdings on 2/29 @ 6pm. Thats the day GME was highest!  
Due date: They have to turn in the report on this day.  
Exchange Recipt/Dissemination Date: When those reports get published. Reports are published at 4pm on this day. This is when we will know if they covered any of their position or not.  
  
I've never done anything like this before, but I imagine 2/9 is going to be very interesting. If its known that they haven't covered their position yet then its likely many more people will buy in and trigger the squeeze.  
  
But watch out, they are going to be doing everything in their power to delay the squeeze and manipulate people! They might find a way to put off the squeeze until the next report on 2/24, so don't lose hope if nothing big happens on 2/9.

GM - Super Bowl Ad - Disaster Marketing,18,ldkzf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldkzf3/gm_super_bowl_ad_disaster_marketing/,7,1612598379.0,"Hello GM,

Nice new logo BTW. 

I watched your GM electric car commercial(s) that will be played during the Super Bowl (available on YouTube).

To summarize: Will Ferrel educates America that Norway buys more electric cars than any other country and we need to “crush them” (wow sounds like us needed to crush the shorts).

So let’s break this down:

1. You insulted Norway (the largest consumer of the car your looking to sell). Nice 👌

2. You told me nothing about why I should choose your car over others. Is it the battery? You mentioned it, but what does it do? Nice 👌

3. When someone’s looking to buy a car, when the fuck do they ever think hmmm, wonder what those Norwegians are doing. Nice 👌

4. Now I’m looking at what car Norwegians (the people who buy the most electric cards) prefer. It’s Audi and Tesla if your curious. Nice 👌

* GME at $320 
* AMC at $12.  

I'm thinking of starting to average down my positions for both.

For AMC, I will be able to average down my cost to $7.50 per share.  Prior to the pandemic, AMC was operating above this price and issuing dividends on a regular schedule. And I expect to watch the next James Bond movie in an AMC theatre once vaccines are distributed.  By averaging down, I will be shifting my horizon to the long term and I think this could work for a decent gain.

But, I'm not certain this strategy would work with GME.  At the current price, I could average down my position to $75, but that is still 3-4x higher than its historical performance (before the squeeze).  I'm wondering if there is a strategy for GME for those holding high?

Zomedica is a veterinary Biosciences company. They've done well for themselves, considering lots of Biosciences companies fail to turn a profit these days.

Yes you've probably heard of this stock before, but it's far from over. 

They have lots in the works: ""Still, Zomedica has a compelling growth opportunity. The veterinary health specialist is slated to launch its patented Truforma diagnostic system on March 30. The platform is designed to produce fast and accurate results when used to detect diseases in dogs and cats. InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango believes Zomedica could generate $250 million in revenue by 2025, thanks to Truforma's time- and cost-saving advantages over existing veterinary diagnostic methods. If he's right, Zomedica's stock could have more upside ahead.""

We should talk about the lessons that we should learn from this experience:

-	There is great power in memes. Seriously holy shit y’all. $18->$500?
-	Get off Robinhood. Use a real brokerage like Fidelity. 
-	The notion that it’s not a loss until you sell is dumb as hell. It might take you 15 years to recover the money in GameStop. But if you just sold at a loss, and moved it to a smarter investment... you might actually come out ahead by June. 
-	maybe don’t buy into a stock that’s up 800% in a week? 

When you sell for a loss, you are not admitting defeat. You are saying, “wow, my investment thesis was wrong. I should take this as a learning opportunity and re-examine the decisions and choices and beliefs I had entering this position.” I know you smooth-brain apes aren’t going to have this thought.

Nano Dimension long hold,30,ldm8l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldm8l8/nano_dimension_long_hold/,18,1612602171.0,"I’ll be buying and holding long term Nano Dimension or NNDM. 10th largest holding under ARKQ which is actively managed by Cathie Woods. Cathie manages ARKQ ARKW and ARKK. All great performing funds. 

NNDM Is the only stock under holdings for ARKQ that is less than $50. Its actually $15 right now. It crashed from a $60 IPO back in the day to $3 until ARKQ bought into it and other companies started to throw money at the company evaluating it much higher than it was. 

The reason it crashed in the first place was because their original ceo was arrested for fraud. Much better ceo in place as of January 2020.

The company has propriotity 3-D printing technology called ""dragon-fly"" that can 3-D print microchips. Its a big innovation in 3-D printing. This is good for chip companies and companies as a whole for 3 reasons. Companies would likely buy for these reasons.

1) It reduces costs since theres less waste. 

2) Don't have to worry about IP being stolen because companies can produce in-house. 

3) Probably the most important. The 3-D printing allows a chip manufacturer to be a lot more precise and fit more in less space. Something they were incapable of prior. 

The main thing is the company has terrible earnings because their innovation is new as of last year. But its significant enough to get the attention of cathy and other firms. Enough for her to make it her 10th largest holding as of this last year. Its gone up from 2 to 15 since then but i still thinks its not evaluated high enough enough because that technology alone should prove to be very useful and very innovative for the years to come. And once they start showing positive earnings it'll probably blow up.

For $15 i thing its a good long hold since there could be a lot of upside potential. It's market cap is only 62 million. There EPS is getting better. Getting less negative except for Q3 in 2020. 

Definitely going to pick up some shares but thats just me 🤷🏻‍♂️. Just wanted to share, lil risky.",2021-02-06 11:02:51

AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.


On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.
 
The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.
 
The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:
 
Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.
 
Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  
 
Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.

*If I'm allowed to close my existing position, but retail traders are not allowed to open new positions, who's buying these closed positions?* 

The Eye Gangers replied, several days later, with the following personal email; 

*Thanks for your email. The restrictions are currently applied to all clients.*  
*To clarify further, all stakeholders and risks have to be carefully considered, and in this case we decided to prioritise safety of stakeholders, and thus take a more conservative approach to this unfamiliar market behaviour until we are confident that our systems can hold up and that risks can be quantified and managed effectively. This is by no means ideal for our clients, and we are not gaining from this restriction, but more-so buying ourselves time to assess and regroup. We hope to allow such instruments to be traded as soon as possible so that the market can be accessible and integrity can remain.*

By definition, a ""Stakeholder"" is a third party with a vested interest in the arrangement between the Service Provider (Eye Gangster) and the Client (me). 

I'm not an expert, but my wife's boyfried told me: 

1. By restricting my trades, there is an opportunity loss for every time I monkey mashed the ""Buy"" button, and the Eye Gangsters canceled the order. (Long with funds available in the account, not CFD)
2. Restricting trades by others caused my existing positions to lose value. 

As the Eye Gangsters (and presumably other brokers) freely admit they put the interest of Stakeholders ahead of the interests of their Clients, and since it could be argued that the actions of these Brokers resulted in losses, could this be grounds for a Class Action?",2021-02-06 10:53:13

Long story short, I managed to get 1546 or so shares at around 14.10 cost basis. I bought 6 GME at 118.

Little did I know the AMC hype at the time was due to GME momentum and so it's been closely tied to the price the whole time.

That said, my original intent was, they just got out of bankruptcy by raising 900m $$ the pandemic is ending with a hopeful vaccine deployment by end of spring and 2 years worth of movies backlisted from the pandemic. (2020 hits and now 2021 hits coming out) 

It was my genuine thought AMC would hit 20-30 by EOY. That's why I invested.

A little DD on SAVA and its recent news.,14,ldlvor,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldlvor/a_little_dd_on_sava_and_its_recent_news/,29,1612601098.0,"Hi all,

Recently I have been following the SAVA boom and decided to do a little research into the product they're producing and see if the juice was worth the squeeze.

Some background on the drug in question:

As you may or may not know, they are currently finishing up Phase 2b trials of their potential drug PTI-125 ([Clinical trial data](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04079803)). The drug is designed to target neurofilaments involved in Alzheimer's disease (specifically the tau protein) whose primary end-point was to reduce CSF concentrations of Tau protein. Preliminary studies were very successful in mouse models and their Phase 1 study show safety in patients. The initial phase 2b results at 28 days were not promising ([BioSpace results on PTI-125 Phase 2b trial](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/top-line-results-from-a-phase-2b-study-of-pti-125-in-alzheimer-s-disease-does-not-meet-primary-endpoint/?fbclid=IwAR1jnBoGT0LYDf31S0brGXeJcSRs7uvzhGHxlmowIIKagkWKupSmKSNJabc)). They failed to meet their primary end-point (reduction in tau concentrations in CSF) and did not measure cognitive improvement (which is the main issue with Alzheimer's disease).

The catalyst for the big increase was this article released on Feb 2, 2021 ([Cassava Sciences info release](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-simufilam-improves-cognition-and-behavior?fbclid=IwAR3xfjI4azXErNN3BV5k5Qoubepi-LK9sPsfFfvyLiKmVgDOl4_pmY3MZuo)) which suggested promising results at 6 months. However, if we dig a little into the data itself we see that the mean improvement was 1.6 for the ADAS-Cog11 and 1.3 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. So what does that mean? Well if we look at previous studies which attempted to find the validity of these testing modalities we see that studies suggest a MINIMUM of 3 points improvement on the ADAS-Cog for clinical relevance ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22019547/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22019547/)) and other studies suggest it may not be relevant at all for measuring drug response ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23763450/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23763450/)). For the Neuropsychiatric Inventory data suggests that anything less than a >4 point reduction in scoring is not clinically relevant ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099101/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099101/)).

So based on the data we have so far I'm quite skeptical of the drugs effect to say the least. It appears to function according to its design in reducing CSF levels of circulating Tau protein and other neurofilaments it does not seem to provide a meaningful impact on the actual symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.

To add another layer of skepticism, according to Cassava Sciences recent market movement they last issued a stock offering in November ([Cassava stock offering](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/13/2126559/0/en/Cassava-Sciences-Announces-Pricing-of-75-Million-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock.html)) at a price point of $8. Their next opportunity for a stock offering is next Thursday. Take that for what it's worth, which could be nothing.

So, bottom line is I would be hesitant to put big money into this company long term. For the short term holders, you're likely to see huge swings in the price in the coming days and weeks but I don't think it will be based on the merits of the drug.

Good luck and thanks for reading! I welcome any evidence countering these thoughts and look forward to some good discussion.

&#x200B;

EDIT: also, I hold no current positions in this company but if I were to open a position it would like be early/mid March puts. I don't suspect good news from the FDA about clearing this drug so some of the potential catalysts are likely irrelevant at best and damning at worst.",2021-02-06 10:44:58

In response to the posts claiming it's impossible that Melvin Capital/other hedge funds closed their short position,93,ldlp4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldlp4l/in_response_to_the_posts_claiming_its_impossible/,38,1612600544.0,"I see these posts on why it's impossible that they closed their position and I feel they are somewhat misleading.

First, we must simply admit that we don't know, and nobody knows except the hedge funds themselves. Some posts claim it's impossible based on volume; this is just not true. There were days last week where the volume was nearly 400% of the float. All the shorts could have even closed on the same day. And we saw share price skyrocket up which is what you would expect if they were closing their shorts.

Now, on Melvin Capitals claim that they closed their short position. I find that very unlikely, though we must admit we actually don't know. Nobody knows the truth except Gabriel Plotkin/his team. But here's my argument based on 2 premises:

1. There are no sources to Melvin for the claim they closed their short positions. There are no official statements from anyone at Melvin, no press releases, no evidence, no data, nothing. Melvin even shut down their own website, it's currently just a picture of their logo nothing more. Try to find the source of any one of those news stories: It is literally a news reporter claiming ""we talked to somebody from Melvin and that they told us they closed their short position."" In terms of market manipulation culpability, how can you find Melvin Capital guilty? You take him to court and he says ""I never said that."" And you have no evidence that he did, where's your case? News agencies print whatever they think will give them the most viewers, easy to see motivation for CNBC to post without caring whether it's true.
2. It seems implausible that one of the best shorters in the game would voluntarily realize the losses on a position when two conditions hold: The price is currently way above a fundamentals justified valuation hence given enough time it will surely crash. And two, that they have the resources to ride it out until that time. The second condition is often called into question, but I believe it must be true here; if they weren't margin called before the 2.75B investment, it's quite unlikely another billionaire investment genius would invest 2.75B into a fund which he thought would still be at immediate risk of getting margin called and losing everything.

Now to Point72 and Citdal's 2.75B investment. They didn't lend Melvin money, they invested. What they've done can sort of be compared to them shorting the stock at the peak, with favorable conditions due to Melvins position of need. They invested to get a ""non-controlling portion of the revenue.""

If Melvin is down 50% from their short positions, and citadel/point72's 2.75 billion allows them to ride through the peak without being margin called, then when they actually do close their short positions at a lower market price than the price when they received the 2.75B investment, then the investors (citadel/point72) immediately see a massive return on their investment. For ex, just suppose for sake of argument that the price dips to the number that Melvin originally shorted at and instead of these losses they broke even from the short. Since they were currently down 50% at the time of investment, it takes 100% of that amount to get back to where they were, i.e. 50%+50% = 100%. Thus the 2.75 billion Citadel/point72 invested see's 100% return in a couple weeks. GME likely won't drop that low, but it's already dropped from 400+ to 50$, so it's actually already most of the way there. Citadel and point72 are already winning huge.

There are things they could do which would make the claim that they ""closed and re balanced their portfolio"" technically true while still holding a massive short position in GME. For example, they claim to have closed on days where the price ranged from 150-400+$/share. They could have done some combination of closing short positions and re-opening short positions, as the effect of their buying to close shorts increased the price. As the price increased, they could profit off arbitrage between bid/ask; This can be done by closing at ask and re-opening at bid whenever bid/ask pushes upward. They surely have access to the ability to do this, as Citadel themselves is a market maker and this is exactly why Citadel pays so much for Robinhood's data. They use the data as a market maker to profit off arbitrage by prioritizing their own trades as all the other trades come in. I won't go into the details of profiting off arbitrage, but you can find plenty of sources online that explain how it's done and that Citadel is known to do this. It is questionably legal.

They may also simply not have closed their short position, as they would have to weigh the benefits of arbitrage profit and reduced ability to be margin called from 300$+/share price vs. the high borrowing rate (30%+) to short at the time. So if the 2.75B investment allowed them to sit through the peak last week, it may have been better to do that. Again, we just don't know.

So ultimately I feel it's misleading to draw conclusions which predict the market based on the analysis of whether Melvin/other funds closed their short positions last week. What really matters for GME's price in the future is that whatever the short interest rate turns out to be when the actual data is released on the 9th, a large number of all hedge fund shorts are now shorting from 300$+/share price. This is based on the short volume over the last 2 weeks being relatively high, on some days exceeding trade volume. It's going to be much, much harder to get shorts from 300$+ margin called.

Now all these new short positions are ITM and they'd like to realize their gain. If GME stays in the double digits AND continues to have high volume, they will have no trouble doing this. If volume goes down, then they are put in a tricky position as it increases the effect attempting to close their shorts by buying the stock has on the share price. So the biggest hope we have for a future price spike and possible squeeze is to see volume drop.

We are in a situation of balancing forces. The price can only go up so much above a fundamentals based justified price before new shorters enter the game. This is where the comparison to VW fails, as Porsche locked up so much of the float that there actually weren't enough shares left on the market for this kind of balancing of forces to play out.

Not financial advice, am retard.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

I also just wanted to add that another way Melvin / hedge funds can profit off this whole thing is when they open their shorts at 300$+/share, they can short additional fake shares. Based on the absurdly high failure-to-deliver numbers for GME, this is certainly being done. They simply short shares they don't have when they see the price as so unreasonably high that it will drop i.e. 300$+/share, and don't even have to pay interest on them. It increases the downward push shorting has on the stock price and increases your total potential gain for the new short position. And it's not necessarily good news to us retail investors like the post who say 'ahah theyre fucked they have to cover these made up shorts too'; it's just another tool they have that pushes GME price down and increases their profits. It would only become a problem if volume drops very low and/or a whale comes in a locks up a huge percentage of the float.

&#x200B;

realized sub is retards, needs tl;dr

tl;dr it doesn't really matter whether Melvin closed their position or not. Short volume incredibly high when GME price was high = whatever the current short % is, most are now shorting from 300$+/share and ITM. And they will have no have a problem cashing out these ITM shorts as long as volume remains relatively high. ",2021-02-06 10:35:44

a. as of 1/15 there were 61.78M shares shorted out of a total 46.89 shares available to short

b. according to S3 estimates, shorties didn't start covering until about 1/28

c. total volume of gme since 1/28 (inclusive): 58.82 + 50.26 + 37.38 + 78.18 + 42.7 + 59.75 = 327.09M

d. weighted average of gme price (upon close) since 1/28 (the weight is the price's respective volume as a percentage of the total volume since 1/28):

193.6\*0.1798 + 325\*0.1537 + 225\*0.1143 + 90\*0.239 + 92.41\*0.1305 + 53.5\*0.1827 = $131.9987

e. assuming shorties played a game of numbers and DCA'ed, $131.9987 should be their estimated average cost per share

f. current estimated short interest is 39% (18.2871M shares), so the amount of covered short shares would be: 61.78 - 18.2871 = 43.4929

g. estimated total cost to cover (d \* e): 131.9987\*43.7929 \~ $5.7806B

1) we know this estimate is lower than what it really is because in our calculations we assume that only shorts are covering and no new shorts are being opened between 1/15 and now, however, in S3's estimates, short interest is accumulated after it's first decent from the range of 126% - 131%, therefore more shorts must have been covered and new shorts opened

2) we don't know how many shorts covered nor how many new shorts opened, but I would guesstimate this isn't greater than a factor of 3 (I know, shit mathematics right here, but we don't know these numbers, so this has to be a ballpark estimation)

h. estimated amount spent on gme since 1/28 (d \* h): 131.7428\*327.09 \~ $43.0918B

i. given that $43.0918B was spent and only $5.7806B (within a factor of 3; so max 17.3418B) was spent on covering shorts, it is possible that shorts have covered the amount reported by S3

PCG to double by EOY. This is a conservative estimate.

PCG got CRUSHED in 2018 by starting a massive wild fire and killing... too many people. It got gutted. Regulated. Fined.

Massive debt, bad rep, massive safety compliance regulations (hurts profits, but keeps people safe).

So where is the upside?

Nov 2020, new CEO hired (Patricia ""Patti"" Poppe). Female, intelligent, good track record. Not your typical middle age white executive ""I got this job because I know someone"", but a straight up BOSS. New VP and customer service executive appointed Jan 2021, and FUCKING **PALANTIR'S** FOUNDRY software announced in the same month... last month! 

They are the very FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FIRST! Need a high tech, intuitive, data analytics software to keep your power grid safe and efficient? How about THE BEST SOFTWARE AVAILABLE. Fuckin' Patti Poppe knows what she's doing. 

New, boss level CEO steps in, knows this dumpster fire needs 2 things, better management and better software.

This is a recovery story waiting to happen. 

They ALSO just announced selling nearly $1 billion in rights to cell providers to use their existing towers. No work required, just a billion dollars check to help cover current debt... just by selling rights to a small chunk of their MASSIVE infrastructure.

They're starting to move, low risk, possible 2-5x return in 1-3 years. Lost half your net worth on GME?  Check out a safer, but bullish alternative.

Nio dd for people who actually wanna trade a stock that won’t go bankrupt,100,ldmag7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldmag7/nio_dd_for_people_who_actually_wanna_trade_a/,60,1612602343.0,"Now that we have 8.6 million degens here it’s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO

Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. 

My bull case....🚀

EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.

Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.

That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.

Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. 

Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries. 

They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.

NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. 

Cameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.

Why Short Interest (SI) could be the same on 2/9,19,ldnhsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldnhsf/why_short_interest_si_could_be_the_same_on_29/,19,1612606254.0,"For people who are hanging a lot on the upcoming SI report on 2/9, this is just something you may want to consider. I replied to someone with this comment but have found that I’ve been copy/pasting it a lot because a lot of you guys seem confused about shorts and short interest. So if that’s you, here goes: 

“I’ll paint with a broad brush here but imagine that a year ago the hedge funds borrowed the equivalent of 50% of GMEs float to short when it was at 20/shr. (For illustration purposes let’s say that’s 100 shares.) They then sell those shares and collect $2000, confident that when the time comes to return the borrowed shares, GME will be 2/shr, allowing them to buy the 100 shares for $200, return them and pocket the 1800 profit they made originally. 

But disaster strikes! A bunch of dumb Redditors band together and invest en masse, driving the stock price up to 100/shr. Meaning that on due date, the HF now needs to shell out $10,000 to cover, putting them at an 8k loss. 

But it gets worse. Because these Redditors are MAD. Like, slinging poop at the walls mad. And so the stock looks primed to keep rising like crazy in the near future. What do you do?

Well, if you’re a multi-million dollar HF manager, you devise a dastardly yet overall smart plan: cut your losses and cover your short position at a loss. So you go in and buy like crazy, giving you a substantial loss. But for every short you close, you immediately open a new one to take its place at the current market price, which let’s say is now 200/shr. Now, you’re very confident that these Redditors will eventually go away and the stock will fall back to its position last year at 20/shr. 

And now you’re in a position where you’re not pocketing the profit from the stock falling from 20/shr to 2/shr, you can pocket the profits from it falling from 200/shr to 20/shr. Much better position for you and despite the fact that the short interest is still the same, your position is safe because for the “squeeze” to happen, stock would have to be run alllllll the way back up to above 200/shr. 

In short, money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr for the hedgies, as fucking always.”

TL;DR - SI may very be the same in the 2/9 report but their positions will be very different.",2021-02-06 12:10:54

- Nobody knows.  Nobody will ever KNOW.  Taking advice from anyone on the internet or in real life, especially when finances are involved is idiotic.  Quickly think about every comment you’ve made pumping GME with rockets and Diamond emojis this month?  Ever wonder why you were doing that?  Because you had a particular interest and benefit of the stock price going up — that’s pumping so you can get the price high enough for you to make money and then leave the others in the dust.  This is the exact thing pumpers are doing to you.  It is VITAL that you stop relying on Reddit comments, start doing research, and put your time to good use since time is in fact, money.

• *The market is so manipulated, it’s completely unfair and the hedge funds always get away with it!*

- Yes.  You’re right & that is a healthy and intelligent observation.  The unfortunate truth is this will keep happening.  There are forces at work so much bigger than any of us and if any of you were a part of the top .01% you would also be clinging on to the power and greed of owning the world — or you at least wouldn’t relinquish that power to a bunch of college kids on an online forum.  I love the underdog, everybody wanted a David and Goliath ending to this but it’s just not feasible and it’s time you stop taking your decision to over-leverage and/or fail to take profit,  out on the market.   It is important you begin to study and understand the trends and statistics behind the actual market.  Please, the slightest bit of REAL research could lead to your next play — the one that could save you from this GME mess.  If you learned how to trade options you could’ve bought puts and at least balanced out your losses on your GME shares on the way down instead of just eating those bags.

• *So what, I just sell my GME shares for a huge loss?*

- No.  I would never instruct anybody to sell or buy anything.  That’s the entire point of this post.  To encourage others to learn how instruct themselves in the stock market (considering how many of you are completely new & your first trade may have possibly been one of the most volatile in recent history).  Keep your shares, that’s the beauty of shares is that you own them and over time that value may eventually come back, especially if you use other equity to generate enough money to average down your position over time & eventually come out on top.  The only way you will achieve this though is removing GME from your watchlist for a while, studying up & finding new tickers with real promise instead of “short squeeze” opportunities and quick spike situations where you will inevitably be fucked.

• *I used all my money on this last play, I can’t do anything now*

- Even if that is the case, I’d hope you still have an income or the ability to collect some money over the next few weeks and months WHILE YOU STUDY.  The perfect opportunity to learn is when you’re forced to watch market action without being able to participate.  You will be able to accurately see trends, and movements without getting FOMO or YOLO-ing in at the top.  Learn about options and you will realize that even $100 can be turned into thousands — I’ve done it multiple times this year ( [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn9px/new_traders_please_read_in_regards_to_gme_market/gm6ub0e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) ) but the knowledge of trading option contracts and having the ability to make money on green and red days is immeasurable.  Please, I beg of you, go watch a YouTube video or search wsb for a TRUE DD post from a year or two ago in which you’ll learn a ton of shit that can help you.

• *Well the market is closed right now so why does this matter?*

• It’s the weekend, get the fuck off your ass and away from DOGGE~DYCOIN and make your time make you money.

Study options, the Greeks (most important THETA) — learn about the indexes; S&P 500 ($SPY), NASDAQ ($QQQ), DOW JONES ($DJIA), and THE VIX — an important indicator of volatility in the market — the VIX ($VXX) can help you determine the direction of the market before it happens, learn it and utilize it!!!

I’m begging you please, this will do nothing but help you and keep you away from $ROPE or worse....giving up on the stonk market.  I only want the best for you all so I suggest you drop the retard act for two days to figure out how you’re going to approach this Monday morning.",2021-02-06 11:59:14
Mini-Tendies for Bag-Holders,49,ldn9ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn9ef/minitendies_for_bagholders/,11,1612605521.0,"Good Evening Smooth-Brainers

Tonight I have a topic that has come up in the messages I received since my last post several times. I can safely assume that there are about 6million bagholders in this sub now as a result of the insane collapse of GME and AMC over the last 5ish trading days. I sincerely hope this information can benefit at least one of you monkeys.

The topic today is Selling Covered Calls against your shares. 

First of all, this only works if you have 100 shares or more. The reason for this is because each call you sell requires collateral of 100 shares (unless you already have a metric shit ton of money in your account and your broker lets you YOLO to your heart’s content).

“But Taco I only have 17 shares of XXX , can I sell part of a call?” What? No. 100 or bust. If you don’t have 100 shares you have two options: buy more shares to get to 100 or keep doing what you’re doing. 

This is how it works. I will use AMC as an example as it is more likely to be the stock that you apes have more than 100 shares of because you missed the boat on uber-cheap GME shares. As of 4pm EST, AMC was trading at $6.83. Yeah, that sucks if you bought this 15 or higher, but what are ya gonna do? Cry about it? No way. You got into this biz to make money, not be a chump.  I will be using 15 as the average price for my example below. 

Take those sets of 100 shares and make them work for you. Go look at the option chains in RH or whatever trading platform you are using. See there are two columns? Bid and Ask. Bid = Sell, Ask = Buy. Yeah, all these days/months/years you have been buying calls/puts you have been paying the Ask price. Now you are going to jump over to the greener side of the field and sell options to other apes.  (note: you cannot sell options after hours, so you gotta wait until Monday morning, sorry). 

So, now that you know what column to look at you are going to sell some calls. Pick the dollar amount you are happy with. If you want to at least break even in the absolute worst case scenario, choose 15. As 15 is pretty far away now, the premium is gonna be fairly terrible, but its your choice.  Once you sell the call you will receive the premium, which is the number in the Bid column. Congrats! You sold a call. Your shares made you a little bit of money. Now sit back and enjoy the ride.

“But what's our max loss?!” Easy. There is no loss. If you sold your options for 15 as I said above, if the stock ends up over 15 by the time the option expires, you will sell 100 shares for 15/share. Congrats you made even money on this trade and you get to keep the premium. If AMC is trading under 15 when the option expires, congrats you keep your 100 shares AND you keep the premium. Then do it all over again next week! Repeat until you lose your shares!

It seems complicated, but it is a fairly straight forward process.  As always I am happy to answer question, just shoot me a message as the comment section has been buggy as heck lately.

(This is absolutely not financial advice)

Jump on board the theta train and let the smaller tendies rain in!

2) AMC go down. Monkey sad.

I’ll be the first to say correlation does not mean causation and history does not always repeat itself in the markets. But come Monday, this could mean good things for $SNAP. 

This is coming off a solid and strong ER and some great comments made from Evan on CNBC and during their conference call.

This could be interesting and i also am vested in the situation financially.

Millions of new members and in the crosshairs of the entire world. A pause to think about the path forward and consider the obstacles as we as a sub move forward,32,ldn4bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldn4bc/millions_of_new_members_and_in_the_crosshairs_of/,30,1612605047.0,"Reposting this just because I tried to get this idea out on a crazy titled post that was removed... but feel it should be thrown up for debate. Or crucifixion more likely. But fuck it. 

Here's my sentiment on the current situation of all of us, this situation with GME and whatever.... I feel this merits serious thought so... if anyone agrees lets discuss. Like the intelligent bad mother fuckers we are. 

Remember, act like you've been there. 

We all should know what we’ve done. Everyone here has now been there. I’m not trying to talk shit for real. I’m just saying that sometimes the real hype and power in your words comes from the cold, calculating and poise inherent to people that know they know what is up, what to do, and how to do it.

If we’re going to thrive as a real group we all need to set examples for the new people here as senior members who have been through it. Think about the long term. We keep our memes and our jokes and our style but it’s gotta be immune to trends and outside influence because we see ourselves as professionals... professional renegades. Autists. Whatever you wanna call it. We need to all reel in the 4 million wild eyed new members and show them the way of WSB. Not for the now but for the future of the sub and the very fabric of the culture we’ve forged in fire here. The GME great short squeeze will go down in history. And it should. But we can’t let our own success be our demise. We can’t give the media and naysayers any ammunition. In fact. When they come here and lurk I want them to report back something somber. That it appears to be the Wild West but once you’re in it for a while you see the beautiful and subtle unspoken rules, respect for innovative ideas, respect for knowledge and respect for those that see an improbable outcome and bet wildly on it and win. Because talent hits a target no one else can and genius hits one no one else can see.

No one saw GME like WSB did. And if they had no other group of people would throw billions at this collective wild ass idea to force into reality what was just a crazy idea like this.

I know this will get downvoted to hell. But the point is to throw your two cents into the machine and hope the butterfly effect is in your favor. Also in that vein I’d like everyone here to consider what effects their own agenda is behind a post and the effect it may have on the whole of the sub. And in turn the lives of those that live and breathe WSB, because for so long it’s not been a group of retards but rather one of the greatest collections of intellectual prowess on the internet. In realizing what we have here I am still amazed. I've been following this sub for about 3 years now and the crazy things I've seen here are nothing on the scale of GME but epic in their own right. The scale of a thing is not relative to the degree of badass it is. We do badass things here all the time if you just look at the DDs and dig into the sub. We all downplay ourselves because that’s the WSB way of being. We don't brag to the point of being insanely opposite most of the time. Hell my girlfriend was flat out appalled when I told her we affectionately call ourselves autists and it's a term of endearment... That's just who we are.

We do not brag. We do not seek to influence others. We all do what we do and at the end of the day love the others here. All jokes aside. Let’s not let GME and AMC take our sights off the long term. And the fact we have to incorporate 4-6? million new members and their ideas and agendas ect. *Now we are weak to outside influence more than ever before at a time when every cocksucker on Earth is setting their sights on us and gearing up the propaganda machines for some social financial engineering experiments that will be, no doubt, some heavy handed and long term projects that are seriously going to be difficult to survive as an 'independent' group of thinkers. For when we cross the murky line from ideas that naturally form here to ideas seeded and nurtured into our psyches and group think no one can see until it's in hindsight. The strongest way to defend against this is to encourage free thinking, intellectual and deep cultural norms that are inherently unwritten such that no imposter or seeded idea can survive the critical minds and crazy ass personalities here much less mimic being one of us... Just like you would know if one of your friends was an imposter because you just fucking know them down to the tiniest little thing, so too should we consciously forge and support this as a group. We should get it going and the new people can assimilate or move on. We should adapt to this new world that we've made, but do it with open eyes and a critical mind because there are serious dangers ahead my friends. *

Stop looking outside. The danger is now within. In our own success.",2021-02-06 11:50:47

Lessons to be learned from gme,51,ldmzqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldmzqh/lessons_to_be_learned_from_gme/,63,1612604599.0,"Not a post trying to shit on those who held or are holding gme. I bought gme. I held gme. I held it too late. And I got out at a loss. A pretty significant one. 

Even someone like me whose been doing this a few years and is very careful and disciplined can learn a thing or two here. First is you should always take out your initial investment if you are in doubt. I normally do this with most things. If the stock shoots up and doubles really quickly, I pull my initial and play with house money. If it does quickly maybe I sell the rest and buy low or if it stays consistent then I can always buy back in. But this way I don’t lose. I didn’t do this because I bought into the whole short squeeze and the idea that releasing any shares would kill momentum that we all were riding on. Always take out your initial or minimize loss. 

Second is don’t take losses too hard. I’ve had and a few downs. Gme was probably one of my bigger downs but it always gets better. Take some time away from investments, clear your head, and get back in there with your new knowledge and learned lessons. 

Third is beware of echo chambers and confirmation bias. Everyone in these gme threads are going to tell you what you want to hear (up until recently). The right play is always to hear and acknowledge both sides. Understand what you’re doing and go in when you can prove what you know and disprove what others are saying, to an extent. Now I’ve never been in something this big where the echo chambers were full of so much DD and evaluations and data. It made it hard to see things objectively and realize that a $10 to $500 was probably the squeeze!! Did the hedges and everyone else involved play fair? Hell no. But squeezes don’t just happen because you collectively buy a lot of stock. You can’t just squeeze any stock. A big player has to back themselves into a really terrible position they can’t get out of and have the guts to stick it out while you squeeze them. It’s a very rare thing. 

Fourth and finally is you should never put more money in than you are comfortable with losing completely. This is a gamble, even if you do your DD. It can always go wrong for any reason, many which you can’t even see coming, judging by this past week. Always know your maximum loss and assume that’s very possible and likely and make sure you’re okay with that. I think about it as putting in x and then that money disappearing. It never existed for me. Then if I cut my losses.. “Oh look, here’s (x - losses) amount of money that just showed up! I guess I can invest in something else now” 

Fifth, do you. If you’re still in gme because you believe in it, awesome. If you’re in it because you really believe in a squeeze, great. You gotta do what you believe in. But make sure it’s your belief that driving your actions and that it’s not you latching on to sentiments from others and trying to fool yourself into believing their yours. Would you still do it if you could no longer discuss it in wsb or on Reddit? Would you still buy or hold? Would you sell? Do you look up your own data and learn about what everything means or do you just believe every little thing that’s posted in an open online forum? Again, you have to decide. 

Stay healthy and stress free folks! It’s just money (he says looking at a huge gme loss and crying)",2021-02-06 11:43:19

So lets talk about couple of things.  


1. Stimulus Checks: Did everyone here forget that there are stimulus checks coming in next couple weeks? Since ya'll smooth brains have short memories, let me remind you what happened last time with stimulus check - PEOPLE BOUGHT STONKS. So what you think is gonna happen this time around? Yeah u guessed it, STONKS. Most of the smooth brains are gonna throw that money into GME to avg down on it. Why? Because we all like the fucking stock.Last time we saw stimulus checks of $600 and we all know what happened to stocks like tesla/apple etc and those are not even small companies. Now we have $1400 stimulus checks coming in, and that is very likely to blow up stocks like GME. Dont take my word for it, here's [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/01/21/1400-stimulus-checks-will-blow-up-the-stock-market/?sh=6a7c7b8c48d8) article on why stimulus money will blow up stock market.  

2. Paper hands are gone. They have been torn apart, burned to the ground and most of them are cursing themselves for falling into fomo because they thought they can make quick easy money. Well surprise motherfucker, you're up against the most ruthless people in financial world and this was never gonna be this easy. But the good news is that we are left with ones with true diamond hands. No matter where the price goes, these motherfuckers are not giving up.   

3. Lets not forget why the momentum was broken - yeah because of Robinfuckinghood. And that pissed many people off and many immediately started a process of switching brokers. If you remember last Friday, TD/Fidelity customer service were busy as fuck. I imagine most of it was due to the fact that many Robinhood clients wanted to transfer their accounts to them. Now that those transfers slowly going through and accounts are coming back online to trade, many will start buying more. If u liked it at $200, u should be loving it at $50.  

4. I think GME's earnings this quarter will be much better than expected. Retail traders favouring to shop at GME because we own the fucking business now is one reason and another obvious reason is how much free publicity they got. I don't have any data on this so if there are any GME employees that can shed light on how business is doing that would be great.

Position: 100 at $72 and will be adding as price moves lower. 💎💎💎🖐🖐🖐🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2) All while interest rates are at virtually zero,  our government has printed more money this last year than we have in the last 100 years, they are pushing $15/hour min. wage, politically there is a greater divide than ever before and one party is beginning to shut another down entirely, government spending is so much more recklass than ever before.

The case for holding GME and the case against it,11,ldmisv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldmisv/the_case_for_holding_gme_and_the_case_against_it/,14,1612603077.0,"This entire thing has been crazy. And this sub is different than it used to be, and it will probably never come back. Anyways... 


The entire reason to hold GME is the short squeeze. And this revolves around 2 things: 

1). The amount of shares short sold 

2). The amount of shares being held by retail investors, and so are not on the market being traded. 


We have no idea the true values for either of these things. For 1, we have estimates that vary wildly and everyone will follow their own biases on what they decide. And for 2, we will never know but there is good reason to believe as of today, february 5th, its a lesser portion than it was last wednesday-friday. So people holding GME are gambling on these 2 unknown values being in a good proportion to drive the price up. 


The only real reason i can see that would say the amount of shares shorted is still very high is this: 


Why/when do investors short a stock? When they think it is going down. We all know that by now. So when these hedge funds shorted at $5 or $10, oh yea they were making a risky ass move and paid for it. But what stopped them from covering these and shorting again at $200, or $300, or $400? They probably did, at least to some degree. And theyre well in the money with these shorts.  And they also could have closed these shorts as the stock price fell and continued to go down. Over and over again. 


So right now, short interest or the amount of shares shorted might not really matter. It may be really high but you dont know at what price they shorted, and it could be very high. I think this is much more likely than them keeping their original shorts they had before all this.

GME is Still Worth Holding Even if there isn’t Another Squeeze.,23,ldnywl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldnywl/gme_is_still_worth_holding_even_if_there_isnt/,11,1612607841.0,"After all that’s been said and done, you’re just apart of me I can’t let go. TLDR at bottom. 

Regarding GME, worst case scenario is that the shorts report on the 9th and it all goes tits up. Whatever, maybe we don’t get 10k a share. Doesn’t change the fact that it was a solid play. The rules got turned off on us and no one saw that coming. Crazy volatility ensues. That’s why silver went up btw. Because people thought the market was insolvent and wanted to stack precious medal just in case the market exploded - there is money to be made off the panic, but I digress. Let’s say we missed the ship, This doesn’t change the fact that if you’re in now, there’s still reason to hold  GME. 

The GME stock craze was like an adult tickle me Elmo phenomenon. America loves this shit, and we need a national feel good narrative now more than ever. The story alone  is worth enough to have two movies already in production about it. A corporate underdog movie of this magnitude has never been done before. It’s gonna make GameStop iconic. 
GameStop HAS to survive now. It’s too marketable to lose. 
It’s not out of the question for GME to have a comparable value to let’s say,  TTWO which is a $200 stock in the video game industry. Depending on how they capitalize on their new situation. I’d have to imagine that GameStop has a few new options available now. 
GameStop could pivot to streaming or some shit and change the face of Videogaming into the future. 
They could build an E-sports stadium or build a  team that will be worth what the Yankees are worth in 2031. 

I’m just saying, video games are only getting bigger and are at the forefront of technology and GameStop is an important Institution. 
I don’t think America wants to see another Blockbuster situation. I just like the stock I guess. 

This is obviously stupid and it’s important to know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just a silly little stink that loves pudding. 

TLDR: GME could capitalize off of national sentiment and organically earn a $400 a share value.... eventually.",2021-02-06 12:37:21

Never tell someone you know irl about your investments. If you loose money, people are assholes. ""I told you blabla"". If you make gains, people are also assholes. They are envy because you made it and they dont. Either way, ive learned, just keep it for yourself whatever you do.  
  
I told 1 person, he should buy gme (monday 2 weeks ago). We both bought at 95.00. He sold to early. Then he bought again at 300. Also he told like 5 persons they should buy the stock to. All of them lost, while i made a life changing gain.  
  
Now they all hate me. They are to dumb to make their own dd or they have no balls or whatever. But they blame me now. 
  
My conclusion is: i will never tell someone again something about stocks. I am a suit guy, i sell life insurances for a living since many years. A negative feedback from a costumer is rare for me, very rare. But when people loose money on a stock, they will blame you for it. They will blame you and it will never be the same again with those people.  
  
I love you all for beeing retarded autist apes. Thank you for changing my life in a positive way. Im still holding 250 shares of gme btw.

Went into a huge depression, tried to win it all back just as fast, but continued to go up and down. mostly down , until July solidifying a  50-70k loss across different accounts.

Continuing... Say a month goes by, it’s now worth $6 (6 x 100 = $600) so now I sell the option call and I doubled my money... right? I’m done?

Ok let’s go scenario 2... Stock drops.. $2 (2 x 100 = $200) I sell the option, do my losses equal $300-200 = $100 in losses?

Is that basically it? Or am I totally lost? Also I can sell my option at any time before expiration? Also what happens when I hit expiration?

They attempted to change their formula and the way they represent short interest data after likely receiving a hefty lump sum from Melvin and Company.

Anyways...I compiled a list of their data they so 'kindly' gave to us and took a little deeper dive into what's going on so here it is:

https://i.imgur.com/3RU6rYg.png

S3 is literally pulling numbers out of their ass at this point and they can't be trusted. It's mathematically impossible for the shorts to have covered their positions.

If there's enough interest, I'll make a copy of this data and post it here so that you guys can fuck around with the numbers to see what you can make of it.

#TL;DR

S3 are CNBC shills who post fake data. Shorts haven't covered yet, mathematically impossible. Diamond hands, the squeeze can still be squoze.

Not only for vegetarians but anyone looking for healthier options to add to their everyday life. Impossible Foods is their main competition here, but I believe there’s more than enough room in this growing industry for both companies and I’d buy into both if I could. 

•Powerful partnerships: Pepsi, Yum Brands, Del Taco, and likely McDonalds soon. Beyond is also in countless smaller restaurants around the country and soon the world. 

•More than just burgers. Remember when there was just 1 or 2 plant based milk options at the grocery store? Now there’s rows and rows of almond and oat milk variants. Same will happen with meat substitutes but in an even bigger way.

•Shorts to bust. Analysts have taken the wrong side on Beyond by failing to see the bigger picture. This will cost them.

•It’s a ‘virtue stock’. Retail investors increasingly like to buy stocks that are in line with their values. Beyond is a double whammy with both ecological and animal rights benefits.

•Covid has stalled Beyond’s progress, mainly because restaurant sales are down, but I believe this has provided a great buying opportunity before this stock goes to the moon and doesn’t come back🚀

How to sue the hedge funds (Repost #1),12,ldoit5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldoit5/how_to_sue_the_hedge_funds_repost_1/,17,1612609756.0,"Preface, I'm not a lawyer, don't message me gahdamnit.

First start by googling ""Securities Lawyer"". Find one in your area if you can, otherwise find one that's fairly close. Don't be shy, and don't self-reject. Some of them may tell you no, but you can be sure almost every lawyer in the country is dry humping their phone waiting for your phone call so that they can get their name on this guaranteed resume booster.

Once you find a securities lawyer, you will want to contact them. Use their form, and let them know a why you are contacting them.

1. You are wanting to sue for Market Manipulation, Potential Fraud, Potential Losses, Harmful Disinformation, Defamation, and Damages. (that should get you started in the right direction).
   1. Let them know how many shares you have / had, and tell them your losses will be calculated based on the price of the shares when you believe the market manipulation happened ($518)
2. You will be hard pressed to find a lawyer that doesn't want in on this, so make sure you calculate the following two ways of paying for their services with that in mind.
   1. Pay their lawyer fees. This is the way. If you can afford doing it this way, you will avoid paying them a percentage. Plus, in your law suit you can sue for lawyer fees and these hedge hogs will have to pay all of that for you.
   2. Contingency Fee. This is the one you go for if you can not afford the upfront cost of lawyer fees. This one means the lawyers get nothing from you, but take a percentage of your winnings (if you win). Typical fee is 30%-40%, but due to the nature and national attention of this lawsuit, I'd say you try to negotiate them down to like 10%. This one isn't all bad though, it really gives them incentive to win for you.
3. Do your research. There is another Law Suit by [www.garycarlinlaw.com](https://www.garycarlinlaw.com/) and you can google ""Gary Carlin Law"" and find a ton of articles about it. Use this to your advantage, and make sure in your lawsuit you sue every mother fucker that guy is suing. Also, feel free to hop on any class action lawsuit you see. They don't pay well, but ape together strong. Hop on Gary's class action.

That's all you need to know to get started. I fully expect the mods to remove this, or the bot to remove this, or the SEC / FBI to show up at my door. But I don't give a fuck, I'm squeaky clean and I'll just add all those names to my lawsuits. I'm not a lawyer, but I have sued the living dogshit out of malpractice a few times.

His wife Amber Heard, who the star married six years ago, alleged 14 incidents of assault by her ex-husband in the case. While now Depp and his legal team are set to receive an oral hearing in March as they seek to appeal the court's decision.

After losing the case, Warner Bros asked Depp to resign his role of the villain Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts series of films, which he accepted.

The star had only shot one scene for the third movie, with Mads Mikkelsen replacing him in the Harry Potter prequels.

Meanwhile, supporters of Depp have been wondering if he'll be able to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 and beyond.

Well according to The Hollywood Reporter, producer Jerry Bruckheimer wanted the 57-year-old to at least cameo in the upcoming Margot Robbie-led spin-off, but allegedly Disney balked at the idea.

Nevertheless, Depp's fans have been right behind him in calls for the star to be reinstated as Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

Everyone here is saying s3 changed their formula, as well as other sites. There's a general consent that [its very possible] hedge funds using dirty tactics to also make it look like they've covered when they couldn't possibly. As there simply wasn't enough volume and upward stock movement to cover. 

If they can't manipulate or misrepresent the nasdaq results, then they should be very aware of the high possibility the stock will rebound on Feb 9-10. So unless they cover their positions on Monday (which is VERY last minute) they're going to be paying way way more to cover than it is now. On top of that, I'm expecting the volume / price on Monday to go up, as many people are similarly speculating  possibility of GME making a comeback with the Short news.

However, if they can manipulate or misrepresent the NASDAQ listings, it would make a lot more sense: as a lot of people are holding onto the stock for the Feb 9 results. If that happens, I imagine they would cover on the 11-12 after the price drops 

What are your thoughts on the matter?

EFTs and basic industry standards for morons,35,ldrfx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrfx8/efts_and_basic_industry_standards_for_morons/,20,1612620882.0,"Hey scrubs, financial advisor here. I will not disclose the firm I work at, but regularly do business with just about all of the big ones, including Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan, and more. None of what follows is advice, but education for the unwashed masses who keep asking the same questions over and over that I'm tired of seeing, all over WSB and the other investing subreddits. Here are some basics on settlements, linking bank accounts, EFTs, wires, and transfers to/from institutions.

**EFTs and linking bank accounts**

1. When attempting to link a bank account to a new account at your broker of choice, the firm will attempt to establish contact with your bank and confirm that the account exists and that it belongs to you. If the bank has the infrastructure in place to verify this digitally, your link will be instant. As a result, big banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo should instantly link and allow you to transfer funds.
2. If the link is not instant, your bank was unable to verify immediately. This is common for credit unions, small banks, and is about 50/50 for the online banks. They simply do not have the infrastructure in place to instantly verify. A good broker will now require you to upload proof that the account is yours - generally a voided check or bank statement. This is a security measure to protect you idiots, and you should be grateful for it. IMPORTANT: If needing to submit documents as proof, this will normally take up to 3 business days to approve. However, as it is the busy season for brokers (see the bottom note on this post), it's likely that their back offices are overwhelmed and it may take longer. Pick a different bank if you have a problem with this.
3. EFTs typically process within 3 business days, or 72 hours. If this is a NEW relationship with a broker and you make a larger transfer, the very first transfer may take longer, generally up to 10 business days. Once again, this is a security measure to protect against fraud. Subsequent transfers will now adhere to the 3 business day rule in most cases, barring extenuating circumstances.
4. If you're desperate, you should be able to locate wire information for your broker. You can now wire funds directly to your brokerage account for instant settlement.

**Wires for dummies**

Bank wires generally settle instantly or very quickly (within minutes) IF YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

Process the fucking wire before 4pm EST, because that's when the central banks start to close. If you process close to 4pm or after, it will settle on a best efforts basis, which usually means the next morning. Don't be an idiot.

Also keep in mind that many firms charge a fee to send a wire, but some do not. I know of a few that do not charge to send or receive wires, but I'm not here to advise or tell you idiots where to go with your money.

**Transfer of assets (TOA) via the ACATS system**

1. ACATS is the system by which most brokerage firms can transfer shares back and forth without selling. Doing so requires you to have an account of the same registration at the receiving firm to the one at the contrafirm that will be sending the shares. Roth IRA to Roth IRA, taxable brokerage to taxable brokerage.
2. Most assets, particularly ETFs, individual equities, and bonds will transfer in-kind. Most mutual funds as well. Be sure to verify that you do not hold any institutional mutual funds before transferring, as they may be required to be sold. This isn't a big deal in a tax-deferred account, but can screw you over in a taxable one. Penny stocks are accepted on a firm-by-firm basis, so be sure to check your firms rules. Again, this is to protect your stupid asses.
3. Initiating a TOA is done on the receiving firms end and generally requires you to upload a statement from the contrafirm dated within the last six months which shows your account registration, number, your name, and the positions within the account. Settlement is generally 7-10 business days, but often process as quickly as 3-5, if you're transferring between large firms.
4. If your cost basis and metadata doesn't show right away, sit the fuck down and chill out. It will follow within a few business days most of the time, but can take up to a full month, depending on firm. E-Trade is notorious for being slow about their metadata. 
5. A full account TOA will result in the receiving firm ""sweeping"" the old account for a month. Residual balances, cash, dividends, and more will sweep over. If you still have a balance after a month, simply initiate a new TOA.
6. Most firms will not require paperwork for an ACATS transfer, but if you must fill some out, it's because the contrafirm wants a signature for whatever reason. Stupid, but sometimes necessary to move on with your life. If you're charged a transfer fee by the contrafirm and are actually transferring real money and not the lunch money your mom gave you, call the new broker and request that it be reimbursed. If your new broker has local branches, start there - you'll have less of a wait time and will likely get to speak with a senior planner, but they're generally only open during normal business hours.

**DTC transfers**

DTC transfers are not as common as TOAs via the ACATS system, but are sometimes necessary. If needed, check with your receiving firm to acquire their DTC number, then call your current firm to request the DTC transfer. You'll need your new firm's information, your new account number, and the new firms DTC number handy.

**Basic customer support availability**

1. The busiest times for brokerage firms are at the end of the tax year and the beginning of the new year through tax time. The reason for this is that many clients who have actual money - which excludes most of you - have tax-related items to address and typically put it off until the last second. For end of year, this includes last-minute tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving strategies, required minimum distributions, retirement account contributions, and more. For the new year, it can be some of the same but, more often than not, is all of the planning, money movement, and close-of-business that clients put off during the holidays and now want to address in the new year.

2. This means that your hold times are likely to be long, so be nice to your goddamn reps and try calling before market open, before lunch, or early afternoon. Around the open, lunch time, and just after normal business hours are typically the worst times to try and get through. If you have an advisor in a 1:1 capacity, they may or may not be able to help you ""skip the queue"", but may or may not be available themselves. Also note that while many of these firms offer 24/7 support and service, many teams are only available during certain business hours. Generally advisors/planners, specialist teams, etc. Ex - you wanna talk to your firm's strategy desk after market close? Tough shit, they're probably gone.

These are some of the basics. Ask away if you have questions, but I'm drinking now and can't speak for the quality of responses.",2021-02-06 16:14:42

Public announcement,54,ldr67u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldr67u/public_announcement/,32,1612619729.0,"Ok so there’s a couple things I would like to say to those that have recently joined this sub thinking it’s the Alaskan gold rush.
1. When you win, please be great full. I know I’m no og but for those of us that have been here prior to the GME craze understand when to be happy about a win. If you make money you should be happy. No it’s ands or buts, you have a dollar that you didn’t have before be grateful for god sake.
2. To the losers (not in a negative tone). If you thought the market was going to be easy and just print money for you I am truly sorry to burst your bubble. If things where that easy then everyone would be rich. You may think that you are special so you can win in this game. Well hate to break it to you, you may be special but not special enough to win in this game.
3. UNDERSTANDING: be aware that the market has ups and downs. Panic is not the answer. Some days your up some days your down. If you want to succeed in the game you need to be persistent but not naive. Understand when a loss is a loss but don’t get to trigger happy.
4. Everyone has won and everyone has lost don’t think your special because you just so happened to be on either side. 
5. LASTY: if you have taken a large loss, remain calm. Everything will be ok! I’m not telling you to double down but I’m not saying to quit. You need to evaluate your financial position and make an educated decision on whether or not to continue. If you have lost greatly, sometimes it’s best to take a break and revaluate at a later time. DONT WORRY YOU WILL BE OK!

Synopsis: it’s a dangerous game. Have fun, be safe and make smart decisions that will benefit you in the long run. Know when to take profits or when to call it quits. Good luck to all!",2021-02-06 15:55:29

Most recent $GME Short Interest data according to S3 Partners puts shorts at an average short of just $53 a share as of 2/5,51,ldqzgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldqzgr/most_recent_gme_short_interest_data_according_to/,59,1612618928.0,"Please bear with me, as this is my first post here after reading a thousand posts over the past month or so.  HODLing 120 shares of $GME, I am not a financial professional, definitely don't buy on my advice alone, do your own DD.  

As we all know, finding accurate short interest data is hard to come by.  By the time the official numbers are released (coming this Tuesday 2/9!) it is too late, as they are for almost 2 weeks prior.  As such, we have to rely on estimates of the data.  One of the companies providing those estimates is S3 Partners.  Many of us here have very mixed opinions about them, and my own is still being decided.  

Regardless, if the information they are providing is any way accurate, it gives us a sense of what price the shorts are in at, which is a huge factor at play.  If they had covered earlier, and then shorted the stock at 350 a share?  Bad news for us.  However, it appears this is not the case!  Read on, those of you that can.  Have a banana for those of you who cannot.

2 days ago, the twitter face of S3's data, Ihor Dusaniwsky tweeted this:

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357352226507915265](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357352226507915265)

"" [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) short interest is $2.39BN; 25.86M shs shorted; 50.68% SI % Float; 33.63% S3 SI % Float; 11% borrow fee and rising. Shs shorted have decreased by -36.2M over the last week. Shorts are down -$8.68BN in 2021, which includes up +$437M on today's -18% move.""

Now I'm no expert, but a dollar amount on the short interest, coupled with the number of shares, should give us an estimate of the average dollar amount that shares are being shorted at, right?  If I short 100 shares at $10 apiece, my short interest is $1000, no?  Well, take that $2.39BN and 25.86M shares shorted the other day, and you get $92.42.  Which makes sense, because he goes on to say that they are up $437M on Thursday, as the stock was down 18% at the time and the numbers work out.  

Likewise, he tweets again the day tomorrow, 2/5, with similar data, BUT one big difference.  The number of shares shorted is barely changed, however the short interest is only $1.38BN now.  Read:

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357720599699849217](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1357720599699849217)

"" [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) short interest is $1.36BN; 25.40M shs shorted; 49.77% SI % Float; 33.23% S3 SI % Float; 8.83% borrow fee. Shs shorted have decreased by -32.4M over the last week. Shorts are down -$8.48BN in 2021, which includes down -$368M on today's +27% move to $68.""

And much like the day before, the numbers add up!  They lost $368M because the stock rose from $54 to what he was seeing at the time, $68ish, and 25.4M shares shorted times $14 apiece is a loss of $368M.  Furthermore, it lines up with the price they are now shorted at, which was $53.54 a share ($1.36B/25.4M shares).  

&#x200B;

Okay, if you're still with me, and I'm totally off base here, let me know.  I'm actually not a true believer in a short squeeze still happening. However I am a true believer in not allowing hedge funds to short a company to oblivion.  They are neither fraudulent nor in financial difficulties, they have new leadership and a path forward, and while one could argue what the true price of their stock should be, you could say that about half of the speculative stocks that exist in the market today.  

Anyway, thanks for reading, looking for additional data that you may provide in the comments below rather than the recent twitch chat spamfest of the past few weeks.",2021-02-06 15:42:08

Nancy pelosi’s som is a big investor.        To the fucking moon 

American Battery Metals Corp (OTCQB: ABML) CEO Doug Cole joined Steve Darling from Proactive with news the company has been awarded a $4.5 million grant by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office. The grant is part of the DOE’s effort to reduce the US’s dependence on critical materials by aiding American companies.

Cole says what's more, the commercial pilot pilot will produce 20,000 tons of recycled battery metals, translating to $200M in revenues. Cole adds the group will work towards producing 200,000 tons. The company completed three key milestones regarding its pilot recycling plant located in Fernley, Nevada. The company announced that it purchased the land at 345, Winston Lane in Fernley where ABMC will build five buildings as part of the campus.

Additionally, the company also managed to clinch the crucial water rights for the plant.

It is a major development for ABMC since the company will be able to operate its pilot plant at full tilt for many years without any scarcity of water.

Last but not the least; the company also revealed that it appointed the services Miles Construction to be the designer and contractor for the pilot plant.",2021-02-06 15:39:58

GME and future of WSB ?,332,ldqva1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldqva1/gme_and_future_of_wsb/,102,1612618421.0,"Fellow retards,

I have a couple points I'd like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I'm not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.

I've been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn't make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.

WSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.

However, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It's what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a ""movement"". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 4.2069% Now we cannot hear them due to noise.

Now, the sub is filled with people who just yell ""HOLD!!!!!"" ""BUY MORE"" ""WHO HOLDS????"" ""GME WILL GO TO MOON"". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.

A hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of ""WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME"" I'd love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won't help US.

I wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I'd be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don't get new info. We don't get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.

We need to find our next GMEs. That's how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.

tl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES. Otherwise GME can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make TENDIES

Melvin will go bankrupt, sure, but they're a pretty small fish, it seems excessive to do all this manipulation to save a fledging hedge fund unless the brokers, DTCC, maybe even the entire market is under threat, causing the coordinates attacks we're seeing in an effort to diffuse this.

Coming back from RONA, I believe that airline companies have the unprecedented opportunity to recover drastically from the pandemic and make a MOONFULL of profits after successful rollout of the vaccine. 

Points:

- United Airlines is already delivering large quantities of vaccine from overseas, and partners with Clorox to keep their planes squeaky (1)

- AA has expanded domestic and international testing for its passengers to make travel seamless to highly popular leisure destinations, and announcing more promising data from 2020 seeing less losses than expected (2)


- Delta Airlines has stated that they will keep middle seats blocked until the end of March, and they have kept their daily cash flown burn to about $10mil a day (just think what their profits will do when they open up that middle seat) (3/4) 

- Southwest Airlines unfortunately has posted its first loss in the company’s HISTORY, but stands to profit off of losses as leisure travel still dominates (which is their whole operation). Also, they continue to shift focus on opening new destinations across the United States DURING RONA (5)

- Frontier and Spirit Airlines are making enough profit to continue their pilot hiring, which in turn, leads to more flights being flown (6)

All said and done, people WILL want to keep traveling after this is said and done. Airlines stand to make MAD MONEY profit as flight loads from not only shipping the vaccine, but filling up with leisure travelers starts happening *best case scenario* late Q2 or mid Q3 (you can already see this as big airlines are flying fuller large wide body jets to places like Florida and Mexico). 

Loss to riches all in to JETS baby, let’s make that comeback COME BACk! I’ll be going in every paycheck until I can post that YOLO flair.

Numbers don't lie. If you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole GME thing was probably engineered by hedge funds (Citadel & SAC) to suck in retail. Retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell GME for $300.,5,ldpjo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpjo4/numbers_dont_lie_if_you_look_at_who_made_money/,35,1612613353.0,"Citadel has access to Robinhood's order flow, their whole business model is to front run you, so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar? After the ""squeeze"" Melvin received fresh capital, they never got squeezed. WSB lost money. This was probably a set up by SAC & Citadel to squeeze retail with GME. While everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to Wall street someone else was unloading worthless GME shares for $300. Then they continued from $300 down to $50 while WSB was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more, adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting.

In the end you guys became famous and lost money, while hedge funds made money but were *humiliated*.

Well for days I've emailed and requested access they don't respond. The issue was somehow they fd a deposit and cause it to be blocked. On the first day after they deactivated they put me in a margin call(of course). So my $5000 portfolio only had $4000 to cover investments. I attempted to deposit cash countless times to cover the $1000. Well today they sold all GME and AMC assets(even though I have 2 others that weren't sitting @80% loss that could have been sold to more than cover) so now I have no GME and lost most AMC @ +80% loss. Then what do you know the option to reactive was given literally in the window where the Margin call appeared IMMEDIATELY after the margin call. 

TL DR: 
RH fucked up a bank transfer

RH then deactivated and put cash backed shares on margin(with no ability to reactivate)

RH then did a margin call

RH sold +80% losses

RH immediately gave option to reactivate after sell.


RH is actually a fucking scam. They play so fucking dirty.

Edit: because I think you guys are missing my point. THEY DEACTIVATED THE ACCOUNT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO COVER UNTIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER SELLING.

$CHGG (Cheating Chegg) Puts--A Decent Opportunity,26,ldpc2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg_cheating_chegg_putsa_decent_opportunity/,21,1612612586.0,"I got most of the answers for this DD from some Indian guy on Chegg, and copied them word for word.

Alright, so Chegg has recently broke the $100 wall and has nicely ran up to an ATH before its earnings after market close on Monday.

I believe that it's going to tank immediately after earnings. Why? Well, obviously their subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers are going to be great. Hell, everyone's been cheating with Chegg lately, paying $15 a month to access shitty homework answers.

Nonetheless, they released similar spectacular numbers in October 2020, and immediately tanked from 87 to 77. Why? Because back then, they foresaw their growth slowing down in 2021. The slowing growth projections caused them to tank in the short term before recovering.

Recent earnings from Unity ($U) and Peloton ($PTON), for example, are showing that even with stellar profits, PERFECT future guidance is important right now. Both of those ran up to earnings. Both nose-dived right after. And with Chegg diving on its last 2 run-ups to earnings, I don't see why this time will be any different.


TL;DR:

Chegg is running up to an all-time high before earnings. The reopening of schools in the somewhat-near future will probably provide a slight damper to its growth projections. Last 2 earnings tanked from ATH's for the same reason. Recent earnings like Unity and Peloton show even slightly toned-down growth projections tank the stock despite good profits. A put debit spread is the way to go with this one.


Positions:

$CHGG 2/19 100/105 Put Debit Spread for $260 (selling 2/19 $100P, buying 2/19 $105P)


You could also YOLO the 2/19 $90P for $200. If the stock tanks, it's probably going to at least $90. If it soars, well, the puts are fucked anyway.",2021-02-06 13:56:26
Change of dialect. Will wsb speak with a new tongue?,5,ldpbzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpbzk/change_of_dialect_will_wsb_speak_with_a_new_tongue/,30,1612612577.0,"This really is a humorous place. I just read how some one complained that we don’t call our selves retarted now instead we are apes strong. 

I have a problem with this.

 Before I ever joined wsb I had dumped thousands in penny stocks for 300% gain but would have been happy taking 10% instead of -70%. 

Then I started buying FD’s before knowing what they were. You know $20 calls for GE and Ford . Don’t get me started with tsla weeklies especially before the split. You know when you could think of getting rich buying a $2000 call option when tsla was $9-1200

Anyways I said to my self that I was dumb as shit and it was clear when it came to the market I was “retarted” 

I don’t think it really echoed to my personal life that it was that stupid but it was great reflection of self. Maybe the way I trade stocks is really the reason I’m fucked up in life. 

Idk but I would still continue to buy fd’s the following Monday. And if I lost which of course I did I could come here and laugh with the community. Be happy someone else was a worst trader then me or just more naive. 

This is a great group with a certain type of risk takers that is unlike any thing I’ve ever seen. And yes majority of these risk are on fd’s that will never print but the beauty is when we count up potential profits. In our minds we have came up with the recipe for success. Unfortunately we just picked the wrong expy and striker. Who would of thought.

Yet we can spit more game on premium then the herd mentality who’ve never even had nuts to invest or trade rather, investing is easy (Hence the 401k)

In close I hope the language of this place stays the same. I don’t want to go to another wallstreetbets make up. That would be weird. It would be equally weird to watch this place change how we discuss topics.

I’ve been here for almost a year. I don’t know if it’s just the way you speak when your on Reddit but this sub has a certain way you speak where it just clicks with a certain side of your mental. Either it’s your or not and you get it or not. Only a certain type of people can laugh at smooth brain jokes and relate. 

What do you think? If we stop calling our selves retards and we view are losses in a more politically correct way will we stop trying to hit it big. Since the conservative approach is 10-15% a year?

Edit** I may have worded something wrong. I like being a retard I know that I will be smarter one day and make better decisions. Right now I’m still trying to figure out why my gme calls for March 5 300 and 350 will make or not",2021-02-06 13:56:17

I find it useful for any that are giving into negativity by the hands that give hand-jobs with the quality grip of paper, to realise GME is not just a mere speculative bubble anymore but a plausible and prosperous business model with longevity in mind. Here is an extract from a research paper of what to think about while you hold with those diamond hands of yours. If you must get further approval from your wife’s boyfriend then do so but make your own choices.

“Although the years-long short thesis implies a terminal value of zero (bankruptcy), we see this outcome as virtually impossible given the current state of GameStop’s financials, incoming console revenue, and proven ecommerce results trajectory. In fact, our analysis clearly shows
3 distinct paths to profitability:

• A Bear Case ($32.00) tracking the existing “GameStop Reboot” initiative, with successful footprint rationalization to 2,000 stores in North America by 2023, steady ecommerce contribution, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.

• A Base Case ($80.00) that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.

• A Bull Case ($169.00) based on a full transition by 2025 to the ecommerce- first “cultural gaming hub” hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with a significant increase in revenue attributed to ecommerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.”

I'd like to get everyone together to confirm their experiences and how we are going to get our issues resolved. Any issue at all.

I moved my account out of RH last week and my shares and options showed up after 5 days, but along came a 4000 dollar debit which I can't explain. I'm now on margin with my new broker who also doesn't know what this charge is. Come Monday I'll start paying interest on some margin I never had. My RH account had margin disabled and was just shares, a few options, and a little bit of cash. Where's the 4k from? Where's the 700 from that this poor mook in /r/robinhood is missing? Where's the 2k the other one is missing?

I saw posts on /r/robinhood and /r/robinhoodtrades that aren't going to get traction because they're tiny subs and the mods there don't want any discussion except for gains threads. Fuck em. Post on WSB. There's 8 million retards here that make up a large portion of RH's clients.

RH does not have a phone number to call. Put in an email on their support page, tell everyone here, tweet them, email them again, complain wherever you want. If we can't get answers, we're going to file with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We're going to tweet Vlad and he can reply from jail.

Fuck Robinhood. You owe me 4000 dollars, whatever was in cash at time of transfer which you haven't given me a statement on, all the money from any liquidated partial shares and whatever percentage on margin I end up owing to TDA. I'm gonna get my fucking money. Cuz I want my margin cleared up so I can buy more meme stocks.",2021-02-06 16:50:35

Stop with the ape crap.,143,ldrwvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrwvl/stop_with_the_ape_crap/,129,1612622963.0,"It’s in your best interest to stop acting like a bunch of dumb sheep who bought GME simply because they were following WSB, DFV, or the crazy FOMO price action. 

That stupid ape narrative will only be used to “protect you” with more trading restrictions for the lower classes. Think of the part time day trading rules, which make it harder to make money, but worse. 

If you’re new here, “apes together strong” was never a thing until the last couple weeks. It showed up with all the new people (bots?). Before then, we called people retards, not as a sign of strength in numbers, but to make fun of people that think they understand the market and get burned. 

I mean, yeah, it’s a joke about us being dumb. But along with loss porn, it’s a reminder to fucking be careful. Anything could happen. Use risk management.

This is a fucking casino. You could be right about some stupid stock going up 5% tomorrow. Or the whole god damned market could crash, and you’ll just be another loser down 20%, regardless of your amazing DD. 

We all know the risks. 

So don’t whine about losing all your money. Don’t ask for handouts on this sub, because you risked more than you could lose. More than anything, stop acting like ignorance makes you strong. It never did. 

It’s your money. You made grown up decisions. Own your losses. Don’t let legislation take more freedoms away from us within the “free market” to protect us, the ‘poor dumb apes.’

WSB is being scapegoated for this fiasco, even though many of us had good reasons to invest in GME. The thing that wasn’t accounted for by most people was the sudden restriction on buying for multiple days until all momentum died. The ability for brokers to abruptly make that decision needs to be challenged.

So pull yourself together and do some research about the way brokers created an artificial selling pressure to push the price down. Then, maybe contact your state representatives with something more coherent than diamond hands and ape noises.

It wasn't a gamma squeeze because it is NOT the same as the $VW stock.  Because in that case, Porche owned like 80% of the shares, and Porche it's a UNIT, it's a company, 1 person can coordinate it. But because we are a lot of people and you can NEVER know what someone will do, especially on the internet. It probably won't happen again. If you really want to see something happening you should take all the stocks talked about here in some order and take some profits from each of them. Because I feel like the other stocks didn't squeeze, not even once. They look like some P&Ds. If you really wanted to squeeze again $GME, you would probably have to go with it again to 500$ and actually hold. But such a run up again doesn't seem feasible in my view.

When i noticed the weirdest thing. 

Out of no where i had a share show up for GME. And the account claimed it was negative 600 something. 

Stranger still, it was on Margin.  I thought Margin bad, so i haven't bought one on Margin. But again, i haven't bought one period on fidelity yet there it was...

Well, now, the share and the account are gone / zero. Just like when this all started.

RH still has all my shares though... and i can't buy or sell them because my account is deactivated while the transfer is pending.

It always felt lopsided.  Gamestop will pay you let’s say $3 dollars for a game, then turn around and sell it for $30.

You could argue that Gamestop’s cost of managing inventory justifies the markup.  This did not change anything for me as a customer.  I turned to eBay instead.  I felt I got a truer market value with my exchanges.  Now even though I always bought and never sold on eBay a seller gets the most profits, not eBay.  An individual seller benefiting the most.  Power to the players Gamestop, don’t forget!

Hopefully the buyer got a truer market value as well instead of a set price that probably doesn’t sell until it goes on sale or worse clearance.  Potentially wasting resources required by Gamestop to manage the inventory and floor space.

If Gamestop could eliminate this obstacle, now that I’m diamond FUCKING hands, I could see myself using Gamestop for my used video game exchanges.  Even selling this time.  I could see how Gamestop could use it’s store fronts and name recognition (ape t-shirts anyone??) to leverage itself as the premier destination for the used gaming market to even rival eBay.  Well it fucking better or I’m never getting my tendies.

Now onto the stuff I absolutely loved about Gamestop as a customer.  Midnight motherfucking launches.  Battlefield 3, Destiny, The Order 1886.  I think it was just those three but I had a blast.

You can argue it’s all digital now so the days of actually having to go to the store is done but at the moment, the used market is limited to physical.  Some folks also just prefer physical media.  I know I feel this way about books.

And that’s it unfortunately.  I still love gaming, since the Atari 2600.  I just now purchase digitally so I don’t have to worry about the literal baggage but I think physical media will always have a place.  I still have my N64 and Dreamcast.  Maybe if the conditions are right, I’d even let go of my beloved Dreamcast collection in very good used condition with four controllers fishing rod arcade stick and two official light guns.

The 1% is primarily made up of the descendants of the shareholders of Gamestop before the stock went parabolic for the fifteenth time. 

After it was clear no one was selling, the share price hit $24,000 in 2021. Then continued on a divine ascent for the next 2 years, topping 3.5 billion a share. 

Still the share holders did not sell. 

It was at this time, GameStop decided to do something incredible. They released a 10,000 share offering. The shorts being forced to buy back in now that stocks were available instantly made GameStop the most valuable company in the world by millions of times any other competitor. GameStop then immediately bought every business in the world and announced a 1% quarterly dividend. 

Within 10 years all holders of GameStop shares would be wealthy enough to replace not only their hands with diamonds, but also every member of their family’s as well.

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it:

Overall:
Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy.  This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25.

It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago.

BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon.  Check the chart, retard.

Upside:

BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.
So let's recap so far:

An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's ""brick and mortar"" expectations online.

Easy win play: Just buy shares if you're scared

**WTF is SGMO?** The most undervalued gene\*\*\* editing company out there, hands down. Don’t believe me? Check out this valuation table

|Company|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|
|Biomarin|15.4 Billion|
|Crispr Therapeutics|12.4 Billion|

**Hey man, your last valuation tables didn’t have DNLI, SAVA, ITCI in them…what’s up with that? You trying to make SGMO look better than it is?** I neglected to put those in, but I realized I should have because they are the other big player in the Alzheimer’s market and SGMO has a 750 Million dollar partnership with BIIB for Alzheimer’s. And yes, it does make SGMO look better considering how robust the pipeline is compared to some of the one-trick ponies. Meanwhile, you got SGMO out there in the trenches doing Alzheimer’s, hemophilia, organ transplant, CAR-T…

[The European Medicines Agency Committee for Orphan Medical Products issued a positive opinion for designating SGMO/Sanofi/Genzyme treatment for sickle cell disease as an Orphan Medicinal Product.](https://twitter.com/_B_I_O_T_E_C_H_/status/1356982267323777024?s=20) Although I’m more familiar with things on the Yankee side of the pond, I believe this is basically a statement that precedes the actual orphan drug designation, to (hopefully) be awarded when the committee meets January 19th-21st, 2021.

**What’s an Orphan Medicinal Product?** Although you could google it, I’ll just let you know it offers an easier path to approval and financial incentives for the manufacturer, since the small patient population would prevent the drug from being financially viable otherwise. Just another piece of news not reflected in the price.

**Speaking of stock price, remember ONCE from the table above?** They were acquired for 4 Billion for one approved therapy. Sidebar- a geene therapy for ocular indication was a smart strategic move because it ain’t hard to deliver to an eyeball (you inject into the eyeball and you’ve hit your target), and the biggest hurdle in geene therapy right now seems to be delivery. So they had a revenue geenerating product, and therefore should have been valued more than SGMO- makes perfect sense. What’s more interesting for us is that they also have a hemophilia A geene therapy, SPK-8011, just like SGMO. And just like Biomarin, the trial results are objectively inferior to SGMO’s. [Although the picture is tiny, you’ll have to squint at this crappy abstract page because I don’t have access to the ITSH abstracts in full.](https://abstracts.isth.org/abstract/phase-i-ii-trial-of-spk-8011-stable-and-durable-fviii-expression-for-2-years-with-significant-abr-improvements-in-initial-dose-cohorts-following-aav-mediated-fviii-gene-transfer-for-hemophilia-a/) Notice the factor levels in Phase 1/2 top out somewhere below 25 IU

^(In case the monke strong crowd was wondering, IU is International Units, which is a measurement of factor level normalized to the general population, where 100 IU would represent the mean factor levels of a large simple size of a non-hemophiliac patient population. Factor is weird- you really don’t need levels of 100 IU to prevent bleeds, which is good because all the geenetic therapies seem to produce levels of factor that wane over time.) 

**SGMOs Phase 1/2 factor levels went to about…ohhhh…**[***more than 100*** for those that received an extended steroid taper (see slides 11 and 12, one of those lucky bastards got up to like 175)](https://investor.sangamo.com/static-files/3238ff23-9b25-4d56-b16c-f603cc6c63e0). KILLIN IT. Of note, Truist issued a “Quick Thoughts” report on Dec 8th with a price target of $23 for SGMO following these results, and it only mentioned the Heme A program results, not any of the 16 others pipeline ventures SGMO has going on. WF has a price target of $36.

**And now for something completely different:** [a patent application to edit mitochondrial genomes](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154288&pt=msg&mid=21569486) . 

**Anything coming up, event-wise?** Aside from the stuff in previous articles, [and this great timeline spaddy posts occasionally on IV,](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=154554&pt=msg&mid=21603746) SGMO usually has their full year conference call near the end of February, and they like to make big announcements around that time. FWIW, someone has been buying a LOT of February calls. Maybe SGMO is going to partner with someone diabetes-focused to treat Type 1 Diabetes, since it’s autoimmune and only a natural target for T-Cell therapy. But that’s just wild speculation I was hoping to manifest into existence.

**TL;DR** SGMO wildly undervalued, buy OTM LEAPs and shares.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings -**

Based on the report published on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-capital-employed-overview-snap-153556988.html), SNAP reported Q4 sales of $911.32 million and earnings fell to a loss of $97.24 million. This was a decrease of 42% from last quarter which is obviously good because in the last quarter they lost $167.86 million in earnings. They were also able to beat the analyst expectations of EPS by 0.02/share. This is why the stock went up 10% after the earnings. They posted strong Q4 results and were able to beat all the expectations.

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

The SNAP is little concerned over the Apple's IDFA policy and because of that they expect low revenue in the following quarter. The increase in users and revenue mainly occurred due to coronavirus pandemic. More and more companies started spending money on the social media apps to promote their products instead of Televisions or movie theatres. As coronavirus pandemic comes to an end, I expect decline in users and decline in revenues for the company. The brands would then start spending ad money on movie theatres, restaurants etc.

&#x200B;

SNAP's competitors Instagram & Facebook has also seen growth in number of users. As digital ad budget continues to grow, there's no guarantee that they would all flow to the SNAP. I personally find ads on SNAP more annoying than I do on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. I expect Facebook & Instagram to collect more ad dollars compared to Snapchat over the period of time.

&#x200B;

The stock was trading at 25$ ish during October 2020 and it went up 193% over the span of 6 months.

&#x200B;

SNAP has a good presence in developed markets, however I think it faces difficulty when trying to enter the developing countries.

&#x200B;

I also expect a little bit of pullback from the rally of 10% on Friday. I expect the stock to trade around 55$ in few upcoming weeks.

I’ve not seen a better community around and more sure fire play anywhere on this sub.  The company are open about wanting a buyout and reasonable estimates for BO start as low as 5B, giving it a share price of $35, and as high as 15B, giving a share price of $105.  

I don’t do DD (not enough chromosomes), just read others and I’d say the consensus is around the 7-10B buy out, giving it a 5-8x range by summer.

I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold. 

Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are ""paper hands"".

The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.

Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them.

Why $SPCE is due a 60%+ surge in next 10 days and HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE.,80,ldw6aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldw6aq/why_spce_is_due_a_60_surge_in_next_10_days_and/,139,1612640724.0,"$SPCE (Virgin Galactic) has been one of the best performing non-meme stocks this year and it is due to surge another +60% in the next 10 days that will precede a huge short squeeze. I will explain more below.

&#x200B;

**VIRGIN GALACTIC:**

Virgin Galactic is a space tourism company that is moments away from FAA approval which will enable it to begin commercial operations this year. Virgin Galactic sells tickets for $250,000 per person that gives you a plan ride to the edge of space and 6 minutes of weightless bouncing around in the space ship looking back at earth.

&#x200B;

**TEST FLIGHT IS THE KEY:**

February 13th marks the opening of SPCE flight window for their final 2 powered test flights to space. Weather permitting of course, this flight will take place this weekend or on the soonest perfect weather following day.

SPCE's last test flight FAILED. After the failed ignition, their plane glided safety back down to base, proving their safety systems worked as expected. After diagnosis, it was found the software responsible for igniting the rocket system had failed. Virgin Orbit also suffered a failed launch late last year due to the exact same problem.

***Why should we be excited about this test flight if the last one failed?***

Virgin Orbit since corrected the software issue and their next launch was a success! Proving the Virgin rocket engineers are capable of fixing this issue and leaving us very confident they have applied the same fix to the SPCE rocket system.

With this successful test flight, SPCE will gather all the data needed for full FAA approval needed to begin commercial operations. Let's not forget that this will not be their first successful test flight to space either!

This means the successful test flight could see Richard Brandon fly on the first commercial space flight as soon as late March.

When the stock was at $30, market analysts predicted a successful test flight could see the stock reach $54, which would equate to a +60% move.

**The stock is currently $54.+60% increase will see the stock reach $86 IN ONE DAY based on successful powered test flight.**

&#x200B;

**SHORT SQUEEZE:**

According to MarketBeat, SPCE short interest is a fantastic 71% of the float to the tune of 1.6 BILLION DOLLARS.

Many options calls expired on 5th February, meaning Monday they will likely need to buy their shares. The stock is up +22% in just the last trading week and +128% YTD. Shorts are getting very nervous.

Successful test flight will see a huge surge in price as investors flood in to the company as it moves from speculative to viable commercial operations.

With 71% float shorted, we will see an absolutely epic short squeeze when shorts will have no choice but to cover their positions once on the success of the test flight.

&#x200B;

**WHAT'S THE PLAY:**

This all comes down to the success of the test flight.

**If you are betting the test flight will be a success (as I am), get in before February 13th when the flight window opens.**

If you are betting the test flight will fail, short the stock before February 13th.",2021-02-06 21:45:24

 Its beautiful and what makes it great is we dont have a leader, we arent planning revolts, we are using an internet forum to educate people on the stock market who are then deciding, we wanna bet on the hedgefunds to fail, to fail against the will of the regular citizens banding together to decide, we had enough of your corporate greed. We arent a group, we are a mindframe and its hard to kill something that doesnt have a face.You cant extort something without a name. We are one, we are all!

MSTR - Microstrategy,0,ldvxqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldvxqz/mstr_microstrategy/,18,1612639616.0,"MSTR has alot of Rule#4, enough that their stock essentially tracks it.

It is up 340% the last 3m, 89% the last month, 31% the last week.

Call options are expensive, my only regret is I wish I had more than 4 shares @ $500. 

The only reason I would invest in MSTR is if your broker, like mine (WeBull) doesn’t allow rule#4 purchases.

MSTR will continue to rise over time, hopefully at the same pace because MSTR is a stock, and stocks only go up.

PSA to newer members of WSB.,6729,ldvw8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldvw8m/psa_to_newer_members_of_wsb/,1107,1612639416.0,"I want to clarify a few things to some newer members.  You have taken a few jokes we make seriously and it will cause you to lose money. 

First, FOMO is an extremely bad reason to buy a stock or options. If you have to every ask “is it too late?” It is too late. Don’t ever buy a stock after it has rocketed up to ATH. 

This was a very very standard but of advice until GME made it’s crazy run. Now it seems like the norm. It’s not. It never was, and it never will be. GME is a once in a lifetime run. You will very likely never see another one. 

Second, diamond hands. Pretty much the same story. Diamond hands was seen as a very very stupid thing to do. Anytime you nailed even a 2 bagger we would always always tell you to sell it all, or at the very least sell half to secure some profit and hold the other half as a gamble. 

Another note on diamond hands. If you are not familiar with organized pump and dump groups please read up on them. They create runs on a stock, then convince other people to buy it while they sell off securing profits. 

The 3 biggest ways to spot a pump and dump is 1 fomo, and 2 they tell you have diamond hands. (Prior to diamond hands they would say “it might dip, but that’s expected! Don’t sell it will go up!” Lastly they will always sell it as a sure thing. No stock is ever a sure thing. 

New people that witnessed GME are making these pump and dumps extremely easy to pull off. 


My last bit of advice, bag holding isn’t a sound strategy. Holding a stock because you are down on it and only because you are down on it is stupid. Plain and simple. 

Only ever hold on to a stock if you really think it’s going to go up. (With good reason.) you can sell, take what money is left and buy something else that will return a better profit. When you lose, ask yourself, if I didn’t own this stock right now, would I buy it at its current price having seen it drop? If the answer is yes, then hold it, if the answer is I would cum in my pants for a chance to buy in at this price having no losses! Then double the fuck down and buy more. 

I have been on wsb for almost 10 years. I learned to trade here. I don’t have a job and trade full time for my income. There are some very very smart people here, it is up to you to find those people and learn from them while ignoring or laughing at the retards losing money for the memes. 

Lastly, inverse wsb is a very legit strategy, think about that. Doing the exact opposite of the front page of wsb has good returns. (fscomeau, I’ll miss you, you glorious bastard.)


Edit: someone rightfully pointed out that the inverse wsb strategy has gotten its ass royally handed to it in the last 8 months. So maybe I’m that old guy that is struggling to keep up with change.",2021-02-06 21:23:36

To The Moonwatcher then starts to feed on all the waxy goodness he has found.

Have a sub-plot featuring gourd buying / having the boat getting delayed and the gourds slowly rotting.

Another sub-plot: a member of WSB slowly becomes more and more ill over the course of the film, and they have no idea why.

At least their stonks continue to 🚀🚀🚀, so they can still purchase wax crayons to feast on.

Have cuts / transitions using dire space-themed special effects. Eg: rockets made using painted washing up bottles, child-painted planets/ moons, etc.

The film's climax needs a 300-inspired HOLD sequence, using the most inappropriate people / cheap ape costumes.

Shouldn't Melvin go under by now?,0,ldvchr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldvchr/shouldnt_melvin_go_under_by_now/,16,1612636827.0,"I have a lot of questions about the GME short on the hedge fund side. I'm low key hoping that a former hedge fund person/insider/trading veteran will share some insight, but hey, I'll take any answer that's backed up by research.

1. How does a hedge fund stay alive after sustaining billions in losses? 

I've heard rumors of them selling their long positions to cover their shorts, having time to pay for the shares they shorted, and receiving a loan from Citadel. I'm assuming they've played both sides of the trade and took out new short positions based on recent prices.

2. If they are going under, then how long could it take? Are there historical examples we can point to, I.e. late 90s/2008. 

3. There was a rumor that a NY pension fund is affiliated with Melvin. Is this true? If so, what the hell would happen if an entire hedge fund gambles a pension fund away? Hoping they're smart enough to diversify their clients assets. Any historical examples we can point to?

4. I heard a rumor (yes, yet another rumor) that multiple hedge funds went under/sustained huge losses. Does anyone have specific insight into this?

5. Do we know generally or specifically what securities/assets that Melvin and other related hedge funds have/are invested in? I know we don't have much transparency in terms of investments in the US, but may be there's a well hidden publicly facing investor report that their clients receive. 

6. If we don't know the assets they're invested in, how did we manage to find out that they were behind the GME short? 

7. Do we know of a country with disclosure laws that require individuals/hedge funds to disclose their positions?",2021-02-06 20:40:27

Its going to continue to drop so wait for that shit to go down to the dollar. We don't know if there's gonna be another squeeze by how the hedgies and RH screwed us over the first time. Them having all the bananas probably have found other ways to screw us over by now. Even Mark's AMA had a lot of ""next time you'll come back smarter"" phrasing as in the shit that happened here was phenomenal but most likely will have failed.

If it does fail, at least some people were early to buy nuggies. But people buying now is your own risk and not a meme. If it does fail, people well sell with well cash made. When that happens all the late apes will be left to dry for ""long term investing"" to hide the fact they literally lost thousands. And while losing thousands is great for meme purposes on this sub, all the newcomers are gonna be staring at the charts 24/7 never coming off the toilet.

If all you people who lost a ton of money do get gains somehow (because remember, people already HAVE gains, they just lost some because of the hedgies and want it back or some already cashed out with multi tendies) then consider yourselves lucky because these stocks are dropping and will continue to drop for a while and not everyone will have diamond hands.

Its hard to keep a meme going for so long. The memes are the only thing really pushing this. Once the meme dies, so does the volume. All the inexperienced traders don't know all the other smooth brained people are used to losing will continue to trade like normal, and they'll have nothing left but to stare at their loss cause of a meme and their poor timing to jump on a a bandwagon all late.

On a lighter note. If you already own GME or AMC don't sell yet, there's a good chance we'll at least get a small squeeze. Just don't be an actual retard and lose your life savings over this and keep buying when it hasn't finished dropping. And if you do buy.. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Not for the sake of the stock but for your own sake..

My experience is in commodities so I am actively looking for someone to correct me if I am wrong. I honestly have never worked with something that can be short squeezed, so listen to the comments not my post.

I’ve read the theories of the hedge funds using options to reduce their shorts, if I understand correctly and over simplified:

Hedge funds Sell Call options to a Market Maker, this gives the Market maker the right to hedge their length by selling Synthetic length, there the Hedge funds buy the length and voila shorts are closed, SI reduces. (Previously we were the recipients of these fake stocks, which is how shorts got over 100%)

However the hedge funds are left short options, which basically started this whole thing. What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios. 

They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM):
This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.

They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM):
This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn’t change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.

They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM):
This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.

They bought Puts at any strike:
This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.

TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent. This is honestly the reason I am holding ~75 stock at ~200 entry. And as I said at the start, I feel I am myself wrong so why would you listen to me to make financial decisions. Read the smartest looking comment below and make your own decisions.
