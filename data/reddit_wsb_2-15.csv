The trend is your friend!!  but don't be a sheep and don't fomo.

One or 3 sentences won't teach you how to trade.  Every trade is different.  Nothing but experience can really teach you.

The thing I do like seeing here is how many people actually want to invest for the long term.  Maybe the only sentence that truly works is the one about time in the market.  But dont confuse that with ""trading"".

$GOGO,9,ljxwx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljxwx3/gogo/,28,1613367160.0,"$GOGO basically a WIFI provider for Business Aviation.

They have high debt and a high short interest. **(44%)**

**Potential Catalysts :**

\-A debt refinance is coming and this should shave **200MM of interest expense** off the balance sheet. This need to be done by May.

**-Earnings coming in Mar** (no set date has been announced) - they could be cash flow positive for 2021. Most analyst believe they will be cash flow negative for 2021. Remember they have some cash from their sale of CA (Commercial Aviation)

\-**5G network** update from management?

\-**Bond prices** on $GOGO has been trading higher - indicating higher stock price coming. History have proven bond prices move before stock price on $GOGO.

\-**Moody credit rating** upgrade? **Analyst price target** upgrade?

I know the stock has ran from $10-15 since the announcement of the sale of CA from Sept, however the market cap on **$GOGO is only 1.3B at $15.50 stock price.**

In Millions - a high growth company with high profitability after selling CA division. a **10x multiple on revenue** puts the market cap at 3Billion. You can do the math.

All those are potential catalyst coming in the next few weeks to squeeze the stock. Please do you own DD. But I basically did most of it for you.

Those are the fundamentals. If you look at short interest. low float, CEO controls a lot of shares.  
We can see a gamma squeeze like GME if we bring in the reddit Autists. WE CAN DO THIS!!!!

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Reliable Mediocrity newsletter for the trading week ending on February 19th? We hope that this email finds you well and not completely dead from last week's weed stock boom. For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, don't go in on a stock when it is already massively outside its moving averages. While we are on that note: I would not (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE) pulling out gains from C C the Fourth, MARA, and RIOT to balance your earnings. While all three may continue to rise, always know how much of your unrealized gains that you are willing to lose.¬† I note this because last week was an absolute smoke show. If you believe in the long-term adoption of Voldemort, keep your RIOT and MARA because they will likely dominate the next couple years. From last week, if you followed along and pulled your plays, you definitely cashed in big time.¬†

* RIOT +76%
* MARA¬†+44%¬†
* C C the Fourth¬†+15%¬†
* CVS¬†+4.31%

This week, we are going to be looking into some of our earnings plays that could give us a solid pop leading into announcements. Personally, I believe the meme stocks are dead and that earnings are going to be our plays for the next few weeks until there is notable news coming out of new sectors. If you don't want to get off the meme stock bandwagon, be prepared for some massive roadblocks. Large institutions are riding the waves of meme stocks to cash in. Do you really think that retail investors have the money to move TLRY from $28 - $64 in one week? Of course they don't! Big money hops in with major cash looking to get a quick buck. They buy at $32, it pumps, and then they dump it all for a fast guaranteed profit. Are marijuana stocks going to rise through the Biden presidency? YES! But there won't be any movement that fast (time) and significant (% change) in an organic way.¬†

* ACB Long Hold 1/21/2022 ($25 Strike)  

   * I believe in weed stocks for real. I do NOT believe that last week was anything to realistically expect in the future. If you want to make big bucks in weed, you need to pay for the Theta! There is no guarantee on when federal legalization will occur, but we all know it's coming with so many states already legalizing recreational marijuana. I chose ACB because they're a stable business who has an extremely volatile stock. If they can return to their 2018 highs, we are going to cash in massively.¬†
   * NOTE: The TLRY¬†+ APHA merger is tempting, but buying APHA in hopes of cashing in on the arbitrage (83-86% of TLRY depending on who you believe). The risk for APHA is obviously that the TLRY price drops near merger and absolutely screws your play. That being said, APHA is currently trading at 58.49% of TLRY so the numbers are on your side if the merger happens in the near future. I have a feeling the merger won't happen until 4/20 at the earliest. You think I'm joking, but imagine the news that would create; ""Weed stonks merge on the most sacred of all days!""
* ARKF (Yes, specifically Fintech)  

   * RIOT and MARA have been crushing lately, but they're just one component of the financial technology¬†future. The real financial future will be diversified between ""normal"" fiat currency technology becoming more simplified through cloud based payment systems and digital wallets in general. The digital wallet market has just opened up and this can be seen through the success of Square, Apple Pay, Shopify, etc. When the general population as a whole transitions to these, which will happen, the fintech market will absolutely explode. Is ARKF a one week play, absolutely not, but it's almost guaranteed to continue its meteoric rise.¬†
   * My play is HEAVY in shares. The premiums for 1/21/2022 options are about¬†+$10/share ATM and¬†+$5/share OTM at¬†+43% of current trading price. Depending on what your goal here is, I'm going to say that shares are probably both safe AND a good investment for the future.¬†
   * Worth noting: ARKF is up 44% in the last 3-months. If you're willing to gamble on that to continue, those 1/21/2022 $85 strikes are gold.¬†
* CCL 3/12 ($24.5 Strike)  

   * Carnival Cruise Lines is boring as hell, there is no denying this. It's time that we finally admit that we all want to be in on the return of cruise lines. Where are they going? Up. When is the question. I'm going a month out and here is why. Dr. Genius Fauci says it will be ""open season"" for vaccinations of the general public by April. The reason I'm looking at 3/12 is because people are going to start hopping on the stock given the future expectations. If Fauci's promise is delivered in April, it will be open season for cruises again this summer. Can we make another play leading into June/August, for sure, but the cost of Theta right now looks a bit steep.¬†
   * Next, why $24.50? I'm shooting here because CCL hit $23.50 for absolutely no reason in early December and only pulled back to around¬†$20. We were heading into all time highs for cases in the US and we all knew it was only going to go up through the holidays. Next, if you've been watching the news, you have seen the MASSIVE decline in new cases occurring throughout the US. This is a massively huge moment for all travel and leisure related companies. But most of all, massive for cruise lines. This makes it VERY likely that CCL will ""cruise"" its way back up to $23-$24. If you want to be safe, hit that $23.5 mark.¬†
   * As always, don't exercise your options. Also, if you're up 50%+ just cash out and move on to the next play. Know your numbers and risk accordingly.¬†
* ZNGA (Just hear me out!) 1/21/2022 $20 Strike  

   * ZNGA has been recommended as a ""Best Buy"" through MF on multiple occasions. The hype of that alone is enough to keep it rolling for months to come. The MF followers buy and hold for long periods of time.¬† ZNGA is a massively successful mobile gaming company that is up 76.82% on the year. They recently announced they would be moving into multi-platform gaming to diversify their gaming experiences. ZNGA makes most of their money from micro-transactions that are small and frequent. They have shown that they are going to control the majority of the mobile gaming market.¬†
   * For the record, this might hit, it might not hit, but the cost is only $0.40 at current position. I'm looking to play a bunch of these and pull out around +75-100%, just keeping a few in hopes of a big OTM - ITM play.¬†
* Notable Mentions (More dangerous given their recent success)  

   * C C the Fourth - This guy is still a total toss up. I'm pulling some of my shares because if the acquisition doesn't happen, I'm not willing to risk it all. That being said, I'm going to hold 20-ish on the off chance of a meteoric rise post-acquisition.¬†
   * RIOT & MARA - I truly believe in the technology here and I will continue to hold unless there is¬†some sort of massive ban on their technology. Also, multiple large institutions have stated their interest in acquiring large sums of Voldemort for free cash holdings, similar to Tesla's action last week. If this occurs, RIOT and MARA will continue to explode.¬†

Sincerely,¬†

Lehman Brothers' Risk Management Department¬†

Intro to LEAPS,796,lkdlmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkdlmq/intro_to_leaps/,299,1613424247.0,"Thought I'd write up a quick intro to LEAPS (Long term Equity AnticiPation Security) for all you degenerates that have recently joined whilst the markets are closed today for the break. I've been seeing a lot of loss porn lately (generally from shares thanks to a certain gaming company, but also with people losing on FDs), and I feel compelled to at least put this out there to whoever's willing to listen.

Obligatory, this is not financial advice and has been written for informative/education purposes. 

&#x200B;

**1) What are LEAPS** 

LEAPS are basically standard Call or Put options with long term expiries, by the books anything beyond 3+ months may be considered LEAPS but for me I'll usualy look into 9+ months deep in the money options when looking at LEAPS. 

&#x200B;

**2) How can I make some tendies with LEAPS?** 

The key benefits to options (let's take long call options as the example) is that they magnify your potential gains through the magic of leverage. 

But with these benefits comes some complexities when buying and selling options such as Black Scholes options pricing, the Greeks and the risks that come with the leverage. Given the recent fat gains from some users here you may feel compelled to jump in and do the same yourself either by yoloing into a share or even worse, yoloing into weekly options. The latter being the reason why WSB being as infamous as it is. 

The issue with the two methods above, for the ones who like making money, is that 1) Buying shares is expensive and may not give you the fat upside you are chasing or 2) FDs give you that potential upside, but 99% of the time you lose everything you put in as you options dies from theta decay (time value of an option).

I believe LEAPS gives a great middle groud for you bulls out there, it gives you near 1:1 exposure to the underlying asset, minimised outlay and a longer time horizon for both capital gains tax benefits and protection against short term volatility (where you usually get screwed on FDs). 

&#x200B;

Take AMD as an example, solid stock with good financial and future prospects. We like the stonk. 

Consider a scenario where you have $10,000 to invest or gamble..(depends who  you talk to), I want to walk you through each scenario and possible outcomes of the trade.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 1: Buy FD - $106 Call Feb26 '21 expiry @$40 per contract x 250 contracts (ALL IN)**

Options have two things that make up there value, instrinsic and extrinsic value. Since at the time of writing the market price is $93.5, this option is well out of the money and has zero intrinsic value. All you're paying for is the extrinsic value of option which is the time value and implied volatility (IV) of the option, defined as Theta and Vega in the greeks. 

If the price doesn't hit your $106 strike by expiry, you lose your premium of $40 ($0.4 x 100 shares). In the outside chance that it does pump to at or above your strike, depending on how fast it rises, your option will build more extrinsic value (thanks to Vega), but also the intrinsic value will rise as you are in the money. 

To simplify the outcomes let's say you hold to expiry because you ain't no paper handed bitch, one of two things can happen:

*a) Expire OTM or ATM: Goodbye $10,000. That's it..you gambled and you lost it. GG*

*b) Sell ITM:* Welcome to tendy town, let's just you sell ITM the day of expiry when the market price if $108 (+$2 on your strike), since you bought 250 contract your total gain is 250 x 100 shares x $2 profit = $50,000 profit. As you can see, even with this example of a modest +$2 ITM you can make 5x you initial investment. But the liklihood is so very low, hence the cheap buy in.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 2: Buy LEAPS- $50 Call Jun17 '22 expiry @$4800 per contract x 2 contracts** 

Since the LEAPS are more expensive, you can only afford 2x contracts, which equates to 200 shares of expsosure (instead of 25,000). 

So under the same scenario 1 where the price moves to $108 in a week, your gain will be \~$12 per share since you actually bought so deep in the money, instead of the OTM where delta is tiny). So if you sold your option here you would make a tidy 200x$13 = $2600 from the same price movement.

If the price movement was down, where your FD expires OTM, the LEAP will be fine as you have plenty of time to recovery from the movement. 

Fast forward towards expiry, if AMD moves up, so does your option value at the rate of Delta, if it moves down then the maximum risk is the premium you paid at $9600. (where the share price drops to your strike or below).

In the worst case, if AMD tanks and goes to $20, you could opt to buy in at that price @ 200 shares x $20 =$4000, leaving your total cost base at $13,600. So even if you convert to a long term play tou can come out with a lower overall cost base for the same exposure.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 3: Buy Shares - 200 shares @ $93.5**

This isn't an exact comparison between scenario 1 and 2, as the initial investment is $18,700 vs the \~$10k of the options. But it exhibits the point that between the extremes of FD's and LEAPS in the call option world, the initial equity required to open a position that is on par with the LEAPS (and nowhere near the FD's) is enormous. 

In this scenario, the payout outcome is pretty much inline with buying leaps, with the leaps paying out slightly less since in the option price you are paying for a small amount of extrinsic value to have the ""option"" given by the option contract. 

&#x200B;

In summary:

FD's are basically gambles on very short term volatility, please understand this. The loss porn is great, but I don't want to see people lose their livelihoods. 

LEAPS are a great combo for both long term and short term plays, with lower cost based vs shares for the same exposure.

&#x200B;

**First, let's look at immediate and previous trends.**

https://preview.redd.it/ym5o0ajshhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9c1d908400240c3eba84d6c21333c203a2bbdf1

What do you see? That's right, monkee, stock go down and then stock go up. Very good.

&#x200B;

**But why? Why stock go down go up?**

https://preview.redd.it/brwav6k1ihh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de641e5a7c7fa21ae558a5f2a347217614926e64

Yes monkee you see right. Price break below support, break below trend, enter time of sad! But then other monkee buy! Say cheap! Stock price wedge! And lots monkee buy! So price break through wedge and resistance!

You see, monkee, wedge is strong, big pressure. If stock go up though wedge mean BIG UP! If stock go down through wedge mean BIG SAD! Like hole in coconut, stock pour!

But here, stock break free! Like hole in clouds. Stock go BIG UP!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5q4s9adjhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11ddf4912effb68d1db41af08442c9a9bb4ec3be

Wedge easy see.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4m4n280hjhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=669d72d4af09fa42879f2bee98a167a3cf2d7b9a

Wedge again? Yes, BIG UPS!

Awooga? Wedge again? YES, MONKEE! Monkee see. BIG UPS! Stock price break free of wedge and downwards trend! Stock is only go up!

&#x200B;

**BUT ACTUALLY STOCK GO DOWN FIRST**

No be sad, monkee. All come up come down. Many monkee say ""Stock too much up, too much banana.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i77cmbp2khh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a2b33c3edc6f605d724d0e8d4b06847df3e4842

This MACD chart. MACD show what other monkee think other monkee do.

When line cross, like snake cross river, stock go up or down. If river cross snake, big down. If snake cross river, big up! Now, river cross snake, so probably big down coming. **BUT NOT ALWAYS TRUE!**

That is why, monkee, monkee see many charts. Monkee see many indicators! Monkee smart, monkee guess and check!

**Monkee look at Bolinger Bands next!**

https://preview.redd.it/ho2ozvyjkhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45c9e04887e3083354c66e8b9b562191d2ff0b76

This call Bolinger. Bolinger maker man say ""When price is big in bolinger, price is overprice."" and ""When price is low in Bolinger, price is underprice."" Monkee see, in Bolinger, price is overprice. 

Bolinger also show if price is making ups too fast and downs too fast. When bolinger big, price ups and downs too fast! So you see, price making too big ups too big downs.

Not only this. Also Bolinger maker man say ""When Bolinger is get more skinny, trend become backwards."" So you see monkee, up trend be down trend soon!

But still! Monkee careful. No want lose banana! So monkee do more DD, be good monkee. Because last week, monkee lose all money on $GME and $SNDL. Bad monkee! Monkee no listen to reddit!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fdr4xr0mhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=677be91c0f44beece9c4a75d0551c608e4f31ec2

Monkee check RSI! RSI very good. When RSI in middle, stonk OK! When RSI is high, TOO MUCH MONKEE BUY! If stonk above purple, STONK IN DANGER, SELL NOW!

Not only this, but if RSI and STONK no match, mean trend go backwards! Name of this is called ""Divergence"". But little monkey head don't worry big words.

What monkee see is difference in graph. Stonk say I go up! RSI say I go down. Stock BIG UP when few monkee buy?! Not good. When this happen, listen to RSI. Bubble pop soon!

Some stupid man say ""NO! RSI NO MEAN TOO MUCH BUY OR SELL!"" But monkee, this how other monkee use RSI. And RSI very popular. So many other monkee now think same. So many monkee is want sell.

*IF MONKEE WANT TO LOOK BY SELF, MONKEE SEE THAT RSI PREDICT $GME AND $SNDL BIG DOWN! MONKEE NO LOSE ALL BANANA IF LOOK AT RSI! Monkee sad, monkee learn, monkee make banana.*

&#x200B;

**So what monkee talk to you think? Go up? Go down?**

https://preview.redd.it/enx89a2wnhh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de5816d5b7c721e230e49b7965858bd9511a4ece

You see monkee, $F boring STONK! That why good for learn, good for trade. $F make boring car, not cool car like big dongerino friend $TSLA and friend Musk.

$F is sleepy, like follow trend. You see last $F go too much big from up trend so $F big crash and then go up again. Or even go down after.

So monkee talk to you think say this happen again.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qypwuqgjohh61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0acc3a8cc0a3e2318258a1d29bee01549a699290

Stock go up again with up trend, but first stock come down. No be sad. Monkee buy puts. Then when big down sell puts buy calls! Many banana! Ho ho ho!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: AWOOOGA!**

* Too big up in trend
* Too many monkee buy
* Now cost up too much
* River cross snake!

Fed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react



S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio

In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller‚Äôs book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today‚Äôs Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. 

Dot com bubble: 44
Today: 35 


Warren Buffett‚Äôs favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices.

The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. ""If the ratio approaches 200%‚Äîas it did in 1999 and a part of 2000‚Äîyou are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.

Current Buffet Indicator: 195%
Dot com bubble Indicator: 159%


Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion‚Äînearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It‚Äôs currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious


Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors


Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania.


S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. 

Today, the top five‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook‚Äîmake up 21% of the index‚Äôs total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top. 

Is this it? The end is near?

This is a company that I think would be a long term move - market cap of $20b - total revenue at over $2b - and some smart money makin moves in   the meantime, but I don't know SHIT

Definitely not a get rich quick type of ticker, but looks good for that smooth brain ride you all care about.

Generac  is the leading manufacturer in power backup and generation systems. They produce home and commercial backup equipment up to 2mw, as well as have lines of power-washers, snowblowers, and other motored chore equipment. They are the number one provider of their products in North America. Recently they have budded into clean energy with the Generac PWRcell, a competitor to the Tesla (simmer down) Powerwall with the option to choose different sizes at different price ranges (something Papa Elon's baby lacks). In November they announced they were taking over the Harley Davidson Roadhouse to create the Generac Power Stage at the Milwaukee World Festival , a popular venue for concerts and other performances (it's a new source of revenue but ik who the fuck cares).   Recently Generac also announced that they are opening a new production facility in South Carolina providing 450 jobs. This is to deal with the increase in demand and for larger production capabilities in the future. As more people work from home and extreme weather related power outages become increasingly frequent these backup systems are becoming critical to many households across the world.

(here boy üöÄ)

On   top of all this the management is a bunch of Milwaukee bulls. Our boy Aaron Judgefield sits at CEO/President has worked at Generac for a whopping 26 years from an accountant all the to his current position as head hog. This All-American slab of ground beef will fuck your wife before you knew he threw you out of bed, and I trust he has a stake in the well-being of the company given his long history. Most of the top management has spent years at this company, and they've only made money   moves so you're choice.

In Q3 2020  Generac saw a 17% increase in sales, and beat expected EPS for the  5th  quarter in a row. This brought a 2020 net sales of $2.48 billion,  which  is up two billion from last year. GNRC did this while doubling  their  cash in hand from $322 to $655 million. Debt has only increased  slightly  for the amount of bills they're taking in. By 2026 the home  generator  market alone is estimated to be worth $7.6 with GNRC looking  to be the  top dawg among suppliers.

Current  ticker is at $326 (2/13), but price targets have been adjusted from under $250 to $360 by a few different firms (Goldman, JPMorgan, Roth, Oppenheimer). Average target $346 with the high hovering at $400. We don't talk about the low.

Dove soap, Lipton Tea, Ben & Jerry's, Vaseline, Klondike and every goddamn tea or shampoo you've ever used is straight from UL. UL, like a lot of consumer discretionary stocks, has been declining since consumer spending and buying power have increased due to all the stimulus checks Americans have been getting .... oh wait. This represents an opportunity to take long positions on UL since consumer spending is expected to return to normal levels once those stimmy checks drop and UL's huge catalogue of food, personal care, and household care products will absorb those sales. 


Main Points:  

1. The first wave of Biden's 1.9 Trillion Stimulus, $1400 checks will sent via direct deposit during the week of March 8, paper checks will be sent on the week of March 22. People are going to spend these on staples like food, toiletries, and household items.

2. UL from the technicals is currently [oversold](https://imgur.com/a/y2Ui62v). Shit crop I know, but I'm too lazy to redo it. Support has been established at 53.9 and has been holding the last week. The RSI on the daily chart reached 26 a few days go, and is currently in the low 30s. 

Options are quite cheap on UL rn. I would have got more but I loaded up on LI at around 30ish last week. 

TLDR: Consumer spending low rn. 1400 dolla stimmy checks is basically giving free money to food, personal care, and home care companies like UL.

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

**Point 2:** OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1.1x sales. The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair (W).

[Fig 2 - OSTK and W relative comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/n0vk6gc5lih61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28eca64e8d10be029dce04ef5fee1581a9c9225)

**Point 3:** Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing. 1 month ago, institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40% through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley, Allianz SE, Blackrock, and Vanguard as well. In fact, Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year. [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf)

Last week, Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7.5%.

**Point 4:** OSTK has short interest of over 10%. With 42.77 million shares outstanding, and a 40 million share float, latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4.374 million shares are currently held short. While that may seem relatively small, naked short selling is still occurring with 16 SEC fail-to-delivers during January occurring on OSTK.

Legendary short trader Marc Cohodes is long on this name and I learned about this stock from his posts on Twitter.

**Point 5:** OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker-dealer issues (\*cough\* Robinhood \*cough\*) and transparency at the right time. Briefly, tZero is an alternative trading system **regulated** by the SEC that will enable people to invest in **any** asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times. Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto, tokenized securities, and stocks.

Current assets include OSTKO, tZEROp, ASPD. With the acquisition of Bitt: B/T/C, E/T/H, L/T/C, and RVN are now tradeable. The current roadmap is to have traditional securities such as stocks traded on the platform by Q4 2021.

[Fig 5 - tZERO trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/b4jyb74elih61.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9af5bbe4794c9067dd22fb60792bf942598d8d9)

[Fig 6 - tZERO $ nominal trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/swgb2o1hlih61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f12882ff8c6c34e6d12df252871cc6f0a6f94a)

**Point 5:** OSTK holds a 90% stake in tZERO. tZERO is nascent. With only $53 million traded in digital token securities, this is small to other markets and exchanges. However, this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020.

Numbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear. The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year-to-year traded.

Coinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion. In 2020, it had a revenue of $2.3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion. Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks.

Napkin math: simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities ($53 million in digital tokens + $13 million in c$rypto = $67 million), this implies tZero has a valuation of $2.5 billion when compared to Coinbase. Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear, OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value.

[Fig 7 - Coinbase revenue](https://preview.redd.it/vxnyrjzllih61.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3d11ee7aa6852ff0f4826b829376028a61b6fa)

DYOR. Know your risk. Size appropriately. Manage your own trade.

Important areas to watch next 130, 172, 256, 394, 482, 512.

**tl;dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK's true value.**

On a simple relative valuation, OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios. Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK, tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same valuation of OSTK. This does not include future performance, multiples, or other blockchain businesses such as Voatz that OSTK has a stake in.

Q4 earnings 2/24/21.

Potential headwinds: Execution by management of their timeline for tZERO's rollout. Failure to get FINRA approval for stocks. G20 simultaneous regulation of c$ryptocurrencies. Slowing down of the economy and appetite for risk assets such as c$ryptocurrenices in 2H 2021.

This isn't a squeeze - it's a bank run.",1739,ljsu1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljsu1c/there_is_officially_a_silver_shortage_and_silver/,1103,1613352529.0,"The U.S. Mint just admitted [they can't print enough](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-precious-coins-demand/us-mint-unable-to-meet-demand-for-gold-silver-bullion-coins-idUSL1N2K82XU) silver and gold coins to meet demand. CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.

You don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.

I'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:

&#x200B;

But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.

How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.

How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.

Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.

DON'T BUY $SLV

EDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market. Could be. Don't know. Good luck out there. ",2021-02-15 03:28:49

Maybe this is the new norm where we're constantly above the GDP and life is booming. Or perhaps this is from Uncle Sam printing as much money as it pleases. Just remember, at some point it has to come down and when it does you can make a lot of money if you know where to put it.

People in 2000 had the exact same mentality and I'm a student of history who believes that history always repeats itself. Good luck and stay safe.

P.S. Keep an eye on the US inflation rate, VIX, and US treasury bonds. I know we're smart but the people on Wall Street have played this game longer than us and we at least have to have the mental capacity to admit that.

Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon,1983,ljp713,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljp713/why_i_think_amd_is_going_up_a_lot_soon/,730,1613341163.0,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

I'm coming up on 8 years of being apart of this sub this year. It's been a pretty *interesting* couple of years for me to say the least. :P

I remember when j/artek first introduced me to this subreddit, back in late 2013 I thnk it was. It was really a whole new experience for me. And then to actually be invited as part of the mod team here a year or so later, which I'm embarrassed to admit I had declined for personal reasons. Regretting that decision bigly, even to this day believe it or not. * facepalm *

But anyway, I thought it was quite fitting for V-day to fall on this day here today. Because, I do genuinely feel like this entire subreddit community is my valentine. I know these past couple of weeks have a bit a hard on this community. And I feel you guys!

I know there are quite a ton of you out there who would like to see the sub righted back to the good 'ole days of WSB, which I largely remember the most of this subreddit community honestly. Been trying hard to get some of my own content posting in here regularly again, like the most anticipated weekly earnings whispers threads (speaking of which -- I have quite a bit of interesting stats to share with you all [on that thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj0slc/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)!), or my [weekly wall street week ahead thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj2irq/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/) which i know a lot of you really enjoy reading on the weekends, albeit tedious af to put together since i literally setup those threads all manually by hand lol. And now, most recently getting [my daily pre-market thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liazjl/212_fridays_premarket_stock_movers_news/) back going on a more consistent basis here once again.

I know I'm only one dude here, but am trying all that I can to right the ship back to the old times WSB that I remembered. It's admittedly been a bit tough but I feel like maybe we're slowly making some good progress with that. :D

But anyway, I really did just want to give y'all's a big time shout out and thank you, for all of your support throughout my years on this subreddit. Seriously cannot say that enough man.

Anymore, more on that weekly earnings thread of mine in here from yesterday. That thread believe it or not happened to break all sorts of records for me  here on Reddit. Not even shittin' you guys. I've been a Redditor for coming up on 8 years this year, and...

Here are the records I set on my thread here from yesterday:

*****

> *  **1.) Most hours spent holding the #1 top voted thread on r/wallstreetbets. (which mind you I think was the very first time I had ever had any thread as *the* top voted at any point during my time here).**

> * **2.) My most upvoted thread EVER anywhere on Reddit over my near 8 years on this site.**

> * **3.) Most Reddit awards (or ""guilds"" as it's called i guess in Reddit?) ever given to me in a single Reddit thread.**

> * **4.) and finally the most post I ever had people reply in a single Reddit thread.**

*****

https://i.imgur.com/P6pJwtp.png

It was really quire remarkable for me to see if I'm being wholeheartedly honest here. Being apart of this subreddit community since near this sub's inception for me personally has been a real honor. Some people call me crazy for having a special thing in my heart for this sub. But, those few people sadly don't know much about this community's history. Some just like to hear only the negatives and don't think there isn't anything positive to say about this community. Which I think is so totally wrong.

This sub has a lot to offer. And always has. Yes, I get the past few weeks or so has been a bit hard, but that's not always how things were around here.

Anyway, now I'm just rambling along here lol. Didn't intend to make this into a huge wall of text as it has become. :P

But, I did just want to take this opportunity to thank of all of you here at the community for all the awesome memories for one, and for all of your  praise and support here, I mean I can't even count how many awards were given out to me on that weekly earnings thread from yesterday. It was a pretty mind blowing tbh. Truly am very grateful for this community, and for all of you have stuck around here throughout the years here! You guys truly are the best IMHO. :)

Here's to another 8 years ahead here at WSB! Keep up the awesome work here everyone!

Happy Valentine's Day.

Cannabis Stocks are Going BONGkers Ultimate DD,499,lkdu3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkdu3w/cannabis_stocks_are_going_bongkers_ultimate_dd/,541,1613425113.0,"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN CANNABIS (Shorting and hype aren't reasons)

In recent weeks, multiple factors have made pot stocks all the buzz. To begin with, Democrats taking control of Congress and the Oval Office could bring about real federal cannabis reforms. During the previous administration, Republican Mitch McConnell repeatedly kept cannabis legislation from reaching the Senate floor as Senate Majority Leader. Now, as Senate Minority Leader, McConnell no longer holds the same power. New Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been clear that he intends to co-draft legislation to legalize marijuana in the U.S. üá∫üá∏

Gallup's national sentiment poll on cannabis showed that an¬†all time record of 68% of people in 2020 favored the idea of legalization. More specifically, 83% of self-identified Democrats want to wave the green flag on marijuana

I wouldn't focus on Aurora, Tilray-Aphira, Canopy, and definitely NOT Sundial. These stocks WILL NOT make you rich.

My Ultimate 2 Picks in the Industry:

VILLAGE FARMS: ¬†In November, Village Farms took full control of cannabis grower Pure Sunfarms, which it had established¬†as joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics. Village Farms announced that it had fully repaid that debt, with accrued interest, putting the transaction to rest well ahead of schedule. ¬†

In addition, Village Farms announced that it had increased its investment in Altum International, an Asian cannabinoid company, from around 6.6% to roughly 10%. This move will expand Village Farms' reach internationally, and it has the right to increase its stake in Altum further in the future. Helping to fund both of these deals was a $135 million equity sale it conducted in late January. 

Village Farms is positioned as a high-tech, low-cost, vertically integrated company focused on agricultural consumers and is actively seeking high-growth opportunities in emerging legal cannabis and related markets in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

The company‚Äôs Texas site is ready for hemp production when it receives a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Canada, it aims to increase the number of stores in Ontario from 300 to 1,000 next year. The company also has a presence in Europe ‚Äî last year it became one of six equal shareholders in a Netherlands-based cannabis company.



GREEN THUMB:

If you¬†want to own Cannabis winners, Sundial Growers should be just about the last name you should buy. Instead, focus on successful U.S. multistate operators that are on the cusp of recurring profitability.

It currently has 52 operating dispensaries in legalized states, with the ability to open as many as 96 retail locations in a dozen states.¬† What stands out is the company's focus on states like Illinois, Nevada, and New Jersey -- the latter of which legalized recreational pot in the November election. Illinois, for instance, is a limited license state (i.e., only a set number of retail locations will be allowed). With the Land of Lincoln reaching $1 billion in weed sales in its first year following the legalization of adult-use pot, Green Thumb stands a good chance of securing significant share in this budding market.

Another reason Green Thumb is so successful is its inorganic growth. In June 2019, Green Thumb closed on its acquisition of Integral Associates, giving the company access to more than a half-dozen retail locations in Nevada, including the sole location on the Las Vegas Strip.¬†

Lastly, Green Thumb¬†generates 70% of its revenue from derivatives¬†(e.g., edibles, beverages, vapes, topicals, and concentrates). Derivatives offer substantially higher margins than dried cannabis flower, which is a big reason Green Thumb is turning the corner to profitability before many of its peers.

FUTU holdings is going to continue PRINTING faster than JPowell or mommy Yellen. Mark my words,68,lkdega,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkdega/futu_holdings_is_going_to_continue_printing/,81,1613423521.0,"Wazup you wackjob fucks. I mean autists.

FUTU holdings is the ""Robin hood"" of China blah blah blah.. whatever.

Listen here. Robin hoods, IG holdings, Webull, all these dudes actually have crazy net profit margins (averaging 40% NET PROFIT MARGIN). I worked in a CFD broker for a while and I saw how they do it...

This is their magic 'SAUCE' - they offer you leverage. Then you Mr Autistic fuck head who just saw a post on WSB goes ahead and uses LEVERAGE to buy $1,000 worth of the stock with your measly 100$ equity account.

You only have 100$ in your account but you can leverage that shit *easily* with 1:10 leverage.

**Guess what-** you also pay 10 Times the fucking spread on the stock, or commission. THERE IS ALWAYS A PRICE.

Okay, if you've read this far I can explain to you how this relates to FUTU holdings.

&#x200B;

40% net profit margin is the NORM in this industry, and they have just broken through to economies of scale

FUTU holdings has a LOW P/E of 180. That's low because they literally DOUBLED their net profit last quarter. What happens to a company with a P/E of 180 when net income doubles autists? P/E goes to 90 - *in one quarter.*

They have 10 million active users on their platform, China's population around 1.4Bn. They have ATLEAST a 100 million market in terms of people who will sign up and lose all their money on their app.

Their user growth and their paid user growth hasn't been slowing, it's been accelerating.

Like you have to be fucking retarded not to buy this fucking stock.

Biggest risk - China will probably regulate this business when they realise how damaging 'gambling on the stock market' actually is. Till then, it's a rocket to fucking 100 or 200BN USD

&#x200B;

I don't think many understood this aspect:

&#x200B;

**P/E 180**, is obviously super high, *but*\*\*\*,\*\*\* this company is seeing increases in net profit of over 100% in ONE QUARTER. That means over 1 full year P/E ratio could easily fall drastically.

&#x200B;

For a company seeing growth as high as this, a PE of 180 is super misleading and makes chodes and normies alike say 'overvalued'. If the price doesn't move from here, and growth keeps going at the same pace (there shouldn't be anything stopping it, only regulation). Then next year price to earnings could be around 20-30 (STILL with significant growth prospects).

Okay folks, weebs, simps and autists.

Some of the comments said to take a look at TIGR. I've modelled their statements. They are *just about* to hit the 40% economies of scale net profit margin. Their 2020 Year looked like FUTU's 2019 year in terms of margins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, I am currently doing some more due diligence into this company...Mainly, we need to find out if the company allows people to easily deposit from Chinese Mainlanders.

FUTU, as the comments have said, make it difficult for mainland customers to deposit money. They first need to open up a bank account in Hong Kong. Is TIGR's process any different? I will find out and update.

DD for Checkpoint (CHKP),29,lkaemj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkaemj/dd_for_checkpoint_chkp/,58,1613411214.0,"**Preamble**

Comming from a technology background I clearly have a better edge when looking into these types of companies opposed to other sectors.

Checkpoint is first a Security company with a productline of firewalls and other network related software/hardware configurations such as IDS, IPS, Gateways and more. Checkpoint also runs a highly skilled security research team that, just by looking at last year had the awesome finding of SigRed that could have been a very potent vulnerability.

Checkpoint is located in Israel but traded on Nasdaq.

**Disclaimer**

I bought 26 shares for an avarage price of 120,48 on friday.

**Financials**

Checkpoint is  running as a profitable business trading at P/E of 20,26 and EPS at 5,96.

Checkpoint has had YoY growth in revenue for the past 3 years (not looking further back), no large outstanding debt to be paid and a free cashflow that covers just about a years worth of expeses for financing activities.

They've beaten EPS the last 4 quarters whereas the latest came in at 2.17 with expected 2.11.

**Price range**

As the Q4 earnings came out there has been an increase in shorting of the stock which was reported at \~8% of float on the 29th reporting. This can also be observed in the price chart:

[CHKP 3 months candlestick chart](https://preview.redd.it/lwwk71nl0mh61.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce04630fee898d0b285afbee7ae16bad8fee5f18)

*Why short?*

I have absolutely no idea. It's a healthy company with good financials, a great prospect for future growth given their position in the market. While the network product line continues to dominate (at least from my industry perspective) their research team is of the highest standard and they've continued to grow their product line in other areas such as threat prevention and cloud security.

*Positives:*

* Good position in the market
* Good financials
* Good productline
* Good access to skilled resources (being in Israel and their heavy investment in Cyber Security)

*Negatives:*

* Highly competitive market
* Short positions seem to increase (theoretical SI could be at 11,48%)
* Short term estimate from CHKP is below what the market hoped
* Downward trend when looking at SMA30+SMA50 (see below)

Everyone knows ‚ÄúFord‚Äù there‚Äôs rumors a merger with Tesla but I don‚Äôt think it would ever happen the brand ‚ÄúFord‚Äù is like Disney to famous be acquired but it‚Äôs a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* A 500 billion dollar investment and partial ownership of Rivian, a member of the Ford family on Rivian's board of trustees, and a partnership with Rivian to be able to use Rivian's skateboard (R1T, R1S) platform.
* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.
* Owns SPIN, the scooter company.
* Massive ICE F-150 profits instead of Tesla shareholders and tax credits to fund their EV and autonomous plans.

Trivago Risks + Changing Strategy - VRBO and AirBnB,124,lk60o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk60o4/trivago_risks_changing_strategy_vrbo_and_airbnb/,53,1613393440.0,"All - I wanted to be transparent in my research with Trivago because there have been lots of comments and there is definitely risk.

For those that want to read the original DD post, it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljjcvj/trivago_dd/).

&#x200B;

Some Risks

&#x200B;

* Trivago has definitely had a hard go.
* Trivago has had recent leadership changes.
* Trivago lost a lot of business from bookings.com
* Airbnb definitely poses a threat to Trivago - although there seems to be some good info on partnerships.
* The industry is competitive.
* Trivago is a marketing company at it's core.
* Trivago revenue is way down and the recovery will take a while.

&#x200B;

One Item I wanted to highlight from this [bear](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/13/trivago-faces-a-challenging-2020.aspx) article is the following snippet about Trivago partnering with Airbnb- I think this is bullish, but I can't find airbnb listings on trivago yet. VRBO listings are plentiful, which makes sense due to Expedia having a huge position in Trivago.

It looks as if Trivago is being proactive on alternative listings and reacting to the changing business environment. See snippet BELOW.

"Comparing Market Volume Patterns for Stocks from WSB Sectors WeedGang, DiamondHands, and VintageTech: Predictions for Tuesday",195,lk5iy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk5iy5/comparing_market_volume_patterns_for_stocks_from/,60,1613391634.0,"This post presents several market volumes for multiple stocks with daily price changes in an attempt to explain a possible method to identify future dips in share price.

Since the last time, I automated a TON of the process I used in my [last post to predict dips with market volume patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/) to where now I can search across stocks WAY FASTER for market volumes starting to sync and rise up. **For those curious, READ the old DD post,** and linked to a public version there for those wanting to recreate the figures.

**NOTE:** *Jan 26th data is shit* for NASAQ BX, it shows some stocks having MORE short volume then there was total volume, and FINRA actually removed their 26th data and replaced it recently, so that date in the plots should be ignored.

**Understanding the Legend:**

* **F** is data from FINRA Daily Volume files
* **NP** is data from NASDAQ PSX market's daily volume files.
* **NB** is data from NASDAQ BX market's daily volume files.
* **ShXVo**l is the short exempt volume for the day from FINRA
* **ShVol** is the short volume for the day from the respective market
* **MaxShXVol** is the largest value short exempt daily volume from FINRA for all the data shown
* **MaxSVol** is the largest value from the short volume data from respective market
* **TotVol** is the day's total volume from the respective market
* **DayChange** is the ( day's closing price minus the opening price ) divided by the opening price
* **PreOpenActivity** is the (previous day's close - day's open)/ previous day's close

[Figure 0: Plots for TSLA markets, top and bottom show similar values that differ by normalization. ](https://preview.redd.it/z2rixi5hyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45ef261fcc2a2593fd10a4e9bd3fb51bf5519f3)

**Overview of the Method Using TSLA:**

* Identify which days TSLA fell the most:
   * Jan 11th, Jan 15th, Jan 29th, and Feb 10th TSLA fell 4-5%
* Look for patterns and trends in available data around those days:
   * NASDAQ BX(BLUE) and PSX(RED) short volumes go higher around those days
   * Jan 8th, Friday before Monday's Jan 11th dip, showed blue and red syncing up and climbing.
   * Jan 14th showed similar behaviour, but peaked much lower
   * Jan 27th and 28th had red and blue both rising steadily before Jan 29th dip
   * Feb9th, going into Feb 10th, has a HUGE sharp spike in both red and blue. This one seemed VERY sudden and probably could not be used.
* **Generalize Findings:**
   * Different market's short volumes sometime start to move in a similar way before significant dips in price.

**Summary:**

* ***By watching for similar behavior across different markets, a possible dip can sometimes be identified  the previous trading day, and possibly two days prior.***

&#x200B;

Hopefully the above explained to you the general method that I used in the previous post to predict the drop in the one stock. HOWEVER, I have not tried this with any other stocks, and I have not claimed that this will predict every dip. Rather, this only appears to predict significant dips in the price, where significant is relative to the dataset.

**So how does it work?**

* Usually the different markets appear to be independent of each other, some high, some low, trending up or down, doing their own thing... MOST of the time.
* From what I've seen, when the markets do appear to sync and act in a similar method, regarding their short volumes rising together, the share price dips.
* The volumes across the three different markets are VERY DIFFERENT, and unique for each stock. I've also only looked at data from NASDAQ based exchanges, even though some stocks are listed on the NYSE, some volume is still done via these markets.

&#x200B;

***My thoughts to explain all this:***

*When different markets all start to think the price is TOO HIGH, and start to short the stock, this general consensus across the markets becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the price dips.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So without further ado, here are the plots that were asked for by popular demand!

# 1.) Diamond Hands Sector: AMC and GME

https://preview.redd.it/742aciqkyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf7782b899b15ad9a9113accc4a404648e053ab6

General Comments: Volumes have calmed down SIGNIFICANTLY since the excitement in late January. Very similar patterns in GME and AMC, and appears that short volumes have decreased over the last two days:

**Prediction:** GME and AMC up a small amount Tuesday, but nothing exciting, maybe even neutral.

&#x200B;

# 2.) WEED GANG Sector: SNDL and TLRY

https://preview.redd.it/56yuvzhcyjh61.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=200b5f171f259c17ddaef98e1841ddf22067cdc1

Again we see very similar market volume behavior across two stocks. The recent trend in different short volumes and similar behavior regarding their slope, and large dips in price, could be compared to either Jan 6th, where it would fall Monday, or Feb 8th, where it would rise Monday.

**Prediction:** SNDL and TLRY struggle Tuesday, but ends up positive.

&#x200B;

# 3.) VINTAGE TECH Sector: NOK and BB

https://preview.redd.it/pw0az0h0zjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc53002f21f2250ebf3f63893cf5af6f42ebdb9

Yea, I couldn't think of a better name for these two, so ""Vintage"" it became. There volumes have also significantly cooled off since late January. Without some comparable swings in volumes can't really say anything, especially since the NOK has been flat for weeks even back in 2020.

**Prediction:** NOK and BB both just forget to set their morning alarms for Tuesday and sleep in.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Explained my method for how to look for upcoming dips.
* No signs of large, significant dips for Tuesday for any stocks shown above.
* Made half-assed predictions for Tuesday:
   * None of them dip significantly, weed sector **may** start recovery, and I buy discount Valentine's Day candy.

**EDIT: Premarket for Predictions (6:00am)**

* DiamondHands: GME +1.3%, AMC +16%!
* WeedGang: SNDL +8%, TLRY +3%
* VintageTech: NOK +2%, BB -1.6%

Transportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won‚Äôt make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . 

Looking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP

2 More traditional/‚Äù big players‚Äù financial stocks

I have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:

Fintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I‚Äôve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can‚Äôt be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of ""recover"" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.

There‚Äôs also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.

Looking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM

======

3 Military and Defense

The mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won‚Äôt just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).

Looking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)

======

4 Tech Infrastructures

With everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.

Looking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC

======

5 Virtual Currency

I am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don‚Äôt mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks.

Edit: I see a few people asking so here is a link to the hearing https://financialservices.house.gov/live/ it will start on Feb 18th at 1200 ET.

Why you should buy $COTY this week. Worth $10 to $30 depending on time horizon. Mentioned on Barrons as buy. Michael Burry may own calls too!,94,lk287t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk287t/why_you_should_buy_coty_this_week_worth_10_to_30/,328,1613380562.0,"I own $COTY stock and calls and I think you should too. Stock is a value play with many catalysts. Target $10 to $30 depending in time horizon.

Here is why I bought 500 contracts of $COTY Calls for Feb 19th $7 strike, almost 5% of Open interest. 

A bit of background first so you can understand the reasoning why I am pretty much all in on calls. Can post pic of my account below for proof. Please do your own due diligence. I have read all of the coty annual reports for the past few years, transcripts, interviews, 8k filings, i even walked to their headquarters in Amsterdam to see if it was open during the pandemic. So, when i make a bet I do a lot of research. 

I used to work at a hedge fund and one of the reasons why I quit was because I realized I was helping rich get richer. I then moved to Asia and lived there for over 8 years. I learned a lot over there and one thing I saw was how asians love brands and can be addicted to them regardless of quality, although that has changed a bit. Makeup and skincare is popular everywhere and Asians are increasing their usage of perfume too, they did not as much 10 to 15 years ago. 

Coty is the number 1 company in the world when it comes to selling perfume or fragrances. They own their own brands but also own licenses to a lot of other brands.

Covergirl
Kylie cosmetics and Kylieskin
KKW (Kim kardashian)
Burberry (license)
Gucci (license)
Adidas (license) 

Wella (40%) which includes OPI and a lot of stuff many women use at beauty salon and buy at Sally beauty supply, Walgreens etc. 

Over 60 brands which i actually think is too many which is exactly what the new ceo is going to fix. Less brands but more revenues per brand. 

There is a new ceo who was a major boss for L‚ÄôOreal for 20 years and then started her own skincare brand and after 3 years basically was acquihired to join Coty. This is the best decision ever made as the stock went from $30 to $3 on shitty management that did a lot of financial engineering and big deals that ended up costing shareholders a lot.

So, here are the catalyst as to why the february numbers are going to be outstanding. 

The company has added new distributors in europe, in fact one of the largest, that they did not have before.

13% of their sales were online or direct, that will be 20% or more this quarter which improves the top and bottom line. 

Added new team for China, which was badly needed. In fact, made a marketing deal with a top Chinese celeb and within a few hours sold out of the product they were promoting. 

New products are being launched in skincare category. 

Shitty brands are going to be sold which raises cash for the business. 

More aggressive expansion of skincare products which is going to be a faster part of the business that WallStreet is not modeling. 

I can show you why below

Revenue breakdown by product as of the last quarter was the following:
55.8% Fragrance
30.% Color cosmetics
0.3%  Hair
13.7% Skin and Beauty

Geography 
42% USA and Latin America
47% EMEA (Europe)
11% Asia Pacific

If you compare to L‚ÄôOreal which is $200 billion market cap vs. $5 Billion for Coty. 
40% Skincare
21% Haircare
18% Makeup
11% Fragrances
11% Hygiene products

Geography
42% Asia Pacific
24% North America
18% Western Europe
8% Latin America
6% Eastern Europe
3% Africa, Middle East

If you compare these businesses you can see how these are night and day. 
Asia growth is anemic for Coty at 123 mm last quarter and will be the fastest segment of the business for the next 5 years, I expect it can  grow 30% or more a year and be larger than the Americas segment. Thu is because there was little exposure given the lack of offerings in the Skincare. 

Also, beauty products are consumed more frequently than a fragrance. A perfume can last someone a month or 6 months where as a skincare product can last 1 month or maybe 2. It consists of consistent purchases which brings consistent revenues and cash flow to the business something the business needs to improve upon. 

Company has a lot of debt but have paid of $3 billion and will keep paying jt off given the higher profitability. 2.5 billion was from sale of 60% of Wella and $1 was a direct investment from KKr via a convertible bond at $6.24 conversion price. 

Stock is 65% owned by insiders and there js not a lot of shares out there to buy. So, although no squeeze there is definitely scarcity of shares.

Kylie cosmetics and kylieskin have been growing steadily since their international expansion. Ranking as the 22,500 website in the world.  Both Kylie and Kim will help them grow the cosmetics, fragrance and skincare  via a DTC offering. Those businesses by themselves are like MINI Coty‚Äôs as they can sell a lot of stuff under their brand. 

I think the comany will do 20 to 30 cents a share in earnings, wallstreet estimates are 10 to 20 and are all stuck at $6.5 price targets, except Citi which is at $10, she believes turn around is real this time. Stock is still below pre-covid price and can easily go to $10 to $15 on the turnaround taking shape.

Wallstreet is sleeping on this one. I contacted one of the top retail stock analysts, she is on cnbc a lot, and her firm does not cover the stock due to lack of institutional interest. Have LinkedIn messages to prove this but do not want to out her for business reasons. 

This is where the community can come in and buy shares today at $6.90 or options and sell them to the institutions at $15 or higher when they realize what they missed.  

I own the stock and the options. The stock I purchased at $3.33 and still hold and the option I purchased months ago as I felt that WallStreet and main street would catch on to the story but Wells Fargo put out a piece that was quite negative, they are in denial of the turnaround, and has forced consolidation of the stock for months. The reason why I picked the $7 strike js because at the time they were in the money and felt it was a safer bet than say $8 or $10 longer dated calls which started to become too expensive for the risk/reward offered.  

I own 400 contracts cost of .785 per contract with strike of $7 with February 19th as expiration. 

UPDATE 1/29/2020
I have added to my stock position from 12,500 shares to 30,000 shares and added 100 more contracts for a total of 500. 


I feel confident they will do well short-term and long-term when you see the increased growth of online traffic for all their brands online ever since they started selling directly. 

I have so much more info but I can post it in the comments. 

Take care!",2021-02-15 11:16:02
Repost of my oil play dd. Last chance before the train leaves the station.,377,lk1pdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk1pdl/repost_of_my_oil_play_dd_last_chance_before_the/,437,1613378867.0,"(This was posted back when oil was around $50/barrel or so. It is now $60+)

Big oil play

There is an oncoming supply crunch in oil that can‚Äôt be stopped. Oil companies are now trading at a fraction of their former valuations, despite oil beginning to accelerate. Oil will be $80+ by the summer and the super majors will run up 50%+. Options are dirt cheap and unlike the meme companies, these are legit companies that will hold their value in time for the autists to take some gains off the table.

Here is the DD:

Global oil production has been carried by the US for the last decade. However, much of that production increase was achieved via shale/tight oil plays. At our peak, the US was producing 13.1 million barrels per day. 

Due to the pandemic, we shut off a ton of rigs to curb production. This was fine except their is one big problem: legacy declines. Shale wells can decline up to 80-90% in a year, so you can imagine what happens when you pull 75% of your rigs off line. Worse, companies/countries all over the world have significantly reduced capex related to oil during the pandemic.

It‚Äôs very likely that US production falls to 8-9 million barrels per day by the late summer. In that case, global production would be somewhere in the 95 million barrel per day range if cranked to the max. 

Global consumption was 100 million barrels per day in 2019. Since economic activity is essentially oil, if the economy opens up in a big way, supply will fall woefully short.

Fast forward to this summer, where most of the adult population is vaccinated and savings rates are at all time highs due to all the stimulus/unemployment money in the system. Now imagine that covid deaths are near 0 and people aren‚Äôt even getting tested anymore because they got the vaccine. What likely happens? My bet is on a surge in activity akin the the roaring 20s.

The play: 

I‚Äôm personally buying LEAPS in the super majors. I have around 3000 January 2022 $35 BP calls. I also have hundreds of XOM $55 January 2023 calls. Also have RDS $50 calls for January of 2022.

There are other plays in the oil patch but the super majors are the safest bet imo.

TLDR: Oil is going to the moon due to a supply/demand imbalance. Oil majors are still 40% off their 2019 lows and are about to take off.

Also, this is not investment advice. I just like these stocks.

Here are a couple of my positions: [XOM](https://snipboard.io/mhGHV8.jpg) and [BP](https://snipboard.io/RZKCs4.jpg).",2021-02-15 10:47:47

AMC Blockbuster DD,1299,ljz99b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/,399,1613371250.0,"&#x200B;

Disclaimer: None of the following is investment advice. Do your own research.

There's a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it'll pop or it'll dive. This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what's the roadmap to tendies from here on.

**tl;dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet:**

**AMC is not dead, nor will it die anytime soon. There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**

**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**

**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**

Let's start at the beginning:

AMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.

What we know from the Q3 2020 results:

After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.

First domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.

Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres.

March 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.

* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines
* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds
* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.
* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.
* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.
* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.
* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.
* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).
* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m
* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.

Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**

**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**

**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**

**Q&A with myself**

**Are people really returning to theatres?**

Attendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**

**Are people spending at the theatres?**

Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.

In Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.

Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)

Again, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.

**From the Q3 ER call:**

The critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.

There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.

Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.

Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.

Cash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.

**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**

They have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.

**Breaking even?**

In 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.

**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**

They have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).

There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.

**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**

No, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.

**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**

No, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.

**Analyst ratings:**

According to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold

AMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.

**Earnings date: 25 Feb**

&#x200B;

**Major shareholders:**

* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)
* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)
* Mittleman 1%
* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)
* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)
* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%
* Wells Fargo 0.15%
* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)
* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)

**Risks:**

Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.

Debt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.

Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot

&#x200B;

**Catalysts**:

Definite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.

Possible: Esports partnerships

Who knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney

**Other**

* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.
* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.

Banco Macro (BMA) - DD (SUPER LOW PE),16,ljyhs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljyhs2/banco_macro_bma_dd_super_low_pe/,42,1613368908.0,"Some boring ass DD for you all. Afraid this stock doesn't have the high short interest we love so much but here we go. It's off to South America for this one!

Banco Macro is the second largest bank in Argentina. In 2020 it suffered the death of its CEO and suffered hard from the Covid-19 Pandemic so far appearing to have come out at around a breakeven point in terms of income (estimated P/E=0.01) for the year. The stock currently trades at $14.83 with a mkt cap of 1.615BN.

However, and here is why this stock really is a winner, here are the PE/forward PE ratios for 2019 and estimates for 2021 and 2022.

2019 = 1.36

2021 = 3.48

2022 = 2.02

An average of 2.75 for the two coming years. Far far below the industrial standard for banks of the low teens.

The average analyst 1 year price target for this stock is $22.80. Additionally, the reintroduction of a dividend would be a massive boost to the stock and would have a reasonable chance of being a high div yield. The vaccine offers a way out of the pandemic and a fast recovery for the bank.

For its last earnings Macro managed to keep non-performing loans at 1%, below the sector average of 4.5%. Its coverage ratio -- a gauge of liquidity -- held above 300%, far higher than the industry average of 126%.

My PTs:

Level 1 - $25

Level 2 - $50

This does not mean this stock is a definite. Argentina is suffering an inflation crisis and the full outcome of the pandemic is still to be seen. Additionally from a TA perspective, the current price sits near the top of the Bollinger band and has a number of resistances on the way up. It does have high calls activity for April at $17.50 which could be a good sign.

**Conclusion: High growth potential, a big move would almost definitely be a 50%-100% with room for far more in the PE ratios. Element of risk comes due to the financial situation in Argentina which should be weighed in. PSYCH risk is just a concept made up by financial institutions to stop us making millions.**

I plan on taking a small position (around 250 shares) on Monday and some calls.

I made some money on things like TSLA, but I'm a long, am totally gay for Elon, and I've been on here watching y'all awhile.  I haven't done much of the retarded stuff I've read on here (certain option strategies) but might dabble in that a bit.  But with all the recent stuff on everyone's favorite crappy video game store, I'm really curious about some followups.  

For example, if some guy FD'd and made $600,000 in a single bet, awesome.  But that was last year.  Now it's 2021, and it's too late to do anything to affect your 2020 income taxes, except contribute to and IRA (oh, but guess what - you can't even do that because you made too much money).

A long investor doesn't pay income taxes on unrealized gains, but someone who makes $600K on options now suddenly finds themselves in the >35% tax bracket.  I know the math doesn't work exactly this way with tax brackets, so don't bother correcting me in the comments.  I'm in the 35% tax bracket. I know how brackets work.  ü§£

Anyway, assuming someone made multiple 6-digit gains last year.  Like many of us on here, this guy is an amateur investor.  I'm assuming he doesn't geek out on tax stuff.  I'm just GUESSING that he might not have the $100k - $200k in tax to pay the tax man.  I'm (again guessing) that he's taken all of that money and rolled it into his next strategy.

I'm really REALLY curious to see some receipts on that.  What's the followup?  You made $X and then the tax man comes asking for $Y. 

What was THAT like?  Anyone have receipts?  I'm guessing there are some ""OH YEAH"" followed by ""OH NO"" stories.

INTC - Catalysts for a breakout of all time high and the road to Trillion dollar market cap üöÄüöÄüöÄ,42,ljx97i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljx97i/intc_catalysts_for_a_breakout_of_all_time_high/,158,1613365214.0,"Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates. I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

TLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).

&#x200B;

Ill wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.

&#x200B;

Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.

&#x200B;

1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Small side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.

&#x200B;

2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.

&#x200B;

4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).

&#x200B;

In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.

&#x200B;

Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

I get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.

&#x200B;

Don't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.

&#x200B;

Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.

I reiterate my position:

1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.

Using options to play APHA/TLRY arbitrage,128,ljwz0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwz0i/using_options_to_play_aphatlry_arbitrage/,82,1613364372.0,"Using options to play APHA/TLRY arbitrage

For those of you who aren‚Äôt familiar with this situation I will outline a brief summary here. On Dec 16th, it was announced APHA would acquire TLRY through a reverse merger, with the new company trading under the TLRY name. Through this merger, each share of APHA will be converted to 0.8381 shares of the new TLRY ticker. However, there is currently a price dislocation in the market, as APHA closed Friday at 16.94 compared to 29.00 for TLRY. This represents a 30% discount from fair value on APHA.

The obvious trade to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is to put on a long/short pair trade. I‚Äôve seen a few posts outlining this idea already. Basically, it would entail going long 1 share of APHA and short 0.8381 shares of TLRY. Theoretically this would capture the entire 30% dislocation as both companies trend towards their fair conversion ratio. There are, however, a few flaws/risks with this trade that should be considered. 

1. Borrow rates. In order to short TLRY you will need to pay interest to borrow the stock. This interest rate is quoted daily, and has fluctuated between 8-22% this past week (annualized). Assuming the holding period for this trade is 4 months - based on the merger occurring in Q2 - you would be paying 2.5-7.5% in interest at today‚Äôs rates. Now this doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal because we‚Äôre capturing a 30% return right? Sure, assuming rates and share price remain at these levels. Now let‚Äôs assume TLRY continues to squeeze up to 100, now you‚Äôve tripled your short position and need to pay triple the interest. Furthermore, the borrow rate will likely increase with price, and we‚Äôve seen extreme borrow rates before, sometimes even in excess of 100% (GameStop topped 150% for a short period last summer). Very quickly you can see that interest rates have the potential to eat away at your returns.

2. Margin requirements. Along the same lines as my first point, if TLRY squeezes back up to ATHs your broker is going to require significant margin to hold your position. Remember, even though this is theoretically a delta neutral play with the impending merger, your broker won‚Äôt recognize your long APHA position as a hedge against your TLRY short. There could come a point where the margin balance required to hold the trade won‚Äôt justify the max profit potential.

Okay - so how do we play this then?

I‚Äôm suggesting a play that involves going long APHA shares and hedges with ITM TLRY puts. Specifically, let‚Äôs look at the June 100p. It would look something like this using Friday close numbers:

Long 100/0.8381 = 119.32 shares of APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p on TLRY

Premium on the puts is 75.525. 

If, at expiry TLRY trades at or below below 100, then the profit will be:

APHA
(P-16.94)*119.32*0.8381

TLRY
(100-P)*100 - 75.525*100

= 426.26

Essentially what we‚Äôre doing here is paying a slight premium on the put to lock in the short interest rate on TLRY and remove margin risk (we are essentially locking in the margin required for the trade - eliminating the risk of getting margin called if TLRY squeezes). 

Now the beauty of this trade is that you are now also delta positive. Assuming price dislocation does not increase, you are poised to capture another spike in APHA‚Äôs share price, profiting disproportionately on your long shares (because the delta of your TLRY put will trend down). Therefore there could be an opportunity to close the trade early for a profit - but if not you are secured by the fundamentals of the merger conversion ratio at expiry.


I believe using this strategy is at least lower risk than the long/short pair trade. This being said, there is still risk - and that is if for some reason the merger does not go through. This is unlikely, but possible. If this is the case, it is my speculative opinion that APHA will still outperform TLRY. My evidence for this that APHA traded at a higher per share value than TLRY pre-merger announcement in December. Upon announcing the deal, APHA sold off - indicating that the street saw the merger as an over pay for APHA. This assumption could be distorted by the political events that have ensued since that merger (it could be argued that the blue senate disproportionately benefits the American based TLRY compared to the Canadian based APHA). However, it is still my biased opinion that APHA is the better company absence of the merger.

TLDR:

Long 119.32 shares APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p TLRY

**1. Positions**

[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO & XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It‚Äôs because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let‚Äôs compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let‚Äôs look at high margin tech anyways.

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don‚Äôt ask me how I did that, the answer either won‚Äôt impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what‚Äôs important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn‚Äôt change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct >20% because of some black swan (I mean it‚Äôs 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king‚Äôs girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you‚Äôre thinking; ‚Äúbut but... they‚Äôll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!‚Äù \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won‚Äôt and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They‚Äôre not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn‚Äôt stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you‚Äôre not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug‚Äôs closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you‚Äôre not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?

NIO: 100% SUVs

Xpeng: 40% SUVs

Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking ‚ÄúWell, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.‚Äù Fine, let‚Äôs take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.

Let‚Äôs break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs

Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800

\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s

\- Charger network: 20,000+

NIO EC6

\- Price: \~$57,200

\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s

\- Charger network: 290+

Xpeng G3 520

\- Price: \~$30,580

\- Range: 520 km

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s

\- Charger network: 866+

You may be thinking the G3 520‚Äôs price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you‚Äôll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.

‚ÄúBut JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It‚Äôs perfect for China‚Äôs dense cities!‚Äù If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That‚Äôs why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I‚Äôd rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can‚Äôt even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I‚Äôm Chinese and know some first hand) don‚Äôt want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.

Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla‚Äôs network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

‚ÄúBut JJ‚Ä¶ China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!‚Äù Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.

Solar & batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn‚Äôt make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.

Oh and let‚Äôs not forget about autonomy‚Ä¶ no, let‚Äôs forget about it (for now).

International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a ""made in china"" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.

Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it‚Äôll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was ""made in china"" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).

Let‚Äôs look at the current state of margins.

Q3 2020 Gross Margins

\- Tesla: 23.5%

\- Nio: 12.9%

\- Xpeng: 4.6%

\- Li Auto: 19.8%

We‚Äôll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it‚Äôs not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla‚Äôs solar & battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.

‚ÄúBut JJ, that‚Äôs not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!‚Äù First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier ‚Äúramp‚Äù years.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

2015: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you‚Äôre thinking. Well, let‚Äôs we take a look under the hood, you won‚Äôt find Trayvon Martin.

\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the ‚Äúskateboard‚Äù design, saying it‚Äôs obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!

\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.

[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)

Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?

\- Tesla‚Äôs electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.

\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron‚Äôs fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.

\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources

\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network

\- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*

\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn‚Äôt trust Nio and Xpeng‚Äôs software with your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs life

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let‚Äôs not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I‚Äôm no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it‚Äôs peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I‚Äôll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I‚Äôve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",2021-02-15 06:34:24
DD on BALY,60,ljwpzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwpzo/dd_on_baly/,34,1613363630.0,"This is my first DD on any stock. I wrote it up for a friend, and he suggested I post it on Reddit. Feel free to criticize any part of the DD, and I will use it as a learning experience. My main goal is to be able to learn how to identify investment opportunities. I am not a financial advisor. This is purely for entertainment purposes only. Do your own DD before you make any decisions.

Disclaimer: I own 60 shares of BALY (I know I'm a small player...trying to grow one play at a time).

So, a friend of mine, who works and lives in Atlantic City, NJ, mentioned that Bally's (a casino in Atlantic City) has been on a spending spree lately. He sent me this article. [Bally's acquires SportCaller free-play game provider](https://apnews.com/article/atlantic-city-sports-betting-46689f9a2b6421467ce415db076ebe9b)

What caught my eye was this paragraph: ""SportCaller is but the latest acquisition for Bally's which recently added BetWorks and Monkey Knife Fight."" It was interesting that a casino was purchasing Sports related assets. In light of the success of DKNG, this was intriguing to me. So, I started to dig deeper.

Here is a timeline of the acquistions:

April 2020:

[Caeser's sold Bally's Atlantic City to Twin River Worldwide Holdings for $25million](https://www.nj.com/atlantic/2020/04/ballys-atlantic-city-sold-for-25m-casino-plans-to-reopen-after-coronavirus.html)

October 2020:

[Twin River buys the naming rights of Bally's for $20million](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/10186/twin-river-chairman-purchases-rights-to-ballys-brand)

[Twin River Buys Bally's Brand from Caesars for $20 Million, Will Rename Most TRWH Casinos](https://www.casino.org/news/ballys-brand-sold-by-caesars-to-twin-river-for-20-million/)

November 2020:

[Sinclair RSN naming rights pocketed by Bally's in 'US$85m' deal](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/11/19/sinclair-signs-naming-rights-deal-with-bally.html)

January 2021:

[Bally's, Caesers Entertainment add daily fantasy sports deals](https://apnews.com/article/sports-rhode-island-fantasy-sports-atlantic-city-media-1ce0737430fb81528ea74f1127c027b2)

February 2021:

[Bally's acquires SportCaller free-play game provider](https://apnews.com/article/atlantic-city-sports-betting-46689f9a2b6421467ce415db076ebe9b)

Putting all this together, this is what it looks like to me. An ambitious play by a little known branded casino to use the brand recognition of the Bally‚Äôs name to compete on the ever expanding online sports betting arena. I believe if they are able to execute on their plan to enter and grab market share in the blooming online sports betting arena, this stock has an opportunity to return capital.

Some additional notes, it's a relatively thin stock. Only 30.46 outstanding shares. BETZ, the Roundhill Sports Betting ETF, reported the addition of BALY to its holdings in January ([link to source here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sports-betting-etf-adds-4-new-components-including-another-spac-2021-01-19)) ([BETZ holdings](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/betz/full-holdings)) . They report earnings March 04, 2021. Market Cap as of 2/12/2021: $1.83B. (Market cap of DKNG as of 2/12/21: $23.92B, not saying this will be DKNG, but helpful to know). Reported earnings 2020: Q1: $109m, Q2: $28m, Q3: $116m.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! Any and all criticisms and praise welcome.

Edit:

TLDR: I think BALY is undervalued. They are trying to take on the likes of DKNG. Should be valued higher. Buy Low Sell High!

Today I‚Äôm talking about this wacky boomer concept called ‚Äúdiver-fish-fry-cation‚Äù. And not through some boring ass boomer stock that doesn‚Äôt have triple digit IV, that‚Äôs for impotent donkey faced losers. I‚Äôm talking about the glamorous world of real estate, now here‚Äôs some emojis: üöÄüöÄüöÄüìàüí∞üí¶üçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜ most of you can‚Äôt read anyway. 

# WHAT THE FUCK IS A ‚ÄúREAL ESTATE‚Äù? IS THAT LIKE A ROBLOX HOUSE FOR LOSERS? 

Yes, it‚Äôs exactly like your dope Minecraft village but actual alive humans pay you money to live there. 

Disclaimer: I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED ITS NOT ‚ÄúEXACTLY LIKE THAT‚Äù AND THAT IF YOU FILL AN ACTUAL APARTMENT BUILDING WITH BEES, and/or LAVA YOU MAY INCURR LEGAL LIABILITIES and/or BE CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IANAL (your mom). 

Ok so obviously there are some stupid limitations because of ‚Äúlaws‚Äù and ‚Äúethics‚Äù ( fucking üåàüêª) but the demand for housing isn‚Äôt going away any time soon and despite what the government said last week about how ‚Äúthis is definitely not a bubble, there is no war in ba-sing-sae, some animals are more equal than others‚Äù (I can‚Äôt read that might not be what they said) at some point the eviction/foreclosure moratorium is either going to be kicked forward (again) or will actually end ( why does this angry phantom keep screaming ‚Äú2008‚Äù in my ear this is [nothing ](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-mortgage-debt/) like that). And yes I know this bull market is going to run forever and our system is now ‚ÄúTotally Secure Don‚Äôt Worry ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù but speaking as someone who‚Äôs now lived through 3 ‚Äúonce in lifetime‚Äù financial calamities I‚Äôm not entirely sold on the never ending prosperity thing. This is a really long winded way of saying that rental property may not be a terrible investment in the near future, to circle back to my original point. 

# BUT I DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO BUY A RENTAL PROPERTY OUTRIGHT AND THE BANK DOESN‚ÄôT RECOGNIZE MY INCOME FROM GIVING HANDJOBS BEHIND THIS WENDY‚ÄôS. HOW CAN I BENEFIT FROM THIS? 
 

There are a few ways to easily enter this market: 

>  1). Try to be born into a family where you can inherit a large sum of money, this is a very good strategy and has paid off very well historically. If you‚Äôve already done this skip to the next section, good job. 

>  2). Have a large sum of money and/or income from another source, perhaps move to a country such as Holland where there‚Äôs a more progressive view of your chosen profession. 

>  3). A Face/off situation where you steal a landlords identity. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen the seminal classic starring Nic Cage and John Travolta and it‚Äôs not necessary to explain this reference any further. 
TLDR: this is called a barrier to entry. 

>  4). Squat in a house and air bnb it (note: this is wildly illegal and I do not encourage this behavior, I am not however legally required to pretend that wouldn‚Äôt be funny as fuck) 

# WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MONEY OR FORECLOSURES MY BRAIN HURTS FROM ALL THESE WORDS AHHHHH PLEASE JUST SHUT UP JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP 



Anyway, while there‚Äôs been a moratorium on foreclosures, there hasn‚Äôt been a moratorium on banks doing literally *everything* up to actually beginning the proceedings. Which means that when the moratorium actually ends these cases are all free to be finished rapidly en-mass, coupled with an overall uptrend in housing prices this seems like it could create a buying opportunity because it doesn‚Äôt seem like the balance of delinquent to current mortgages is enough to collapse the market (not an expert, I‚Äôm an idiot, this is speculative).
If housing prices rise you can charge more for rent. 
If housing prices fall because of overall instability in the market, you have a larger stream of potential tenants. I see it as a win-win. 
‚Ä¢ My primary apprehension would be the bottom falling out of the market, but it would most likely recover *eventually* and let‚Äôs be real I‚Äôm not talking about renting fancy-lad houses with ‚Äúupdated appliances‚Äù and ‚Äúindoor plumbing‚Äù or anything so just BTFD.

# SO WHAT, THIS IS SOME SORT OF YOLO FOR RICH PEOPLE? MY NET-WORTH IS $5 AND A USED CONDOM WRAPPER WHY THE FUCK WOULD I CARE?

I get it BANG going tits up hit you hard, you maxed your credit card to buy GME @ $380, now your loan shark has repossessed your kidney and your first born child. Maybe start a go-fund-me, or an only fans for ape enthusiasts I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm not your life coach? Have you tried option 1 in that previous section? I really recommend that one. Maybe convince some of your roblox friends to go in on this investment with you. 

But I digress, 
Tldr; 

I‚Äôm not entirely sure where I‚Äôm going with this but it seems like this could be a really profitable market to jump into now especially if you‚Äôre feeling the üåàüêªitis
