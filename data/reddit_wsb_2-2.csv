This DD post is primarily to ask the mods what is allowed at WSB anymore.  Are we allowed to post any plays other than GME? Are we allowed to have diversified holdings of risky bets? 

I made my shiny metal post on Wednesday and had no idea it would get the attention that it did. I’m an average autist and I’m willing to speak to any mods if they want to set something up.  

The religiousity and cultishness in here is getting out of hand. 

God forbid someone post a play about tesla or Microsoft calls or even a bearish play on anything.

I miss WSB of two weeks ago where it was all actual debate or funny memes and rockets.  Now it’s all conspiracy theory memes and panic and only GME posts are allowed.

Feel free to change the post flair mods, it’s only related to DD in that I’m asking if we are allowed to post anything other than GME DD",2021-02-02 03:19:08

Buying at the ask and selling at the bid because the fomo monster got you by the dick. Let me give the young accounts a market lesson real quick. 

**Time in the market > timing the market**

You wanna make money - I get that. You wanna double your money too - hell maybe triple it - this year. How many trades have you done since Jan 1st? 10? 20? **30?** Have you doubled?

Did you know you can double your account with 7ish 10% moves? Yeah, you’re gonna have some big boy wins, and a bunch of 20s and 30s if you’re good, but if you made more than 7 moves and didn’t double your money you’re either too greedy and missing peaks or losing too much.

1,000 invested, with ONLY 10% wins:

1) 1,100
2) 1,210
3) 1,331
4) 1,464.10
5) 1,610.51
6) 1,771.56
7) 1,948.71
8) 2,143.58

I fall victim to this shit too. I’m up 20% and I get greedy and it drops to -40% and then I gotta manage my position so I don’t get clapped. Go slow, be vigilant, make money with purpose not by accident or a roll of the dice. 

TL;DR. - less trades, more wins. Win % beat occasionally baggers in the long run for most investors.",2021-02-02 03:09:20

I'm down on what's in play, but overall way ahead. 

\----

 Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why? 

What you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already. 

**There's still time to limit your downside risk**

Gains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.  

**THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE**

I'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their homes...it's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.  

**Wallstreetbets is not some magical subreddit with inside info and guaranteed path to millions** 

there are some very smart people here, don't get me wrong. I've made a lot of money that i never would have had i not dug into the info that I was first exposed to here.  But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME. 

**NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD**

It's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period. 

**Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against**

Shares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked. 

&#x200B;

BE SAFE. BE SMART. RISK ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE. 

TL/DR: Think for yourself and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance. There are people acting in their own best interests who need you to act in a certain way in order for it to work. This is a zero-sum game. if there's going to be winners, there have to be losers.",2021-02-02 03:05:55

A quick word about the current silver situation. (DD),0,la7ua3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7ua3/a_quick_word_about_the_current_silver_situation_dd/,82,1612227333.0,"Despite all the shit being tossed around here about silver, here is the deal.

There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.

TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.

>In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience

Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!

Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.

If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.

>**Constraints in Supply**Why can’t we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot “fix” the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17 – $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.

***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -> 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***

My smooth brain tells me the short ladder attack is causing the decrease and the increase is driven by a huge and steady demand from retail. The stocks being shorted are being bought! HFs are pushing it down and retail are holding the line, adding to their positions. 

This is coiled up like a spring, and could reach beyond the moon.

I can't put my finger right on it, but I know I'm not the only one that feels something is off

Way too suddenly, too many ""people"" all too surely show up - not to join the loud growing GME party - but to forcefully try and change the party mid-way

It's just not natural

Anybody would either come here and join or get out of the way/watch, not somehow change the tune

Then, SLV just magically pops ~7% like the next day or two - which is something WSB absolutely cannot do - we barely got tiny little GME off the ground after months of DD and argument

Nothing about this feels genuine

I don’t know if y’all are seein them do some sneaky shit with Progressive... I’ve been watching it HARD for months. It’s dipped 11.7% in the last month. Same time frame as this GME shit. Coincidence? Maybe. I’m starting to think these hedge funds that got clapped decided to hold their growth stocks and sell off their value to pay down GME.

> The 16 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Progressive Corp have a median target of 97.50, with a high estimate of 128.00 and a low estimate of 87.00.

We were expecting a short ladder attack. It has happened every day since Wednesday 1/27.

We won last week. We made all calls between 115 and 320 strike expire in the money. That means MM has to buy shares in order to hedge against those expired ITM calls.

It can happen anytime TODAY or TOMORROW.

Chamath didnt give RH the benefit of the doubt and went straight on media to blast the company to get retailers on his side.

Why would he do that?  
1-**He is also running for Gov of CA so he needs the attention of the people.**

Having retail on his side makes it much easier for him to win.

**2- chamath shills sofi (IPOE SPAC ) which also sells order flow.**

I am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.   


I hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it. 

Paper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\* DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.

If people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.   


Silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,   


This is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.   


My suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on. I truly believe this is a fake out, and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the PM space.

GM just made this announcement for 2035 and the stock market loves it. Ford is already rumored to be building an electric F-150 for 2023 and as much as I love Pappa Musk and his Cybertruck I think this is really going to be popular with average American consumers. Ford is also making the electric Mustang SUV and I know a lot of people are pissed about the use of the Mustang name but in all honesty that car looks bad ass.

I like this options play because the spread for options dated two years out is really tight. I understand this is because the volatility is low and the chances of Ford hitting that price are remote but I'd gander that's in the absence of new information about an all electric lineup.

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits.

MORE TRICKERY: GME attack explained,208,la6ibw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6ibw/more_trickery_gme_attack_explained/,30,1612224139.0,"REPOST FROM FRIDAY NOW THAT IT'S RELEVANT. u/SNICKYSNACKS THE PREDICTOR. 

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.




**TL;DR**
>Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

>They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

Do not fear and panic sell. If you pay attention to most stocks trending on WSB, they were moving up and down simultaneously. When GME was down like 100 points AMC was down 10 points and BB 7 points. When GME moved up a little bit AMC, BB would also move up. Wall Street is trying to get you to Sell after a big dip and a little recovery. Psychologically they WANT TO. Scare you

since last week being manipulated by Wall Street. 

With the restriction of how much you can buy is restricting your gains and causing you manipulated losses. YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL!

TIME is the enemy for Wall Street because they can continue restricting purchase and manipulating the price down but they still have to cover and pay interest 

With the restrictions of how much you can purchase, I would load up on GME first and then AMC. Or whatever you can get your hands on

JUST HOLD AND BUY! We are going to 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕",2021-02-02 02:02:08
Thanks for the ride GME gang. I haven't had this much fun since MSTX.,37,la6hvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6hvu/thanks_for_the_ride_gme_gang_i_havent_had_this/,48,1612224113.0,"I bought GME as a value play last year. I bought more after the earnings crash and got really excited when Cohen came on the board. I figured that I was all set, that my $18 avg cost shares would soon be worth $50 or even $60. Wow what a return! Then I heard about the squeeze thesis. I figured it was WSB nonsense, but buyers are buyers. I wrote [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5zmcd/exactly_how_the_gme_squeeze_will_go_for_you/) and you degenerates seemed to love it. I didn't know how close to right I would be.

It’s been a wild ride, but today [I took 90% of my profits off the table](https://imgur.com/gallery/eJxs0It). I sold a good chunk of my shares last week to regain my initial investment (you should always risk manage) and let the rest ride. I still have ten shares and really hope that they go to $1000 or more. I’m taking a safer long position by selling $40p weeklies. I’ll be buying in post-squeeze regardless of what happens. But in the meantime I’ll be using my gains to pay off student loans and live a debt-free life.
 

Why did I do this? When I see crowds ignoring information just because they don’t like it, I get scared. S3 came out with some numbers over the weekend that indicate a lot of shorts have covered. Is that solid? I don’t know. But it’s enough to tell me I should be cautious. Nearly 60k out of the sky is something I’d be stupid to let slip away. If you have money you NEED in GME, please take it back. Let your winnings ride, but don’t risk your mortgage. Buffett says to be fearful when others are exuberant and exuberant when others are fearful. GME gang is just too exuberant for me.
 
Plays like GME come once or twice in a lifetime, and I just don’t feel comfortable risking (for me) life-changing money on a chance that it’ll become slightly more life-changing. I wish you well. I look forward to seeing the gain porn if I’m missing out on something huge. Please be careful, please stick around if you intend to be a positive part of WSB post-GME. Please fuck off if you don’t. 
 
I hope the squeezening happens and makes you all rich. Now go learn what an FD is.

EDIT: Apparently this is one of the most controversial posts on Reddit in the last hour. I didn't even know they did that kind of analytics. If you're downvoting someone who's telling you they just changed their life because they're not risking their future on the same thing as you, ask yourself why that makes you angry. I'm still long GME. I think that Ryan Cohen is going to do incredible things to the company, and I'm still risking my money on that belief. So why are you mad?",2021-02-02 02:01:53

From all the media manipulation, trading app closings, and other shenanigans from the hedgefucks, the most “sensitive” and objective of them all is the short ladder attack. Oh did I lost you, you cute smooth brain ? ELI5 here it goes : whales short a small amount of actions between them repeatedly so the algorithm thinks action going down. But guess what... IT IS NOT. 

“But oh fucking retard”, you might say, “how do we know if the dip is actually a BS short ladder ?” LOOK AT THE VOLUME TRADED!!

Not sure if this applies to other brokers. I can give TDA the benefit of doubt, since them still allow GME stock trading.

What this means is that MMs like Citadel now have a monopoly on GME options selling. They have jacked up option prices to obscene levels. That in itself should make gamma squeeze harder to trigger, and I bet they figured out other ways to avoid another gamma squeeze on GME as much as possible. Currently there are 6600+ open interest on GME 02/05 800c. Citadel could easily have made 50 million++ on this. Paying interest on shorting GME is a piece of cake in comparison.

Position: 800 GME.

GME short interest news - use with caution,121,la654r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la654r/gme_short_interest_news_use_with_caution/,58,1612223273.0,"Before going into news about short interest, I want to make clear that this data is generally not exhaustive and can never be seen as real-time. Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.

Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.

According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.

However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.

The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.

GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.

Sorry if this has been posted in the meantime. I always take my time writing posts because I crosscheck with other information sources available to me.

\#WeLikeTheStock

\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth. The best rocket is the one in your portfolio.",2021-02-02 01:47:53

Many of you smart traders are switching to platforms such as Fidelity and Vanguard that will let you trade what you want.  Unlike Robinhood, I know Fidelity doesn't have limited margin because I myself switched to Fidelity from Robinhood a year ago.  What does this mean?  It means if I did a deposit into Fidelity today, it might take a day or two for the funds to clear into the account.  Fidelity will NOT let you trade funds that haven't cleared.  So for instance we're seeing a dip in $GME today.  I wouldn't be shocked to see it stay down until Wednesday when people's funds clear and they can buy again.  Same with the other 3, if they take a dip after I post this don't be shocked and don't panic sell either.

The total since 9:30 is less than 2 million. Think logically, if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million. There is 7.9 million retards in here. If we all panicked the volume would go through the roof.

This is another attack by hedge funds to force a sell-off and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling.

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED LONGER THAN THEY REMAIN SOLVENT

EDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post. However, there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount.

Notice the huge red dildo staring at your face. Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.

The truth is here in this subreddit - The Short Squeeze hasn't happened,6298,la5ln2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5ln2/the_truth_is_here_in_this_subreddit_the_short/,477,1612221992.0,"Just so we can plan this out - much of what you read here at the top is truth. Some sprinkling of bullshit but truth for the most part. I've been seeing articles on major news about The Short Squeeze happened and What we learned from the Short Squeeze and all of that... the fact is, we are still knee deep in Short Squeeze. So let's lay the media lies out there:

1. The Short Squeeze isn't an event that just ends, it's an event that happens. You'll know when it happens and you'll physically see it happen here.
2. No one here is buying silver. If you have it great! But no one is buying shares of SLV. CNN reported it jumped 8%... bullshit. Notice the Silver shit started after the markets closed... it's a campaign to get people thinking silver is the new gold on Monday. Remember - you can buy Silver or you can keep buying  **💎🖐** (Not financial advice. I don't own a stake in any diamond mines)
3. The Hedgies have not sold out of their positions in GME. That is misinformation. They simply cannot which is one reason why people think RH is limiting trading. If they lower the stocks prices, it's going to be cheaper for the Hedgies when they are forced to purchase and spike GME leaving us with winners and losers, but as long as they lose, we all win.
4. The media, the Hedgies, the brokers... they are working against us. We need to support each other. 

I know that there is a lot of retarded talk and this is in no way financial advice. I didn't even talk about buying anything... I'm just here with some solid consolidation of who you can trust and as many retards are here... most of these people you can trust cause they aren't smart enough to fool you.

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

The Article, Copy/Pasta:

 GRAPEVINE, Texas, Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop proudly announced today that it has received a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality. This marks the eighth consecutive year that GameStop has earned top marks in the annual workplace campaign.  


“Receiving this award and designation as a *Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality* is an honor for GameStop,” says George Sherman, chief executive officer for GameStop. “Our values compel us to be the voice, commit to inclusion, and personify respect. At GameStop, we act on this through championing causes for the LGBTQ community, and all those committed to improving and protecting the rights of every human.”

“From the previously unimaginable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to a long overdue reckoning with racial injustice, 2020 was an unprecedented year. Yet, many businesses across the nation stepped up and continued to prioritize and champion LGBTQ equality,” said Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President. “This year has shown us that tools like the CEI are crucial in the work to increase equity and inclusion in the workplace, but also that companies must breathe life into these policies and practices in real and tangible ways. Thank you to the companies that understand protecting their LGBTQ employees and consumers from discrimination is not just the right thing to do—but the best business decision.”

The results of the 2021 CEI showcase how 1,142 U.S.-based companies are not only promoting LGBTQ-friendly workplace policies in the U.S., but also for the 57% of CEI-rated companies with global operations who are helping advance the cause of LGBTQ inclusion in workplaces abroad. GameStop’s efforts in satisfying all of the CEI’s criteria earned a 100 percent ranking and the designation as one of the *Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality*.

The CEI rates employers providing these crucial protections to over 18 million U.S. workers and an additional 17 million abroad. Companies rated in the CEI include Fortune magazine’s 500 largest publicly traded businesses, American Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (AmLaw 200), and hundreds of publicly and privately held mid- to large-sized businesses.

The CEI rates companies on detailed criteria falling under four central pillars:

* Non-discrimination policies across business entities
* Equitable benefits for LGBTQ workers and their families
* Supporting an inclusive culture
* Corporate social responsibility

I suggest the following or something similar:

* New post flair for non-meme stock DD and Discussion. Meme stock posts with this flair should be deleted.

* AutoMod should delete comments in Daily Discussion and non-meme stock posts that mention meme stocks.

The ""meme stocks"" filter should be a dynamic list and updated as needed - starting with GME and, maybe, AMC.

Death and Taxes,439,la4ahu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4ahu/death_and_taxes/,79,1612218632.0,"Good morning autists! Due to the large influx of new users, I think it's a good idea to go over a *very* important aspect of trading -- taxes.

Now, there have been multitudes of sick gains posted over the past weeks. You may be thinking of dropping yours on a new Lambo, and rightly so, but before you do, make sure you determine how deep the Tax Man is going to have his hand in your pockets come next year.

&#x200B;

# Capital Gains

A Capital gain is exactly what you should expect: a gain realized from trading something of value. When you bought 1 GME share for $20 and sold for $500, you realized a $480 capital gain.

Capital gains are taxed through two different schedules in the U.S.: Long-term Capital Gains tax and Short-term Capital Gains tax. Again, as you might suspect, these taxes are applied based on how long you held the capital. **To qualify for the long-term capital gains tax, you must hold the capital for more than one year**. Everything else is taxed as short-term.

Note that this only applies to those without 💎👐, as you are only taxed on gains made from closing a position (*realized* gains).

&#x200B;

# Long-term Capital Gains

Now, if you saw the original comment by our lord and savior u/DeepFuckingValue and jumped in at the same time, you would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax:

&#x200B;

|$ Amount|Tax Rate|
|:-|:-|
|$0 - $40,000|0%|
| $40,000 - $441,450 |15%|
| $441,450 - ∞ |20%|

The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

&#x200B;

# Short-term Capital Gains

I would imagine that most of you did *not* jump in with DFV over a year ago, and thus are subject to the short-term capital gains tax. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income, meaning that it is summed with any additional income you make throughout the year at a regular job.

&#x200B;

|$ Amount|Tax Rate|
|:-|:-|
| 0 - $9,875 |10%|
| $9,876 - $40,125 |12%|
| $40,126 - $85,525 |22%|
| $85,526 - $163,300 |24%|
| $163,301 - $207,350 |32%|
| $207,351 - $518,400 |35%|
| $518,400 - ∞|37%|

The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

There is a caveat to the tax brackets above -- Federal income tax is applied at a *progressive rate*. 

If you make $100,000 at your job this year and a $70,000 short-term gain with GME, you might expect to pay a 32% tax and owe $54,400. However, you actually would only owe $35,415.50. 

The progressive rate schedule means that the first $9,875 you earn is taxed at 10%, then the next $30,249 ($40,125 - the $9876 which was already taxed at 10%) is taxed at 12%, then the next $45,399 is taxed at 22%, and so on.

&#x200B;

As you can see, it is much more tax advantageous to hold. Even the federal government wants you to hold. **SO HOLD.**

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am not a tax professional. This only applies to U.S. residents. The information herein is only in respect to **Federal** tax. There may or may not be state-specific tax as well. There are *many* other factors that may increase or decrease your taxable income. Certain equities/equity derivatives are taxed differently than stated above. If you made bank over the past few weeks, **TALK TO A CPA**. My limited knowledge of tax law could be wrong -- if you see a mistake, leave a comment and I will correct it.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr:** [Ben Franklin once wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_taxes_(idiom)) that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except **death and taxes.** Do not spend all of your gains without accounting for taxes. The tax man *will* have you pay in some form or fashion; whether it's in cash, repossession, wage garnishment, or jail is up to you.

This morning I read an article in a newspaper about how ''redditors are collectively hopping on the silver train''. The article in question was from FD, basically the Dutch Financial Times.

It's about the following article;[https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt](https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt)

&#x200B;

We all know damn well that the ones who bought GME are still holding it, and that no OG WSB member cares about SLV. So I asked them about their sources to justify an article about Redditors buying silver and they replied with these two sources. They basically said that they get first hand information from analysts and that they are not writing anything that is not truthful. Additionally they said they are aware of the market sentiment but that they are also aware of ''redditors driving  up the price of silver''. I sent them eight of the most popular posts of WSB of the past 24 hours to point out the market sentiment (which is GME). They provided these sources for their article;

1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the\_real\_dd\_on\_slv\_the\_worlds\_biggest\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/)
2. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the\_biggest\_short\_squeeze\_in\_the\_world\_slv\_silver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/)

&#x200B;

The truth your $GME sell limit orders keep getting removed - IMPORTANT,514,la42h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la42h4/the_truth_your_gme_sell_limit_orders_keep_getting/,155,1612218000.0,"When you place a sell limit order, the broker you use might not be able to lend your shares to the shorters anymore. This might be the reason why some brokers are now removing your sell orders, because by removing your sell order, they can lend your shares to the shorters (without you realizing). 

Put your sell limit orders at $4K - $5K, or tell your broker to stop lending your shares out. 

There is debate whether or not putting sell limit orders will stop brokers from lending out shares. But at this situation, I find it very odd that many sell orders are suddenly removed without consent. Guess theory does come alive after all, shorters need more shares ;)

And that is exactly the point.  All infinity squeezes are the result of heavy over-shorting of shares which then become difficult or impossible to cover.  Such aggressive over-shorting only occurs when the bear thesis against the fundamentals is conclusively strong and very well disseminated. In other words, stocks which appear to be the “best short ideas” are also the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes.

GME: Evidence of Short Seller Collusion (for Months) and an Explanation for Why Short Estimates are Probably Way Off!,108,laqa34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laqa34/gme_evidence_of_short_seller_collusion_for_months/,16,1612279820.0,"MODS: THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE

So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that ""short interest is going down"" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?

Let me explain:

Today, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \~$14, \~20$, and around \~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:

&#x200B;

*Processing img lmjh2m5bn0f61...*

At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.

So why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:

Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.

Here is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest ""in theory"" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!

Now you might ask ""what if all of the short interest is artificial?"", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!

How do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:

1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)
2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:

[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)

As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!

What I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of ""short selling"" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:

1. They are probably scared of getting caught!

2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).

3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!

Also, note that shorts don't have to ""borrow and sell"" to each other to create a ladder, they can just ""buy and sell"" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!

Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!

**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.**

Hopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!",2021-02-02 17:30:20

The SEC demands to know every time an issuer issues registered shares and the issuer needs your blessing. Does not a shareholder or a company's management have the right to know every time the DTCC illegally issues unregistered shares without an exemption or your permission? Should an investor file a 13-d when he reaches 5% ownership of the issued # of shares of a company or 5% of the total amount of shares, real and fake, at the DTCC? Does a person become an affiliate or ""control"" person when he owns 10% of the issued shares of a public corporation or 10% of the total shares represented as being owned on monthly brokerage statements to shareholders? Which # does Rule 16 (a) refer to? Should every person ever fined for 13 d or 16a violations appeal these fines, look at the # of ""counterfeit"" shares in existence at the DTCC at the time of the alleged violation, and recalculate what % of the TOTAL # of shares, real and fake, he really did have control of?

All one has to do is go through the '34 Exchange Act, rule by rule and regulation by regulation, to see how undermined these securities laws really are when unregistered, unrestricted, dividend lacking, vote missing, and basically nonexistent ""pseudo-shares"" fill the computer banks at the DTCC as well as the monthly brokerage statements of investors who THOUGHT they had bought real ""packages of rights"" (shares) in a public corporation. People that think that they own 1% of the shares of a public corporation may only own one-fourth of that and the one-fourth of 1% ownership share is of a greatly damaged company and not the company that was ""advertised"".

Oh right, you're an illiterate 🦍. Whatever, let me help you out.

# Common lil bitch questions:

**Q: I'm seeing red in my account ohmygodwhatishappening**

**A:** Holy 𝒻𝓊𝒸𝓀. We've explained this before. Your brain must be polished all nice and shiny. Let me help you out.

Firstly, we've got to explain the basics. What happens when a stock price goes down? Well, that means that there are more sellers than buyers. That should be obvious. A larger supply and less demand means that the value of the product in question goes down until supply and demand balance out.

Now that you understand what's been driving economies since the first hairless 🦍🦍 decided to trade a mango for a handy, take a look at [this post showing volume for the day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Do you see a large supply? No? That's right, you cute little drooling potato. All of you 💎👐 absolute CHADS out there, you're doing great. Keep it up sweethearts. Nobody is selling.

So then why is price going down? Well, there's this thing called a short ladder attack.

**Q: That sounds complicated! What's a sho-**

shut the fuck up and let me finish. Don't interrupt me again or I'm gonna give DFV's address to your wife, and we'll see how long she stays with you.

A short ladder attack is when two big whales (read: Melvin and his wife's boyfriend) sell stocks to each other, rapidly, at decreasing values. Remember when I told you about supply and demand? This is an artificial inflation of supply without demand increasing along with it. What does that do to the price? It drops it.

Short ladder attacks are not effective in one of two situations. Either there's a third whale (the guy that fucks Melvin's boyfriend - I know this a complicated love triangle but keep up) who matches the artificial supply with their demand, and they buy up the short ladder attacks. Or, there's too much volume in the stock, and the tiny dick plays being done by Melvin and his wife's boyfriend isn't increasing the supply for the stock in any meaningful way. We actually have seen examples of both.

First off, on [Thursday](https://imgur.com/a/WyTu1BT) **BEFORE** Robinfuckyou locked GME buying down, you see the insane volume? Melvin's short ladder attacks were entirely ineffective, as the volume of their short ladder was tiny in comparison to the real trades (mostly buying) that were happening. You see what happened right after the lockout? Volume stayed high as people bought the dip - but then, almost like magic, as the volume flatlined, the decent to Thursday's closing price of $197 began. People weren't selling, but Melvin's short ladder attacks became very effective as Robinhood users suddenly couldn't match the demand of the previous hours. Melvin's short ladder attacks went from a very small volume in comparison to real trades, to very large volume in comparison to real trades, and we've been seeing this ever since.

Secondly, remember how I mentioned a short ladder attack can be countered by a third whale buying to match the increased artificial supply? We saw this on Friday, as we fought to hold levels above $320. We were expecting a massive short ladder attack right before market close, and we got it - but a whale jumped in and gobbled up every single share that Melvin and his wife's boyfriend put up for sale. [Kjetille Stjerne](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/) and his friends claimed credit, and perhaps they did, there's no way of knowing right now - what we do know however, is that whoever Ancient Omega Level God whale bought up those shares was, they saved our asses on Friday and kept closing price above $320. [Just look at the volume spike right before close.](https://imgur.com/a/DQP3VaG) Melvin definitely trying some 🌈🐻 shit, but the aforementioned whale kept us above water.

You can speak now.

**Q: Okay, so I get what short ladder attacks are, and I see how they're affecting the price. But what's to stop 🌈🐻 Melvin from doing this until the price hits $0?**

That's actually a great question! There's 3 factors at play here that prevent this from happening.

Firstly retail investors buying. This provides a small, but steady pushback against the short ladder attacks. Its like a guy falling from the sky. Without retail investors (the parachute) he goes into an utter free fall and fucking dies. With retail investors (again, the parachute), that decent isn't stopped, but its slowed. **Its important to note that retail investor buy pressure would normally outweigh the short ladder attacks, but Robinhood's limitations are stopping too many from buying**. Hopefully we'll see the buy pressure from retail increase as people are able to swap cash over from their Robinhood account to Fidelity/Vanguard, but for now, there's still lots of people stuck in limbo (cash is still in the transfer phase). This pressure will be released like a fat nut after blue balling for 6 hours if Robinhood allows unlimited buying again, but we shouldn't count on that. Its important to note (I actually highlighted this on the Friday chart on the dip) that you beautiful, gorgeous autists aren't selling, but rather buying the dips. We can see proof of that via lack of volume during price free falls, and then an increase in volume as people buy the fucking dip. If you're ever worried about your fellow autists selling, just pay attention to volume. It'll tell you everything you need to know.

Secondly, whales buying. Again, I touched on this talking about Kjetille Stjerne on Friday, but the fact of the matter is that in these tiny volume situations, large buys from whales can affect the price. And I mean REALLY affect the price. At this point, I think a single buy from someone like RC or daddy Elon could launch it high enough to begin a short squeeze. The volume is just too small for Melvin to prevent it. u/jn_ku has some fantastic analysis on this whole situation posted on investing (sit the fuck down WSB puritans, its good stuff).  I'd highly encourage each and every one of you to check it out, but the take away that I want to point to is his analysis on volatility. As total shares available and total shares being traded (read: volume) are lowered, buys and sells affect the price more. And fear not - we have whales who have yet to play their hand on our side. RC for example could scoop up a fuckton of shares any day, if he weren't worried about the SEC coming after him for market manipulation (ironic, huh? Fuck you right in the ass SEC).

Thirdly, Melvin and his 🌈🐻 gang can't just scoop up shares to cover their shorts after they ladder attack the price down. The whole point of a ladder attack is to artificially inject supply, to make people panic and sell, which will inject real supply, which they can then buy to cover their shorts. If people diamond hand, and no one sells, no matter how low the price gets, no real supply will ever be injected into the market and they'll never be able to cover. You see GME's price going down and down because Melvin and his cronies **exclusively** are selling. Nobody else. Melvin can't buy shares from themselves, and they buying shares from the people shorting and ladder attacking with them doesn't actually decrease the total amount of shorted shares at all, since they're buying a share to cover a short but taking a share that could cover a short at the same time. **No matter how fucking low the price gets, $100, $50, $1, they can't cover if you have the balls to 💎👐**. You may be asking, what if they buy calls and let the price recover after a short ladder attack to cover via exercising the calls without actually ever buying from market? Well, where the fuck do you think the sellers of those calls get those shares from? They have to buy from market too, which is just them passing the heaping pile of shit they're currently holding to the poor fucks who have to cover those calls. Either way, a short squeeze happens.

You're doing a good job at not interrupting me. I might let you hold my balls tonight while I fuck your wife silly.

**Q: Okay, so short ladder attacks are ineffective as long as nobody sells. But what if people are going to sell when it gets too low?! Aren't they scared like me?!**

I'd trust you 💎👐🦍 with my life right now. That's how retarded I am. But you're a little pussy bitch reading this because you need some pure, raw, uncut hopium. Its okay, at some point we all hit that alluring drug. Regardless of my level of trust for you retards however, why don't you go and see for yourself if people are buying? Go to whatever trading chart site you feel has enough crayons to satisfy your insatiable appetite and look at volume on dips and subsequent rallies. **Nobody is fucking selling**. **Not even on Thursday, when we experienced the most blatant market manipulation I've ever seen and a drop of over $300 in the span of just over 1 hour.** Really, go take a look. I've taught you how to look for when people are selling and when people are buying, and when its just a ladder attack via the volume. Don't take my word for it, go look for yourself. And try not to eat all the crayons on your way there. Or, at least, save the blueberry ones for me. Fuck, I love the blueberry flavor.

**Q: So if ladder attacks won't work no matter how low the price gets as long as us 🦍👐💎, then why is short interest being reported as less and less every day?**

First of all, I didn't give you permission to speak. But I'll let it pass because you've been a good retard and that's a good question.

You could attribute it all to media manipulation and fake news, and you may very well be right. We won't know until FINRA short interest is reported in just over a week. But who knows, there's a huge probability hedge funds will lie on their report to FINRA (after all, it is only a measly fine). So I propose we ignore all reports right now and instead look at the facts:

\- Hedge funds couldn't have covered with shares given the volume over the past week. Its mathematically impossible.

\- If hedge funds try to short ladder attack the price to obscenely low levels and you silverback 🦍🦍💎👐, then they'll try covering via large call option purchases - but again, this doesn't prevent a short squeeze, only pass the buck.

What else can they do? Well, not anything else to cover - but they can hide the true short interest through a whole fuckton of very illegal means. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean they're covering their shorts - it only means they're hiding their shorts.

Read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/) by u/DeeJay_Roomba. That's not a suggestion. It is seriously good DD backed by their sources.

Read it?

**A: Yes.**

Don't fucking lie to me. You just lost your ball holding privileges for tonight. Go read it, now.

They're fucking hiding in the grass. The punishment for all of this fraud and illegal manipulation is peanuts compared to the punishment of short squeeze, and this is how they're doing it. They haven't covered their short positions. The real short interest, which will be falsified on the FINRA report and is hidden by their scummy tactics, has been growing all along. Remember how, a week ago, some of you fucks were talking about how float short interest had risen above 140%? If the hedge funds are hiding their short positions this way - and keep in mind, again, there was no possible way for them to clear their short positions given your beautiful fucking 💎👐, so hidden short interest is the only logical explanation now - the short interest has risen. By a fucking lot. There's really no way to know the real number, but who knows? It could be 180%, it could be 240%, it could infinity%. One thing for sure though - short interest, if hidden in this manner, has gone up.

Yes, there are a few other ways of hiding short interest, and I'd love for people in the comments to explain it, but I'm too retarded to explain them myself. Forgive me DFV, for I've been naughty and haven't done enough illegal short hiding DD.

Any other questions?

**A: No daddy** u/ssauronn. **You've answered all my questions. I now know why short ladder attacks are entirely ineffective as long as people 💎👐, and I know us fellow retards have already proven we'll 💎👐 through drops nearing insanity, and I know how to check if retards are 💎👐. I also know why short sellers are trapped, utterly trapped, in their doggy position as long as we hold the fucking line. Thanks daddy. You can fuck my wife now. I'll just go play some minecraft until you're done.**

While teachers can struggle to make ends meet,  billionaires can go play golf on their ""lunch"" break and not worry about a dime. I really want to see this wealth transfer to the working class to see what they would do with it. Personally I would start up my own business. And I would hope many people would also take that opportunity. Just last week when the gains were going crazy, us redditors were going into our local communites and spreading the joy of giving. I believe that the more money the working class has access to, the better the economy. Soon, Walmart won't be owned by majority stakeholders and billionaires, no it will be the common people. (That's just a far fetched idea/example) But I hope you guys can understand what I'm trying to get at. 

ELI5: Imagine a world where cooperations aren't owned by big banks, but rather the common folk. This is how we start the movement, by holding GME to expose Wall Street and allow everyday retail investors the equal opportunity.

PLTR lock-up expiration and S-1 filing,44,laq0jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laq0jt/pltr_lockup_expiration_and_s1_filing/,23,1612278669.0,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.

Hey traders,

As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (estimated 2/11), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2/14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.

As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw [webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b](https://imgur.com/a/o5YePOB). Does this mean the lock-up expiration will free up only >400m shares (if yes, BULLISH)? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.

**NOTE**: This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so **PLEASE** correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.

As of **September 1st, 2020**, this was the total number of shares:

https://preview.redd.it/u1aprqkzc0f61.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9897b7685c69f1559e95a0061f0da300b0bdd40

Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options:

On first trading day back in September:

* 383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade
* Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade
* Due to Investors’ Rights Agreement, they ""expected"" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade
* Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float)

On lock-up expiration day (estimated 2/14):

* 1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade
   * From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares
   * Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares
* Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares.
   * The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares. The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.
* So the lock-up expiration doesn't free up **80%** of outstanding, but instead **42%**.

# Analysis on insider selling

As of **June 30, 2020**, this was how the shares were distributed:

https://preview.redd.it/0e3s44f780f61.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a24d4614b478a2e2ba5e9fe1264beebd54f8c

Source: [nasdaq insider activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/insider-activity)

All as of Feb 1, 2021, they sold the following shares:

**Executives and directors:**

* Alexander Karp: **10,244,631 shares**
* Stephen Cohen: **5,133,000** shares
* Shyam Sankar: **3,068,754** shares
* Alexander Moore: **303,000** shares
* Spencer Rascoff: **0** shares
* Alexandra Schiff: **0** shares
* Peter Thiel: **27,382,866** shares
* David Glazer: **2,261,507** shares
* Matthew Long: **848,811** shares
* Ryan Taylor: **1,075,892** shares
* TOTAL: **50,318,461** shares

None of the large shareholders/VCs/institutions sold! Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list! 🤣

The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances. But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity (something Robinhood doesn't have 🤡). Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out. (Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt).

&#x200B;

# What will happen on lockup expiration day?

I think the following will happen:

* 🧻👐 will sell
* Some short sellers will come by for sure
* Insiders will obviously sell some. But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that 🐻s are fearing.

**Some key rumors:**

* Some insiders are looking to buy up shares - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/)
* Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49dut/pltr_vs_child_rapists_starvation_hurricanes/) (a good DD overall as well from ex-Palantir engineer)

I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards. I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I think lock-up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish**

So you want to squeeze silver,0,laq09r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laq09r/so_you_want_to_squeeze_silver/,23,1612278635.0,"Over the last several days there has been a mania regarding the decades old strategy that large institutions have inflicted on the price of silver. Finally, the little guy has gained awareness and has a chance to expose and potentially beat them at their own game. As a full time retail trader focusing in the metal markets I am familiar with the “supply issues” and the suppression of price of silver. The idea that if the demand for physical silver rose and caused a scarcity and therefore a forced demand of deliverables could in turn seriously crush the larger institutions that are net short is not new to me. I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea that many degens in this and other forums have expressed in attempting to squeeze the gay bears through heavy call flow on SLV and AG. I was incredulous to begin with as we all know how easily the hedgies can change the game on us smaller fish.

In a Eureka moment it dawned on me that instead of trying to take down the entirety of the Silver Shorters, there could be more of an affect if you concentrated on one specific area. This is where SLV comes into play......stay tuned to the end as the plot thickens with even more manipulation at foot.

By now we have all heard of call buying gamma effects. Well, in SLV we have many key components that could cause the same effect that we saw in GME. The list is as follows:

* $25 dominant options strike
* The 25 strike relates to an area where major hedging by dealers needs to take place in order for them to  
stay solvent in their SLV positions.
* Hedge wall, where dealers are likely to change the way that they hedge, is currently sitting at $25
* The key gamma strike, where most of the open interest that is related to gamma, is tied to $25
* This indicates that at the $25 is where most of the dealer hedging needs to kick in.
* The key delta strike, where most of the ITM strikes are, is....you guessed it $25
* On top of these greeks, the top PUT OI and top CALL OI are at, yet again $25

We want to see the key gamma strike or hedge wall shift up high as this implies that dealers are buying at higher prices. Dealers are carrying a negative net gamma which means that they will get hurt as price moves up which causes them to buy more shares to keep up with their hedges. We currently have a much higher call volume than put volume as the 8/19/2021 EXP is 4.1 mil calls to 770k puts.

  
If SLV breaks under $25 you will see dealers begin to unwind there positions causing in influx of VOL. Moving forward (above $25) VOL is relatively low. This is due to the volume being distributed over a wide range of strikes. If there were to be a concentration of call buying at the $25 this will in turn increase the VOL above the $25 level.

  
If you want to see a Squeeze type move, we need to see an addition of call options at strikes >25 which would shift the momentum higher.

  
Here is where the plot thickens: As I was writing this I went to look at the AUG chain for SLV and noticed that it has disappeared across all platforms that I use. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY SCARED!!! Time will tell. The same effect could be accomplished by going one month out to the SEPT contracts or by buying shorter dated contracts and continuing to roll them until the dealers have drowned in that one position.

As with every disclaimer. This is not financial advice, and I wrote this as a research paper. Trade at your own risk and do your own research. Have fun and enjoy those tendies. 

My position: nothing currently, watching 25 carefully as I said.",2021-02-02 17:10:35

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it.",2021-02-02 17:05:58

With recent revelations of possible (if not likely) share counterfeiting, continued aggressive short ladder attacks, and increasing media distractions/disinfo, I have a theory I want WSB's input on.

# Short sellers are not just cheating at the game, they're scaring the referees into submission.

What we know:

1. Volume was incredibly low today, thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors (and good monkes holding).
2. Despite low volume, we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down.
3. Even with conservative/favorable estimates on short interest, HFs/MMs/Brokerages are still extremely exposed because...
4. There is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out, except continuously kicking the can down the road. As beautifully put by /u/forzan, [""their cure is a poison they can't stop taking.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/)

**This all points to textbook** [**Brinkmanship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmanship)**, or a form of** [**Madman Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory)**.**

GME shorts have taken the financial system hostage, strapped it into the back seat, and are driving full-speed-ahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken.  From what we've seen, hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet, to the point that it threatens to crash the market.

They know they lost the match, so their only option is to work the referees. My guess is that they're trying to fill the powder keg even more, and make the potential fallout so destructive, the SEC has no choice to step in and halt trading. Whatever fines or punishments are levied can't possibly be as bad as the alternative, which is an extinction event for multiple firms (HFs and brokerages).

# So how can the little  🐒 respond?

***You've got to convince them you're more irrational than they are.*** This shouldn't be difficult for this group of shit-throwing apes.

From the Wikipedia article on brinkmanship:

>*For brinkmanship to be effective, the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless credible—at some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.*

The hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the ""credibility"" of their threat as early as Wednesday last week. They're trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs don't cancel the match.

To win, retail investors have to show they're completely prepared to hold to $0.

The implications of this will be far reaching and, in the longrun, overwhelmingly positive.

   If you think about predatory short-selling and it's effects on the economy, it is a practice that removes value from the our economic system. Imagine all the new companies that, if given a legitimate chance to grow, may have produced huge value for the entire economy. Imagine if Melvin Capital had been successful with Tesla in that regard? The effects of putting off the EV revolution and our general move away from fossil fuels could have been disastrous. Not to mention the fact that the Cybertruck is gonna be cool as fuck and the world would be a bit sadder without it. The damage they have done already is incalculable.

My limited knowledge only lies in fundamental/long-term investing, so learning first-hand about how market manipulation can affect everyday people and not just HFTs (people I assumed are better off) made me mad. For these reasons and the fact that the lawsuits will take months, I feel that my itch for justice won’t be scratched unless someone tells me how this will never happen again. 

From my understanding, RH is fucked no matter what and the hedge fund managers are hopefully facing jail time. Great. However, I don’t understand what is going to be put in place to ensure this never happens again. People will just get replaced or get off virtually unscathed, so how will the government enact change to stop market manipulation? In my eyes, market manipulation is the main problem or is it something else...

Also, will trading become more positive for retail investors or will everything be the same (or worse) after this is over?

I just want to organize my thoughts and shape my views. Thx for any feedback.

Aussie trading platform Stake has restricted trading and I think that’s good news for us,81,lapp5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapp5f/aussie_trading_platform_stake_has_restricted/,54,1612277384.0,"So today Stake (the platform
I use) restricted trade on $GME $AMC and $NOK which got me thinking why they would do that? Every answer I could think of just reinforced the diamond hands mindset.

1. They don’t give a fuck about the small guy and their losses. Loss porn is literally a thing and that only proves that they aren’t protecting us, but their own positions. The only reason to protect yourself is if you are about to get hurt.

If someone is a about to punch you in the face but they are 2 blocks away you don’t do shit. If they are within striking distance you do everything you can to protect yourself.

2. The reputational costs of doing this are astronomical, take RH for example who possibly fucked their IPO. The cost/benefit of this means that these costs of removing shares is lower than the cost of doing nothing and getting smashed by us.

3. I could only think of two reasons before my autism kicked in and I started licking a pole. 

Not financial advice. Position .18 of a share. Poor AF.

Edit: from the few comments I can see, I’m not knocking Stake. I like their platform. I also know that it was not Stakes decision to stop trading as they made clear on their email.

GME Short Squeeze: What Comes Next,336,lapovy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapovy/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/,77,1612277355.0," 

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.",2021-02-02 16:49:15

Quit Trading on Margin: The Flip Side of Borrowed Shares,65,lapkqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapkqw/quit_trading_on_margin_the_flip_side_of_borrowed/,7,1612276873.0,"Hello fellow degenerates and gamblers,

I'm slightly stoned, kicked back a few beers. And being an average retard, cruising wallstreetbets, I stumbled upon Counterfeiting Stock 2.0. I'm also bad at Reddit, so have some mercy.

In [Counterfeiting Stock 2.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20210131132731/http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) is a passage about short selling:

* **Short Sale** — **Blah Blah, you can skip to the bold part** For example: If investor S wishes to  sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S  immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has  the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the  share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes  some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”,  which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and  investor L has his share back. This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. **The  investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left  his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level.** **If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a  short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner.** *If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they  are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the  account owner.*

Get out of margin accounts on all brokerages, and turn off options that have to do with stock 'borrowing'. Quit borrowing and lending your hard earned stocks. For instance, **my WeBull app has a 'Stock Lending Income Program' that I suspect is used for these purposes**. Express consent, as said in 2.0. I turned this option off, and the status went to 'Under Review'. Under review? No bro, i opted out, its not for review as far as I'm concerned.

Not all stocks are part of the income lending program on WeBull, and they give you pennies for the stock on lend, but this paranoid retail investor thinks this shit is all connected. FSM and Titan Pharma are the two companies I have held that are part of this program which provided me with a few pennies in return for holding the stock. Look at Titan's chart. With this knowledge in mind, their chart just looks like a wealth extraction scheme:

Look at the different programs you're a part of with your brokerage. I see all these fidelity posts out here, and maybe its time to be fancy myself and get a real brokerage.

TLDR; Dont trade on margin or use weird lending programs on apps. Maybe fancier brokerages don't have these sketchy programs.

- Aequitas (genitive aequitatis) is the Latin concept of justice, equality, conformity, symmetry, or fairness. It is the origin of the English word ""equity""

Finance and its subsequent regulation is borne from Law:

- The term ""equity"" describes this type of ownership in English because it was regulated through the system of equity law that developed in England during the Late Middle Ages to meet the growing demands of commercial activity.

One of the most interesting things about Equity Law is the Maxims of Equity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxims_of_equity

One of the most interesting things about these maxims are their applicability to the Market. 

One maxim is ""He who comes into equity must come with clean hands"":

- It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with clean hands (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek.[13] For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.

I wonder if taking a huge risk on naked calls with a bunch of boomer money is coming to the court with clean hands!!! LMAO

THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. YOU'RE A FUCKING MORON IF YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE A MOUTH BREATHER WHO LOOKED AT WIKIPEDIA 5 MINUTES AGO AND GETS OFF ON WORDS LIKE ""EQUITY"" AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A LIFE PAVED FOR HIM FROM HIS RICH DAD,  ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN AT SCHOOL BUT ENJOYED IT CAUSE #LATIN

Most simply, it’s a function of the riskiness of a security – being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks.

>As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise.

Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher.

For those wondering why BB QNX is so good,61,lapgwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapgwo/for_those_wondering_why_bb_qnx_is_so_good/,18,1612276433.0,"Information from Pixelcarve:

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can’t bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car – they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency – this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI’s to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it’s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform.",2021-02-02 16:33:53

I know 800 strike and the timeline is probably expensive. But if the dumbo hedgies try to ""scare"" us off with artificially low prices, we can respond by buying options contracts way out of the money, which inadvertently is probably not way out of the money at all. This could start a gamma squeeze and we can probably generate the catalyst we need to push back against the hedge funds.

Why AMC won't squeeze and other disappointing facts,0,lap4p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lap4p4/why_amc_wont_squeeze_and_other_disappointing_facts/,67,1612275116.0,"I'm just going to get straight into it because there are too much bullshit surrounding this stock already. AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.

\- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E)

And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**

[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)

&#x200B;

And **shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!** :

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602)

And more than **100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued**, they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise)

&#x200B;

**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** 

**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**

\----------

This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.

If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.

\---------

**TLDR:**

**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**

Poistions:

Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.

Diamond Hands Don't Mean Anything.,0,lap3an,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lap3an/diamond_hands_dont_mean_anything/,47,1612274965.0,"TL:DR Unless you control 100% of the float, this stock can be traded all the way back to $20, even if you ""Diamond Hands""?  Cramer alluded to it in his post about the number of shares traded awhile ago.  As long as shares continue to trade you can go to zero.  You can lock up 99% of float and still go to zero.

Let me explain it like I'm a 5yo.  Imagine a beaver damn on a river.  This beaver damn mostly lets all the water through.  It's been built in an area that can keep about 3ft of water in it, even during droughts.  Upstream is the 5ft river coming in and downstream is the 5 ft river of water going out.  So, it stays pretty stable.

Then imagine that there is a flash flood, and simultaneously, imagine that the beavers got really motivated.  The beavers decided to improve their beaver damn to the point that it would block 99% of the water flowing through it.  Super Beaver Technology Breakthrough.  This beaver damn never breaks, and it always blocks 99% of the flow.  It was built virtually overnight, and can be built as high as needed in order to stop everything except for 1% of the water to pass.

During this flash flood you have a stream of water coming from upstream.  Yet, they're met by this magical beaver damn that can increase faster than the waters can rise.  It includes OG ballers like DFV and Burry who don't want to sell right when the flood comes, as well as the index funds who can't sell.  Soon, you'll see the flood waters backing up to 20 ft, then 44, then 76, 159, 380, and even 483.  So, that damn keeps going higher, but it still lets 1% flow out.

Now picture the flood abating.  Instead of having a 300 ft wave coming down from the mountains, it decreases to 75, then 25, then back to 5.  That pool that the beavers declared to be unbreakable, will still stand.  But the pool of water, will always go back to 3, if the flood waters above decrease.

[$GME](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) 140,00€ ---- 169,12$

[$AMC](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/714132) 9,00€ ---- 10,87$

100€ = 120,8$

**How does pre market work in Germany?**

Our equivalent to Robinhood is called Traderepublic. All orders made through Traderepublic are traded through a private stock exchange called ""Lang & Schwarz"" (engl: long & black, lmao). Trading starts at 7:30am central european time (1:30am eastern time, 10:30pm pacific time).

**How relevant are these numbers for the US market?**

I don't really know. From what I noticed they don't mean alot but I know you guys are addicted to looking a 1 minute candles. Be aware that **volume is super low compared to US markets**.

Final Outcome Clarification,25,laozb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laozb1/final_outcome_clarification/,48,1612274546.0,"Hello Dysfunctional Tarzans,

Ok, so I can barely read as much as the next shit throwing monkey that roams these autistic lands and with that being said I was able to do a significant amount of DD in the form of reading every single WSB post in the past few weeks since this GME stuff really started to take off. So I am basically the smartest helmet. 

MY QUESTION : If over 100% of the GME shares where shorted by the Hedge Funds, and shorted shares being that they are borrowed and never actually paid for (yet) and then we have a bunch of retail investors that flood the market and pay cash for the GME shares so that we own the shares. This being the case, does that mean that every single retail investor has the opportunity to tell the Hedge Fund what price to pay for their share at? I mean if the Hedge Funds told the SEC that they own over 100% of the GME shares when retail investors actually own their shares. Then why are we not all of us setting our sell limit to 100k and no less. Forcing the Hedge Funds to pay that share price for every single GME share for every single investor that is selling.  

Like if I go on my account right now and set my sell limit to 100k right now, will the hedge fund eventually be absolutely 100% forced to pay that price no matter what? Like, they NEED my shares. The people who bought .5 shares of GME they don't just WANT  your half a share, they are in desperate NEED for that .5 share because they lied when they told the SEC how many shares they have so you could sell that half a share for 50k if you wanted to.

I know people have been saying that retail investors have the power right now. And is this how? Because we can set the price. Like an actual fixed price that they 100% have to pay no matter what.

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions

TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner


One paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link: (credit to u/bcRIPster)

“I don’t mean the bet WSB played… that Marvin had 140% of the FLOAT. I mean that Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock have sold more than the TOTAL SHARES that EXIST.

That's a completely different problem and it's punishable by jail time. Not a joke. It's basically counterfeiting stock shares, although that's not the terminology used. If this is true, who knows how many other times they’ve done this. Or maybe it's not true, and they just really like the stock??? If BlackRock started buying five days ago, and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days, then the doomsday clock doesn’t run out until at least February 17th. If Wall Street can get WSB to sell before then, then they won’t get caught and won’t go to jail. But if they don’t…. well, this will make Enron look like chump change.

If enough people hold until the end of February, and this is truly the situation, then there is a chance that major parts of Wall Street are going to IMPLODE.

---------- The Conclusion ----------

Apes need diamond hands until the end of February in order to get the SEC involved, most likely somewhere between Feb 17th - 19th. Whether or not this will happen is anybody's guess, but if it does all heck may break loose!”



My opinion? This, along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring March 19th that we’re just bought (see the front page of WSB) means that this may not end for a few weeks, maybe even longer. The only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are HELD.

Are we going to do this???? Or are we going to paper hand out? If we’re commuting to this shit let’s do it!!!! If you’re gonna paper hand eventually we don’t want you, get out. It just makes it worse the later you paper hand. Someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are.

TLDR:
If these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes, you may have to hold up until end of February or even longer. But this shit is happening. ALSO dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out. This is REALLY important. Take a walk, workout, read, watch TV, spend some time with family; take some breaks from staring at the ticker. It may not do much other than be manipulated lower, rise slightly, and be stable in the near term. But this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled

Stake suspending buys on GME AMC NOK,160,laoxn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoxn8/stake_suspending_buys_on_gme_amc_nok/,81,1612274404.0,"Forgive me for knowing less about this than my toaster does. Anyone here got a couple of brain cells to rub together and form a view?

From Stake:

We have just received notification, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, will not be able to offer Buys on GameStop ($GME), AMC Entertainment ($AMC) and Nokia ($NOK) due to increased capital requirements set by the DTC. 
Any buy orders on any of these symbols made after Monday’s close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open Tuesday.
To be clear, this is not a decision Stake has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the securities they make available. As such, we are unable to confirm when this may change.
If you’d like to understand more about the DTC and capital requirements, we’ve provided more information below.
When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. 
The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.
The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of the above symbols, the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.
DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase.  We’ll update you if this changes.
This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific.  It is calculated through a value at risk model (more detail on the formula is available from page 57 here). Most simply, it’s a function of the riskiness of a security – being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks. 
As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise. When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements. Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement.
All transactions are settled by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). Under normal circumstances, a DTC member is required to allocate a certain percentage of their balance sheet capital to settle such trades in advance with NSCC.
During last Thursday’s session, aggregate capital requirements rose from US$26b to US$33.5b across all brokerages. While DriveWealth was able to cater to new requirements, further increase has meant DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in $GME and $AMC (each stock has its own capital requirement rather a broker wide requirement).  Restricting access to certain stocks allows a brokerage to stay operational and ensure that all customers assets are protected.",2021-02-02 16:00:04

Lakeland Industries NASDAQ: LAKE,0,laoubf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoubf/lakeland_industries_nasdaq_lake/,20,1612274033.0,"Alright retards. Lakeland Industries. 10-15% short interest & constantly abused by wannabe hedge funds. 

It's a small cap manufacturer of protective equipment and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market worldwide. The company has a robust balance sheet, and current trades at a \~4x expected fiscal year ended 2021 EBITDA on a fully diluted basis (which is a complete joke).  The valuation is dumb for two reasons: 1) a general misunderstanding by the market that this is purely a COVID-19 play; 2) the company has traditionally been known as sleepy and a poor allocator of capital, which, contrary to its valuation, is no longer the case. 

Driven by a new management team and a newly implemented ERP system, the company’s recent financial performance has been outstanding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Q3 revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came in at $41.5M, representing growth of 18% from Q3, and 50% from the prior year’s Q3 of fiscal 2020. Increased demand for its products, and significant improvements in gross margins, Lakeland has enabled Lakeland to generate cash from operations of $34.5 million over the last twelve months. As a result of this success, the company’s balance sheet now features a total cash balance of $40.2 million, and no debt. Lakeland is one of the few producers of protective equipment to own its manufacturing facilities, which has enabled it to service customers globally far quicker than its larger competitors, who rely on contractors. An effective supply chain is an important differentiator in today’s environment. 

The capital structure is clean. Lakeland only has one class of shares, the total share count is fairly low, and directors and shareholders own roughly 2.9% of the company. Stock options outstanding also are very low (only about 24,900 as at October 31, 2020). The company does repurchase shares from time to time, but has not done so during the current fiscal year. 

Judging by the low trading multiples, the market has clearly branded this exclusively as a COVID-19 PPE stock. This appears to be far from the truth. Lakeland estimates that approximately 35% of its revenue is driven by COVID-19 PPE requirements, and the remainder of its revenue is related to product segments not related to the pandemic. Lakeland is therefore uniquely positioned to benefit not only from the newly emerging industrial cleaning industry, but also from the economic recovery. Management has been mindful to not pivot its core business entirely from protective equipment for various industries (O&G, fire safety, chemical) to servicing COVID-19 demand, so that it can continue to excel as the pandemic subsides. 

The big question for investors right now is what will Lakeland do with its glut of cash? The current management team is demonstrating a strong understanding of its cost structure, driven by its recent implementation of an ERP system.  Low margin SKUs have been culled, which has led to improved gross margins. The facilities in Vietnam and India are being expanded to meet the increased, and sustainable, demand in developing markets. On an annualized basis for the current fiscal year, Lakeland is currently clipping at a ROIC of 30%. Therefore I’m a proponent for reinvestment, and expect management to pursue scaling this business up. Complemented by a renewed societal focus on protective equipment, and buoyed by continuous PP&E stockpiling which is likely to sustain well into 2022, Lakeland is in a prime position to scale up its success and accelerate its already impressive growth trajectory. 

**Catalyst**

· Significant re-rate by the market once Lakeland sustains its impressive results as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A targeted EV/EBITDA multiple of \~13.0x is implied by comparable companies. That implies a TARGET PRICE OF $57, which will be easy to achieve and is backed by results.

The amount of volume trading has gone down from 130+ million to 20-40M yet the number of buys versus sells is still heavily skewed towards buys meanwhile hedge funds are manipulating the stock by making MASSIVE amounts of tiny calls and puts and buys and sells IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN AND TRICK ALGORITHMS into thinking there are massive sell offs when in reality everyone is buying and holding

DO NOT FALL FOR THESE SCARE TACTICS!!! 

The longer we buy and hold, the worse their short interest gets and the more this hurts them

PLEASE UNDERSTAND it costs YOU NOTHING TO HOLD, because YOU HAVENT LOST MONEY YET UNLESS YOU SELL (don’t)

ICLN is a long hold,18,laotg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laotg9/icln_is_a_long_hold/,32,1612273935.0,"ICLN is a strong hold under President BUYDEN

ICLN is an etf that holds a lot of green energy stocks - a lot of PLUG power as well. It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy. 

Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :

1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement
2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline
3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today’s dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.  
4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation’s governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. 
5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he’ll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that’s not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable – including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute – affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities – without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ. 
6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his [infrastructure legislation](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure) incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.  

All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.

But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.

Hedge funds have been doing this for a long time. Engineer a crash to get people to sell and give you what you want basically for free. It used to only cost a few 10s of millions to incite panic and crash something value. **Look up jim Cramer dirty hedge fund tactics.** Quick before it gets removed.

## Seems good monkey, MORE EVIL

They are even blowing millions hyping silver+(other shit), trying to get us so excited we sell GME at this deflated price to dive in the next big thing. They even said reddit frenzy (wsb) likes it. No one but bots even mentioned silver. Of course Citadel(loaned billions to GME shorting hedge fund, Melvin capital. Also owns Robinhood) is long on silver. They are trying to use the power of retail against itself.

### wat monkey to do?

I believe if, and only if enough retailers 💎🙌🏻 GME, sketchy hedge funds will have to close their positions (not just write an article saying they did). The counterfeit shares being used to by bears to drag down the price will dry up. The more money they spend driving down price artificially, the more violent they get squeezed out.

There is a reason massive numbers of out of the money puts are being sold. Real ones know. Don’t be caught without a chair when the music stops. A capital raise is in the works and you know what side is ‘in the know on this’. 

Only a matter of time before the company issues millions of new shares and they get dumped on everyone to pay down their debt.  Company has $1 billion of debt.

How does it pay its debt back? Sure as shit not with its current sales and revenue. It creates millions of new shares at X price and dumps them on the market and pockets the cash to use any way it sees fit.

Happens all the time. Stonks 101.

Now SI to realistic float ratio = 125-150% - VERY VERY HIGH!!!

KEY IS TO HOLDDDDDDDDD !!! DIAMOND HANDS!!!!

What everyone misses is that ENTIRE FLOAT IS NOT UP FOR GRAB, which is different from other stocks. You have RC Venture with 9m shares and out of 8 million diehards of Reddit wallstreetbets/gme groups, it’s easy to assume we have 15-20m shares among us in diamond hands! So realistic float of 21-26m is much more important than the textbook float of 50m. So that makes 31m of SI very high stacked against worst case realistic float of 26m!! Even if few people drop out (too bad they will miss huge gains potentials) then we are looking at 100% ratio at a minimum. Now imagine Ryan Cohen announces major news for GameStop like raising stake or huge tie up and stock jumps organically? Shorts are scared of that surprise. Porsche did exactly that with Volkswagen. Once short ladder attacks are over, low hanging fruits are grabbed up from paper hands and interest starts pounding on these HFs, the stock will jump exponentially!! 

Must read:
Feb01 COB article from a reputed writer on SeekingAlpha:

“The GME momentum higher will probably continue for some more days, even weeks. Some of the short-selling hedge funds will disappear - bankrupted or bought out (likely pennies on the dollar). When that happens, the GME rally/momentum will stop”

Great info on TWNK. I did not write this!! Just copied..,0,laolti,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laolti/great_info_on_twnk_i_did_not_write_this_just/,25,1612273135.0,"Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)

I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you’re looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***",2021-02-02 15:38:55
Why lithium is biggest Play in the coming next few weeks. $LAC Stonk can give you BIGGEST gains!,0,laokvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laokvp/why_lithium_is_biggest_play_in_the_coming_next/,45,1612273032.0,"Everyone in biden administration wants to be long on the Climate therefore lots of subsidies and hype is to go long on EV and solar. The biggest EV automaker is TESLA. Tesla is huge in demand, its factories is set up in Nevada. They all LITHIUM to power their cars up.

$LAC lithium americas corp just got approval from govt for lithium mining in Thacker Pass. Thacker pass has the most lithium deposit in USA and its located in nevada and its merely only 200 miles away from Tesla factories. $LAC already mining lithium in the Argentina and few other places so they are already know what they are doing and own thacker pass location in Nevada.

They are projected to start mining lithium in January 2022 and construction is almost complete as much as 60 percent. They are now signing. parnerships which are under NDA and I reckon one of the partnerships is TESLA and other big automakers such as GM, Ford, Toyota etc.

Currently we dont have biggest lithium miners in US, so in order to rise big in this revolution, US govt is helping $LAC and probabaly $LAC being the biggest lithium miner in US is a great thing for its economy and its automakers economy. Lithium americas currently raised 400 million dollars at average price of $22, currently its trading under that, so its a discount for you, but it wont stay longer. Once the partnerships are announced, it will rise big, now is the time to buy and hold.

Lithium is the new oil, This is easily can go 40s --> 50s --> 60 ---> after the launch easily can be trading may be even north of 100s. If your grandfather or dad missed on OIL investment, this is the best thing up and running now, so now is the time to give a second look. Check out $LAC.

**Math Time:** In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask ""is it possible $LAC could hit $40??????? ---> is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.

In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina (""CO"") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA (""TP"")

Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent (""LCE""). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum (""TPA""). Operating cost of $3.579/Ton. A 40 year project Life.

Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented. 3.1 Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.

Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton= 2.0 Billion revenue, $1.6 billion EBITDA.

As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $ 3.34 Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $19.18 billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of 5.91, SQM has 1.78 billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $14.87 billion Market cap, fetching a P/S 8.37. May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.

But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $4.8 billion , i.e $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion, i.e $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (8.37 x sales) we get $16.74 Billion i.e $167/share. And if Worldwide Demand for battery grade lithium Carbonate Rockets beyond supply as anyone paying attention predicts it will.....That friends, is when ""2 DA MOON"" starts to sound apt.",2021-02-02 15:37:12

BB - QNX Microkernel Cybersecurity Bull Case,176,laoj02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoj02/bb_qnx_microkernel_cybersecurity_bull_case/,44,1612272841.0,"Hello Friends,

TL;DR -  BB 🚀🚀Blackberry has an architecturally secure embedded operating system compared to competitors, safety and security are important for electric vehicles, military use, and future IoT devices, I am holding 2000 shares of blackberry and suggest you buy to hold for longterm gains.  🚀🚀

I'm a cybersecurity sector employee. I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of [Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/), [FireEye](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/) (check comments), and other cybersecurity vendors here in WSB. I have also written a [guide to understanding how propaganda and misinformation campaigns are being used to manipulate retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/) and what you can do to help yourself.

Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.

# What is RTOS

RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.

# Start with Monolithic OS

Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.

In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.

Good news is that they're more performant though!

# MicroKernel

QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.

This architecture is useful because it means that:

* Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.
* When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.
* Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.
* Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
* Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.

So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.

# Key QNX benefits

Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!

CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.

Safety & Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.

Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.

# Some other pieces

This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard)

This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service)

Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.

# Summary

Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.

Till now, we already knew this, but there's just one problem. If their decision to stop short selling leads to the consequent rise of the price, this means they can also decide when the price has to go up. Since the only reason why the price is down is cause of them, if they believe nobody is going to sell they can stop short selling and start buying thousands of calls and earn the money back thanks to our diamond hands...

The float is only 50.65M shares.

There's 8.1M WSB degenerates.

Let's throw out some scenarios to show how we (just the WSB degenerates), not even counting the rest of retail, could in fact own 100% of the float -

1. Every degenerate owns GME (yes I know that's not at all realistic) -50.65M / 8.1M = 6.33 shares/degenerate
2. If only 50% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .50(8.1M) = 12.51 shares/each
3. If only 25% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .25(8.1M) = 25.01 shares/each
4. If only 10% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .10(8.1M) = 62.53 shares/each

Let that sink in. Yes I know a lot of you have much more than than 62.53 shares, and a lot have only 1 or 2 shares (or even a fraction of a share).

This doesn't take into account all of the retail that is not even on WSB that owns GME.

This doesn't take into account all of the shares Cohen and others have bought up.

Bottom line, we, retail, degenerates, autists, & retards, likely own nearly ALL OF THE FLOAT.

Hedge funds bought up the rest, holding it to squeeze their fellow assholes along with us.

Why the S3 Short Interest Data May Be Accurate (But is answering the wrong question),60,laoc0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoc0e/why_the_s3_short_interest_data_may_be_accurate/,28,1612272126.0,"Disclaimer: Do not listen to me, not a financial professional, I can't tell if I'm paranoid and retarded or have some brain wrinkles anymore. This is not financial advice, blah blah blah, suck my dick SEC.

&#x200B;

Simply put, the S3 Short Interest data is probably fairly accurate. But it's not answering the relevant question.

&#x200B;

Anyone with any statistical background knows that asking the right question is as important as any analysis you do.

&#x200B;

For short interest there are two relevant questions:

1. What is the net exposure to a short in a hedge fund's portfolio?
2. How many shares still have yet to be bought that must be bought in order to cover?

&#x200B;

It is my belief that S3's data is answering the first question but not the second.

&#x200B;

Lately there has been a significant increase in volume for super OTM puts and super OTM calls. Selling a put is a bullish position and buying a call is a bullish position. However, the shares associated with these positions ARE NOT NECESSARILY PURCHASED YET. This is particularly true for selling a naked put.

&#x200B;

My thought is that hedge funds have begun selling a FUCK TON of otm naked puts. This creates some revenue for them and also, on paper, effectively closest their exposure to a short position. So, if you're short 100 shares and you sell a put (taking on the obligation to buy 100 shares at a certain, low, price, if the contract is exercised) you are effectively hedged. Thus as long as that contract is open, it may appear to S3's algorithms that the position is closed.

&#x200B;

The problem arises because those 100 shares linked to the sold put ARE NOT purchased yet if the hedge funds are selling naked puts. They are just floating about. So while the net exposure to short positions is reduced, the need to buy shares has not been alleviated.

&#x200B;

Perhaps the squeeze has been squoze. Perhaps not.

&#x200B;

I would appreciate any feedback that people have. I'm trying to determine for myself how plausible this is. Maybe I've got some brain wrinkles. Maybe I'm completely braindead. idk. lmk.",2021-02-02 15:22:06

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.  


it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)  


So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:  
400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8  
That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.  


Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:  
55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22  


That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-ap-martha-stewart-chronology-story.html

They failed to act on Bear Stearns. They failed to act on Bernie Madoff EVEN after they were tipped off.

Instead, it was Palantir's software that tipped off the SIPC.

https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/


The SEC is unlikely to act in favor of the retail investors because of one reason:

These employees have a good shot at retiring from the government to an executive position at these very hedgefunds. These current employees are incentivized to not act against the hedgefunds during their careers.

We should just replace the SEC with Palantir.

"Similar to what brokers claimed to be the problem last week, hedge funds closing their shorts will have an enormous liquidity problem too.",119,lanzkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanzkz/similar_to_what_brokers_claimed_to_be_the_problem/,80,1612270936.0,"TL;DR: there is only so much money hedge funds can cover their shorts, don’t be TOO greedy. 

Some people are calling for GME to hit 10,000 or 50,000 at some point. If GME hits 10,000 that’s 700 Billion dollars tied into the market cap (10,000 share price x 70 million shares). If it hits 50,000 that’s 3.5 trillion dollars (50,000 a share x 70 million shares). 

To be clear it seems that retail investors own 100% of GME, and some how hedge funds also own 130% of GME. So at 10,000-50,000 levels, retail investors would have between 300 billion- 1.2 trillion, and somehow hedge funds would have to cover between  400 billion - 2.3 trillion to close their shorts. 

These numbers do not compute with being able to be paid off by shorts covering, because hedge funds don’t have THAT much money. Both stimulus bills combined are just shy of the market cap of GME 50,000. 

Just saying be realistic on price guys. At GME 1,000 that’s 70 billion tied into the market cap, and that MIGHT be possible for the shorts to cover. Melvin capital is down 50% this year on what? A 15 billion dollar loss? Even if they lose ALL their money at GME 1,000 we still need to find 5 billion to short cover the rest. AND that’s only 100% of the float, they have apparently shorted 130%. Sure MAYBE they could cover at GME 2,500, beyond that there would be liquidity problems and bankruptcy filings.

Database for future accountability?,37,lanzj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanzj4/database_for_future_accountability/,7,1612270932.0,"We are seeing a media frenzy pushing a narrative that we know is separated from reality.

If there are sweeping legislative changes to market accessibility, if fees and requirements are hiked back up to pre-Robinhood days, if Mel Mel and the Hedge Boys start a socio-political insurrection to protect their wallets, whatever... It will get swept under the rug at the first available opportunity.

I suggest, given the absurd amount of misinformation being distributed en masse, that it may be in the best interest of the shareholders to have a compiled database of reference material consisting of the false narratives and their source, both for our own use as well as future necessity in the face of currently unforeseen backlash or subterfuge against we the shareholders, such as a smear campaign against WSB or Reddit, or a legislative censorship initiative, or SEC or other regulatory investigation, etc., etc., so that, rather than flail our arms and be labeled ""conspiracy nuts,"" we can provide a single link to a compilation of information that shows not only the list of lies that are being levered against us, but also those who spoke them.

I don't personally have the resources or knowledge to build a database, so if this remains merely my half-baked rambling and never comes to fruition, so be it. But if you do have such abilities or resources, perhaps this statement will be the driving factor which spurs you to action.

##INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The camera opens on my wife and her boyfriend sleeping on their Alaska King size bed, surrounded by a trio of greyhound dogs. Pan downward towards me, laying prone on the floor with my face illuminated in the glow of a decades-old Macbook. I stifle my giggles as I read a funny post by /u/brbcripwalking. He titled it “A Bear's Guide to Maruchan Ramen flavors.” My wife's boyfriend throws one of his 10,000 pillows at me.

##INT. BASEMENT – DAY 

My computer screen tells me today is Thursday January 28th. While munching on a raw packet of ramen, I scroll through a very very old DD post on GME by /u/deepfuckingvalue. Some of the words are big but some of the words are small too, so I think I get it. I decide to YOLO my wife's life-savings into GME with a market-buy order. My cost basis is $483 per share.

***

##EXT. BREADLINE – DAY 

I check my phone nervously. I do not look well. It is clear that I have been banished from the house for my indiscretion.

***

##EXT. UNDERNEATH A BRIDGE – THAT NIGHT 

I show the other homeless people my GME entry price and they immediately remove their own gloves and blankets to give to me.

***

##EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC – FRIDAY FEBRUARY 28th 2021, DURING MARKET HOURS

The streets have not been kind to me. I have murdered a Hot Nuts vendor and am using his cart to charge my phone. I check the GME stock price.



*The lighting in this scene is very important. You know the part in Pulp Fiction where they open the briefcase and their faces shine with the golden reflection? I wanna do that for this part, except it's a green candle on ETRADE beaming out of my phone to shine on my face.*




I cannot believe my eyes. My trade has turned profitable. I quickly paperhand. I am now a thousand-aire. I immediately order an Uber to Atlantic City to try to double my winnings at the blackjack table.

***

##INT. 2003 HONDA CIVIC – SAME DAY 

My Uber costs $368. I sit in the front seat. The Uber driver has a name but I forgot it. We have an intense discussion of GME's fundamentals and price movement in real time as he drives the 131 miles to Atlantic City. (This part takes up most of the movie).

***

##INT. HARD ROCK HOTEL & CASINO ATLANTIC CITY – THAT AFTERNOON

I sit at a blackjack table, surrounded by prostitutes. My Uber driver is also there. I am playing with my hand open. The Dealer deals me an Ace and a King.

:--|:--|--:
Dealer (to me):|Congrats. 21.|x

\~ 10,000 shares of GME and various options. I could have sold at $450 but I chose to hold. Now I have taken some profits along the way, but this represents a significant portion of my holdings still.

&#x200B;

I have no clue wtf is going on with all the media lies and BS and artificial suppression of buy side demand by RH and others - but remember the following

&#x200B;

1. Short squeeze is just ONE aspect of GME - there is a potential long term fundamental play as well. We are degenerate gamblers, but the ROOT of the GME thesis was ALWAYS A SOUND FUNDAMENTALS BASED THESIS
2. Ryan Cohen/Management turnaround plans, I think they are in a silent period prior to earnings. But I can imagine that this earnings call is going to be interesting. I hope they do some accounting voodoo and fuck over all these idiots who are calling GME a failing company.
3. If they can project strong e-com growth for 21/22 (20-50%+), and the market finally understands GME is going to be a gaming e-commerce powerhouse in the future, we may see a re-rating to Chewy-esque multiples. $20-30B valuation is not crazy in that case, current stock price doesn't sound too wild now does it?
4. If Ryan Cohen is truly able to transform the business, increase the TAM by adding new verticals like PC/E-Sports/Digital Platforms/Advertising - GME has a real chance at becoming a $50b company in 2-3 years.
5. Dont listen to the financial news - these are the same retards who thought GME was bankrupt last year. These are the same retards who think GME is a failing brick and mortar and that nobody buys games from physical stores anymore (despite GME doing $5 BILLION DOLLARS in revenue from their stores last year).

&#x200B;

TL;DR HOLD GME & BUY IF YOU CAN - whether for the squeeze, or for the long term potential of the company. The new may spin this as a gamble/speculation - but you don't see them pushing this narrative for retarded fucking obscene unrealistic speculative valuations like Snowflake and DoorDash do you? This is pure media manipulation and fuck Jim Cramer.",2021-02-02 14:42:03

Understanding Capitulation

By definition, capitulation means to surrender or give up. In financial circles, this term is used to indicate the point in time when investors have decided to give up on trying to recapture lost gains as a result of falling stock prices. Suppose a stock you own has dropped by 10%. There are two options that can be taken: you can wait it out and hope the stock begins to appreciate, or you can realize the loss by selling the stock. If the majority of investors decides to wait it out, then stock price will likely remain relatively stable. However, if the majority of investors decides to capitulate and give up on the stock, then there will be a sharp decline in its price. When this occurrence is significant across the entire market, it is known as market capitulation.

Innocent people with nothing to lose dont take the time or spend the money to create astroturf and floods of misinformation.......  This is a move for guilty as fuck people with a lot of skin in the game.  You think the shorts are out?  If they were, they would not give a shit about changing the narrative.

Here is why I think they picked silver:

1. It was already going up with gold, so they just had to point at it and say ""look!""

1.   its so fucking big $$$ wise that we cant effect it. So they arent giving us any control in their new narrative

1.    Silver is a total boomer thing, so its highly unlikely that any of us would have and shares to sell anyway.

1.    Its pretty victimless because its a commodity. If they had said the name of an individual company, it would have been much more targeted and would have caused more problems for them.

If I was on their marketing team, I couldnt have picked a better red haring

I got into this last week on damn good information.  Before the bullshit started.  We know that GME was 130% short halfway though January (NYSE Report).  We know that DFV is still in.  We know that someone out there with something to lose is throwing a small army of ""reporters"" market manipulators at us.

Most of all, I know that my worst loses have always come when I have folded out of fear.  I would rather ride this to the GME fair value of $150 then bitch out now and possibly miss my shot.

Edit per /u/Ostnic:  No.  We can not trust the data.  I would say even the NYSE report coming out on the 9th.  If these guys are willing to commit fraud and market manipulation, they will lie on a report.  That is assuming they dont have some  tool to fudge the numbers legally.  I cant tell you enough how easy it is to change a statistic to fit a narrative.  Dont believe anything is a fact unless you can personally verify it with your own eyes.

---------

Guess what you fucking idiot -- you aren't allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app. It takes more time.

---------

# There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.

They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.

The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses. [The reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the [failure-to-deliver numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/), and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.

We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely *is* out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.

---------

# That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.

**These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.** They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think *you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,* and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.

They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.

---------

# Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.

This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs. 

**The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen**, because *it's their job* to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.

DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization. **DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.** They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security. 

It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.

**Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.**

And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.

Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.

---------

# Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?

The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.

If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create *even more* synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once *those shares* are bought and held.

This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.

---------

**TL;DR**: 

WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.

**Strategy**: 

Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.

The Options Maker Exemption - The hedgie's dirtiest tool.,40,lanaps,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanaps/the_options_maker_exemption_the_hedgies_dirtiest/,4,1612268567.0,"There's been some solid discussion today regarding the tools that hedge funds, brokers and market makers use to fuck us over. I saw this post earlier: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/ that contained some euphoria about millions in way out of the money options were purchased this afternoon on GME. Well I'm here to tell you, this is how they make and sell shares that never existed to begin with.

Have a look at this link: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

It was posted in another thread earlier as well but I took some time to go through it. The most relevant tidbit I could find is here:

>A significant amount of counterfeiting is the result of the options market exemptions. The rule allows certain options contracts to serve as borrowed shares for short sales even though there is no company issued share behind the options contract. The loophole is easily abused, helped in part by SEC's apparent inability to globally monitor compliance. There has been considerable pressure on the SEC to close the Options Maker Exemption, but through January 2008, they have refused to act.

In a nutshell, the ""Options Maker Exemption"" is a tool that market makers can use to ""hedge"" their positions should the underlying stock go against them.

They start by issuing naked options contracts, today that consisted of several thousand naked calls at $800 strike. Once those options are sold, the fund that buys them now has the ""rights"" to millions of shares and, thus, can sell them on the open market without ever exercising those calls. If they have enough shares they can effectively suppress the price of the underlying and buy back the shares that they sold. If the price doesn't stay below their sale price they have 3 days to supply them or the shares fail to deliver and go into an SEC report. All along, the options they purchased are assumed to be and will, in all likelihood, expire worthless which is part of the plan.

The shares that they ""borrow"" by doing this don't ever hit the short interest volume and you never see it reported. The books are kept hidden and when the strategy works nobody is the wiser and it's used a lot more than you think. The failure to deliver report If the strategy doesn't work, the failure to deliver report will show it but the SEC doesn't actually seem to investigate or prosecute this fraud. Here's the most recent report up to Jan 14th: https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm There are millions of shares that have failed to deliver across hundreds of equities because of strategies like these and the SEC does nothing.

This report is showing 621,483 shares of GME failed to deliver on Jan 14th. These are shares that people like you and I have paid for that don't actually exist. I have no doubt this number is in the millions by now. Contact your local representative!!!",2021-02-02 14:22:47

They began launching the ""McPlant"" in Denmark and Sweden this month.

A friend of mine discovered the ingredients list of the McPant, Mcdonalds big new plant based burger. He cross examained it agianst the BYND meat burger, note...Mcdonalds and BYND have yet to anounce any partnerships on their McPlant Burger. After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever ""Meatless Meat Comparison Chart"" or MMCC.

As you can see from the results, he found that there is a 87.5% match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger. This essentially means there's a partnership with McDonalds and Beyond which is yet to be announced or discovered. The proposed theory is Beyond Meat will be supplying all of the McPlant Burgers in a massive deal.

Changing the rules: creating loopholes for GME short position holders?,29,lan492,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lan492/changing_the_rules_creating_loopholes_for_gme/,47,1612267959.0,"I've been noodling on how an institutional trader who opened a short position on GME at $20 (or less) might wriggle out.

In my experience, when Big Money gets into trouble like this, they print money (QE), ""restructure,"" issue bailouts, and, generally speaking, CHANGE THE RULES.

Some things I've seen in the past are:

1. DILUTION. GME could issue a new block of shares; like 50,000,000 of them. This would dramatically drop the prices, as the Supply of shares available significantly increased, IF Demand remains (about)  the same. I suppose this could come from their treasury of shares; or, one of the investment banks could underwrite more?
2. BAILOUT. Could Uncle Jerome step in and cut The Boys a big fat check for the money they lost? Dress it up as some form of Quantitative Easing?
3. DEBT RESTRUCTURING/BANKRUPTCY. Create a new fund specifically for the purpose of assuming the debt and declaring bankruptcy. What happens to the debt in this case?
4. UPSTAIRS TRADING. Can a US Equity short be covered in the OTC markets? Like, could a short sale holder cover by buying directly from Gamestop at, say $25/share? Forgive my ignorance, but is there any way to cover a short BELOW the market price, maybe in a dark pool, or do NBBO rules prevent this in the U.S. Equity markets?

There’s also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips. 
Cars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one.

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29T04V

I came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. 

https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM

Now, I couldn’t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: 
Market Cap- 571 billion
2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). 
Earnings- 530billion.  

This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. 

Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.
Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E

So shouldn’t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? 

I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. 

Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. 

Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA

Why eBay is going to roll on their earnings,37,lamy9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamy9l/why_ebay_is_going_to_roll_on_their_earnings/,51,1612267414.0,"By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.


Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. 


TLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",2021-02-02 14:03:34

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and you’ll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren’t already excited, maybe you’ll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you haven’t found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can’t tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, don’t you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

If your interest is perking, you’ll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse [promised(listen to question and answer section)](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023.

I'm as much of a smooth brain as the rest of you if not more but if i'm reading this right doesn't this mean they want to increase the share capital by NIS1.25b (to NIS2.5b) so that the total float of the company will be 500m which NNDM values at 5NIS per share?

However they are given 2 trading days to do that (Wednesday). Ever thought that the reason Monday and Possibly Tuesday will be red is actually the big companies forcing with all their power to lower the price and exit with minimal loss when Wednesday comes? And then when they close out the Short Float being EXTEMELY LOW will cause the stock to rocket up again.... Think about it...,2021-02-02 13:53:45

Why I think Robinhood's 'clearing house issues' are bullshit,121,lamltp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamltp/why_i_think_robinhoods_clearing_house_issues_are/,44,1612266298.0,"I have been reading through SEC regulations for an hour and finally found something useful pertaining to this debate I've been having regarding an article who strangely gave no sources but says that brokers have to supply funding to the clearing houses for security purchases and can't use client money. This obviously could cause a liquidity issue for a smaller broker like Robinhood last week but they denied any such issues. 

Even so, I found that the SEC states ""......we believe that, at a minimum, this means that the introducing broker-dealer must: (1) be financially responsible to the clearing broker-dealer for all customer trades until the clearing broker-dealer has received payment (or securities), i.e., the introducing broker-dealer must be at risk to the clearing broker-dealer for its customers’ failure to pay""

This says to me that if Robinhood has our funds from our bank and they have cleared (meaning isn't using margin from an instant deposit), they are at no risk of our ""failure to pay"" and can use that money without violating this guildeline. They fucked us hard and that's all there is to it.


If anyone has a source that credibly says otherwise on this subject I would very much like to see it.

Here's the source, pg. 22 https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/34-52635.pdf


Edit 1: someone mentioned before their comment was removed that it's not SEC regulation but DTCC policy changes that cause this so my reponse was ""Oh ok, I misunderstood and thought they were referring to SEC regulations. That makes sense now though. The underlying problem is then that the DTCC is essentially a monopoly and can control the market with mere changes in policy, right?"" Cause why TF would they care whos money it was if they were really just trying to make profit off of clearing.",2021-02-02 13:44:58

$BB DD - NO MEEMS - PART 2,328,lamill,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/,75,1612265998.0,"TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.

Imagine you’re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don’t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into John’s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that’s fun but usually it’s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen’s account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldn’t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas….Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let’s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you’re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you’re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don’t think they need, and last time I checked $BB’s CFO wasn’t completely retarded. Now, it’s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they’re growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isn’t a perfect comp (I’ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a “baseline growthy” tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID “$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG”, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU’D BE RIGHT!!

“But wait,” you say. “growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn’t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.” Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

“Hah,” you say smugly. “Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks”.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I’d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chen’s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained – Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2 – BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let’s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let’s look at two two non-retard quotes –

***""I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."" Steve Jobs***

***“If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB’s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0

Even as a $BB bull, I didn’t expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3 – BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A “START-UP”. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY’S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

"$BB DD, NO MEEMS - PART 1",354,lamg0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/,62,1612265755.0,"Dear WSB - While I hold nothing aginst $GME, $AMC etc. - and imma let you finish - but $BB is one of the most solid fundamental, growth plays in the entire stock market, let alone the current trending meme names.

Forget about squozes and voodoo ass candlesticks. *#Ben Graham gang #*. There was a great post re: the company's product line up [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/), make sure to check that out if you haven’t already.

My approach is to look at $BB from a ***strategic*** financial lens. First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp. w/ a company like BB where one-time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady-state earnings. So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings. Basically – How does the market value similar businesses? ?

No shit BB is not a phone company anymore. They are, if you’ve been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company. What is endpoint protection? Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT – Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.

Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges. So what does this mean? It means we can take a look at ***other endpoint protection / digital security*** companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.

See below a quick spread. Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of **at least** **$60 / share.** And this is only if it is the average of its peers. I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.

https://preview.redd.it/4q73p1tjize61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=863fed2b3532f8b371a88ecb7fc438cd52fe0216

Long story short – Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth. **IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY - A FUTURE-FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS (E.G. MOBILITY / TRANSPORT), ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE “COMPARABLES” ARE TRADING.**

In other words, ***the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit*** (lack of public understanding of its current business). ***In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit***. John Chen (look up his resume), is a world class operator, and frankly almost too low key for his own good. Personally as an Asian, I sympathize – sometimes the community focuses too much on keeping their heads down to work hard, and less than they should on messaging! Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!

No matter how good (or bad) the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon. So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks. You also saw the post on [reflexivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/) (basically, stonks up can make company good, not just company good make stonks up).

The best part is - **even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop. Imagine -** **Base case of going into orbit, with extreme upside of potential based on what's going on in the markets right now. FOr those of you non-retards, that's called** **POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE**\*\*.\*\* **YOu don't have to try to ""time the top"" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals / non-technical reasons supporting the stock.** ***There's a reason John Chen took his bonuses entirely in stock the last few years.***

**TLDR: $BB = Buy Blackberry.**

**Recap:** The month started off very well. PLTR, FCEL, and ACB all performed excellently. Then I got greedy, and made a huge mistake. I tried to catch the falling knife QS, enticed by the insane premium. It tanked 5-8% nearly every day after. I did my best to reduce the cost basis using covered calls, from $65 all the way down to $51.50, but the stock simply continued to drop. I was forced to cut my losses, and was on the verge of giving the challenge up entirely, but GME came to the rescue and saved the portfolio. I sold the shares too early, but was just happy to break even for the month. But the real icing on the cake was a large bet on SLV at the end of the month which netted a whopping 3k profit, closed today. I didn't like the price action I was seeing on GME today so I dumped it at 250 and will not be reentering the position again. (RIP bagholders?)

# February Trades

With the incredible performance of my risky January trades, I can afford to play things more conservative from here on out. No more taking risky bets on dangerous stocks like QS. I will continue to focus mostly on theta gang, wheeling and selling cash-secured puts on high-IV stocks that I am generally bullish on. I may return to PLTR if the price drops a bit from its current highs. Also taking a look at shorted stocks like BBBY if they continue to discount in price.

Beyond that, I'm getting a bearish vibe from the market, and I'm ready to switch gears. Any leftover cash I have after using the bulk of my collateral on CSPs, I may just dump into bearish option bets, such as VXX calls, SPY puts, SLV calls, and the like. This will only be a small portion of my total holdings, however, and I will have to follow the price action carefully before placing such bets.

Will update tomorrow morning with my first February trades. Also, at the current rate I will easily break 100% ROI by year end. I may just have to set a more ambitious goal, perhaps 200% ROI? We will see...

***An Open Letter to Wall Street***

***(by a retail investor):***

*Retail  investors across the globe get the short end of the stick. Period. This  is not just a fact, but an unwritten law of financial markets. A law  not just in the figurative sense, but in the real sense that it is* ***enforced*** *day  after day on every piece of legislation, on every contract, on every  brokerage, on every clearing house, on every exchange, on every market.  Markets are built on this assumption and thrive on making sure that the  retail investor ends up poorer or at most.... just making enough to have  him think that he is actually rich.*

*At  first it was told to us that this was because retail investors simply  could not understand financial markets. It was too complex of a subject  for the average citizen, therefore only the pros could succeed at it. So  they put retail investors on passive funds, bonds and whatever else was  simple and predictable enough that the pros could leverage their  ""sophistication"" and profit from that predictability. To this day the  narrative that retail investors are dumb and need to be protected is  propagated.*

*Then came 2008 and it  was revealed that the average ""unsophisticated"" investor was screwed  out of his retirement fund because the ""sophisticated"" guys and gals at  Wall Street got carried away in the ecstasy of seeing numbers get bigger  on their ""sophisticated risk models"".*

*Trying to confine retail investors to the ""kids playground"" of the market has not been working well. We have* ***great***  *security analysts among us, not just Mr. K.G. (*u/DeepFuckingValue*) but  countless others that have proven to have what it takes to do proper  in-depth, timely and actionable research that led to legitimate, legal  and impressive gains. We also have had a great deal of bad DD, bad  trades and eye rolling losses posted on* r/wallstreetbets. And my point  here is that ***it is ok.*** *We own it, warts and all.*

*We are not a company, not a hedge fund, not a single entity. But* ***we are*** *a community of like minded individuals,* ***and here I am referring to all retail investors***  *of which* r/wallstreetbets *is just a subset of. And this community is  showing that it can play on the same level as any sophisticated trading  firm in Wall Street* ***if it is allowed to.***

*We,  the retail investors of the world are aiming for a revolution in  financial markets. A revolution in transparency and an equalization of  opportunities. We are* ***tired*** *of the gatekeeping. Wall Street has  Bloomberg Terminals, High-Frequency algorithms in a building next to the  NYSE in order save nanoseconds in latency, the whole fucking rest of the  finance world to share information with and let's not forget their  buddies in the media that will happily oblige to give them air time to  ""expose their highly informed thesis"" to the masses in a sick play  resembling a cat toying with its food before devouring it. And on our  side what do we have? We have one (albeit genius) security analyst with  sick spreadsheet game sharing his insight on a platform that allows us  to democratically select what topics and ideas we value more. Then what  do we have? We've got numbers and we have heart. We have people for whom  that $30K gain is life changing, we have people that as soon as they  make some money they make a point of helping their fellow humans out  even if later on they go on to lose it all, they did their good part  while they could. Did you notice the disproportionately low amount of  ostentatious frivolous spending posts against posts of people that  actually did something good with their gains on* r/wallstreetbets?

r/wallstreetbets *is trying to save capitalism from itself, and capitalists are failing to recognize it.*

*Together  we have the capital to rival Wall Street on a play like GameStop, but  then they go around outside the market to try to split our firepower  into other less promising plays. They employ what for them is a little  capital but for us would be a massive hit in misinformation campaigns,  bots and paid actors to dissuade us from the conviction that we are  right and they are wrong.* ***They sabotage citizens of their own country and of the entire world in a deliberate effort to impoverish them.*** *Indeed  we do not have that on our side. Thank God we don't. We have numbers,  heart and a knack for seeing something good when it presents itself.  Wall Street could not handle us in a leveled fight and they know it.*

*Let  this message be heard by the entire world. We are tired of fighting for  the scraps and being told anything we make of it is by dumb luck. Open  the fucking gates and let's see if we cannot distribute wealth for real  using the very market that was once designed to concentrate it.*

IFF - Updated Due Diligence And Potential HUGE Upside,0,lam364,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lam364/iff_updated_due_diligence_and_potential_huge/,22,1612264588.0,"Hey you guys! - Sloth

Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF. 

TLDR: Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze; Gamma squeeze at $150; and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.

Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume. Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder (started at 2:50pm). There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.

The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now. 

And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open. Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.

Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150.

So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares. I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though. 

This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150.

Yes,of course I have positions on IFF. And no, this isn't investment advice, just a recommendation to check it out yourself.",2021-02-02 13:16:28

ETNs too good to be true?,0,lam2s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lam2s2/etns_too_good_to_be_true/,15,1612264553.0,"I've been a long-time leveraged ETF investor (with typically \~30% of my portfolio) but the effects of beta-slippage and occasional poor tracking of the underlying index have always been difficult to factor in when making investing decisions. It's fairly hard to forecast medium-term and long-term volatility and how that might impact portfolio performance.

I have been researching ETNs and so far they seem an excellent (maybe better?) alternative to hold vs. leveraged ETFs for the following reasons:

1. No short term capital gains tax 
2. Far better tracking of the underlying index
3. Don't have to worry about beta slippage 
4. Slightly lower expense ratio
5. The risk of a bank/lender defaulting seems (to me) extremely low unless we have a repeat of 2008 and the bank collapses...this would obviously have severe implications on the market no matter what stocks you're holding

Can someone poke holes in the logic above?

AMC Short Interest is Actually 10-15% After Recent Equity Issuances - Efforts Should be Focused on GME!!!,219,lalzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalzbt/amc_short_interest_is_actually_1015_after_recent/,148,1612264235.0,"**TL;DR: people are over-estimating AMC potential, true AMC short interest is 10-15% after a large number of recent equity issuances... FOCUS ON GME**

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q3’20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they’ve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))
2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented 44.2mm new Class A shares hitting the market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E))
3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).
4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market ([http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf))

**Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:**

1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf), page 1 and page S-18
2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.

**Edit 2:**

I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:

We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.

**Yahoo Finance** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): In Footnote 5, they state Shares Outstanding (and then I ASSUME Float as well) is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their 287.28mm shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.

**Market Watch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): I can't figure out how they calculate 56.57mm public float, but their shares outstanding are the same 287.28mm as my #1. So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe my more conservative shares outstanding calculation of 331.7mm (point #5 instead of #6 to be conservative), that's an extra 44.4mm shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of 56.57mm shares, equals 100.97mm shares in the float and thus 44.3% short interest, which is significantly lower than the 79.0% they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to 56.57mm.",2021-02-02 13:10:35

Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.    


There are 8 million people in this sub now.  Imagine if each one of us sent a complain to the SEC.  How on earth could they ignore us?  My opinion is that we have not done enough campaigning of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.  

We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,48807,lalucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/,2395,1612263785.0,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

Fundamental analysis of GME and an argument for why the speculation is perfectly reasonable,165,laltl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laltl1/fundamental_analysis_of_gme_and_an_argument_for/,34,1612263716.0,"Hello to all you **special**, *fabulous*, and unsophisticated retail traders. I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are ***ACTUALLY*** ***PERFECT*** for company beginning to restructure and transform.

* Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare [Gamestop](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm) and [Best Buy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/764478/000076447820000062/bby-20201031x10q.htm) fundamentals using their October 2020 10-Qs. BBY is much bigger than GME, isn't currently losing money, and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt, so how do their fundamentals compare? They both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020, and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios (.5 and 1.0). Their current distribution of their current assets is similar, but one huge positive for GME is that their current assets are 37.5% cash and about 50% inventory, which is great for companies beginning to restructure. A large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies, inventory obviously/hopefully means future revenue for retailers, and a conservative net AR balance in 2020 is likely for the best (not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected). The majority of the current liabilities for GME are AP and accrued expenses, which is standard for commercial retail companies. However, it's more important to note relatively low levels of actual ***current*** debt, ***long term*** debt, and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid. [ASC 842](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/leases-what-investors-need-to-know) changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with ***some relative*** ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room.
* Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss  and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So while it's definitely not ideal to see they losses, they made significant progress towards having a positive net income ***IN A PANDEMIC/RECESSION***, and this was still before the PS5 or Xbox Series X was released in November. GME had a positive total cash flow, but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment. Sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies (think of a McDonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow) but I believe it will be [good for them](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/making-stores-matter-in-a-multichannel-world#).  This is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer, which I believe will ultimately make them profitable again. If you don't believe me, you can read exactly what their plan is.
* Ryan Cohen and other Chewy executives [did not invest and join the Gamestonk board](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-adds-chewy-ryan-cohen-wall-street-darling-to-board-2021-1) for the lulz. They liked GMEs plan and the unique opportunity that Gamestop presents, kind of like all of us shitheads here. I think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve e-commerce sales. The business strategy from their October 2020 10-Q:

>**BUSINESS STRATEGY**  
>  
>In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets.  
>  
>***Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 461 stores year-to-date in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $315.9 reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs year-to-date in fiscal 2020.  
>  
>***Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.*** Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital first omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch and customer experience enhancements within GameStop.com, the launch of a completely new GameStop App, as well as the optimization of our retail store footprint to maximize our customer reach more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, however, wherever and whenever they want to shop. Enhancements to the user shopping experience and improved omni-channel capabilities, including expanded delivery and payment options, yielded an increase in e-commerce sales of over 430% through the third fiscal quarter of 2020.  
>  
>***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop’s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.  
>  
>***Transform vendor partnerships.*** Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams through an expanded suite of product and service offerings to optimize the lifetime value of every customer.  
>  
>Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See ""Consolidated Results from Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses"" for further information.  
>  
>We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and realize on our transformation initiatives. Key areas of investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omni-channel retail platform.

* I still think shorts did not cover, red days are meaningless short ladders, there's probably counterfeit shares floating around, and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze. But ***totally forgetting*** all that for a second, when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price? A ton of startups and tech companies that IPO trade wildly higher than their fundamentals. A big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership, look at Elon and renewable energy or Portnoy and mobile sports betting. Why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity, great executive leadership, and [in an emerging industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/#dossierSummary__chapter2) any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that aren't profitable? What's the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company IPOing?
* Based on all of my fundamental analysis, I feel comfortable setting a price target and sell limit of $69,420.69, cause stonk. I'm so behind on my work from today because I can't stop thinking about gamestonk and watching the price and volume on Think or Swim. Diamond hands forever but I need a break for a few days.

Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's ""failure to deliver list"" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

SEC Site - [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $2.05

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

I'm definitely hanging on to my 1 GME and praying that bitch shoots to the moon

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019.

Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal)

The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

TLDR: I think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their GME shorts till March 2021. Ask yourself if you're willing to hold and outlast them. If the answer to that is yes, you can do something truly impactful here that ONLY GME can make happen. If the answer is no, then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners, some people will go home losers, and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because that's what they do.

Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal. 

I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3/19 $800 call options and the significant volume. I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what *might* be going on. Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed. 

Let's start with the numbers...there were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations. This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest (for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday). Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or decreases...this will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them *have to be opening* *new contracts* since the volume is 3x the OI. Proof below.

Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations? There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and/or most reasonable explanation. My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO. If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is \~$57M...also note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so. They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate. Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?

I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these naked...could they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME? Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks. It also exposes the seller to *massive* risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM. It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the money...we know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.

I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.

If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why? Well...\~$57M isn't *that* much when you're down billions so far on your shorts. If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery,  and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2 *very important* things could be achieved: 1.) They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and 2.) they can recognize significant profit/hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up. 

The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors (Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media) to get their ducks in a row. They are trying to engineer the squeeze *on their terms* to reduce their losses. 

TLDR: There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes. Seems weird for them to be sold. Might be HF's plan to profit/hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.

We all know this is a whoever blinks, loses, game. That is why diamond hands has become so important, but we cannot just wait even though the other side is bleeding out. We need to end this with some decisiveness, otherwise we risk losing in a rigged game. 

We have to get the SEC to investigate the short ladder attacks. We have to find a better way to expose what is going on. We have to do something.

Look at the same stats on Yahoo Finance for any other company. I can't find any company with anything remotely close to this number. They're (obviously) not over 100%, because HOW CAN IT BE?

It's insane to me that media outlets are saying hedge funds are closing out positions and are all on key. No big conspiracy, nothing to see here.

If something as simple as % ownership by institutions has these insane monkeyballs numbers, what else is going on really? Something smells VERY wrong here.

This house of cards can't stand up. These guys must be scared shitless because all the shit I've seen, every stat, every report, every DD it all leads back to one inevitable truth: THESE FUNDS NEED NEED NEED SHARES to cover up whatever it is they're trying to hide.

*Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement*.  Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have **reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed** so that it can be delivered on  the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any  equity security.[\[7\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) **This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.**

**Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8)to  take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out     requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of  like    kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to   deliver   for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of   regular   trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement   date,   referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver   that the   participant can demonstrate on its books and records  resulted  from a   long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure  to deliver by  no   later than the beginning of regular trading hours on  the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date,  referred to as    T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or  dealer and any    broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for  example, an    introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9)**may  not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing    or  entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known  as    the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer  purchases    shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and  settles**.   In  addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that    participants  of a registered clearing agency must immediately   purchase  shares to  close out failures to deliver in securities with   large and  persistent  failures to deliver, **referred to as “threshold securities,”** if the  failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) **Threshold securities are equity securities**[**\[11\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11)**that  have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive     settlement days** at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National     Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); **totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.**    As  provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are     included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization     (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a     participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13     consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a     registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a     registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive     settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule     203(b)(3) remains in effect.

# So, is GME a ""threshold security"" as defined by the SEC here:

* Outstanding Shares of GME:     \~ 69,750,000
* 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares = \~300,000
* ""aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days"" = 2,351,180
* Is 2.3 million > 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares **AND** is 2.3 million > 10,000 shares?

&#x200B;

# IN CONCLUSION, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%, or any of the other fucking days!!!!
2. No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float as reported from December, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock
3. They should have already executed the failed to deliver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares

$FUBO DD - This stock could moon,30,lalgc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalgc9/fubo_dd_this_stock_could_moon/,65,1612262511.0,"***Please Note:*** *This is for those of you who are not all-in on GME and like to look at alternatives. Not saying sell GME to buy FUBO, just saying there are other interesting alternatives out there, and FUBO is one of them. Also, it's heavily shorted.*

* **FuboTV, ticker FUBO**
* **IV:** Around 200% this morning on puts expiring Feb-12th
* **FUBO earnings date:** Estimated to be Feb 5th
* **Share Float:** 52.06M (as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
* **Short % of Float:** 72.74% (as of Jan 15th, as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
   * I mention this because FUBO was heavily shorted when the stock rose in the $60’s, and unfortunately shorters succeeded in crashing the price.
* **Market Cap:** $2.85 B

**My position**

* 38 shares @ approx. $31
* 100 shares @ approx $43 bought this morning, and sold a covered call at $55 strike for $6.10 for Feb-12th. I'm sure I'll regret it, but the yield on both the call itself, and the potential yield if I get called away for downright phenomenal, hard to turn down.

&#x200B;

**- The DD -**

**What is FuboTV?**

Mama Wood said it herself (paraphrasing here): Cable is dying, to hell with cable, we want MOAR STREAMING!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, cable and television plans are dying. Nowadays you have a ton of flexible solutions, from the obvious Netflix and YouTube, to Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Hulu, etc. FUBO is capitalizing on this trend for sports fans. It is the country's first sports-first service. While the price might seem steep, it gives you access to dozens of regional, national and international sports channels, including live events in 4K HDR.

Beyond sports, it offers much more; 112 channels in total, including 43 of the top 50 Nielson-rated networks (for you autists and retards out there, Nielson is an American information, data and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries and employing 44,000 people (says Wikipedia, I’m too retarded to do more research on them). Sample non-sports related channels on FUBO include: A&E, Adult Swim, AMC, BBC America, Bravo, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc. Yes, they even have the Weather Network.

**Recent acquisitions:**

No DD of a hyper fast growing company would be complete without discussing acquisitions.

* **Vigtory:** The company is in the process of acquiring and integrating Vigtory Inc to the platform. Vigtory is a sportsbook (sports betting). It will also remain available to those not using FuboTV (aka: additional revenues, but also additional marketing for FuboTV)
* **Balto:** Balto develops tools for users to organize and play fantasy sports games, and FuboTV intends to combine its technology with Balto to launch a free-to-play gaming offering.

**Some numbers (yes, the quant stuff):**

Average revenue per user (ARPU) has gone from $37.93 per month in 2019, to $53.73 in 2019, and to $67.70 in the latest quarter. In contrast, it’s average monthly cost per user has risen from $40.59 in 2018 to $56.78 in the last quarter. Yes, they were obviously operating at a loss, and yes they are now operating at a positive contribution profit. As of the latest quarter, they had 455,000 paid subcribers. Grand news, yes?

**Q3 results, and guidance for Q4:**

Spoiler alert: The numbers are fantastic.

* Q3: Revenues of $61.2 million, an increase of close to 50% on a YoY basis.
   * Breaking revenues down: Subscription revenues up by 64% at $53.4 million, and advertising revenues up by 153% at $7.5 million
   * Paid subscribers increased by 58% on a YoY basis, and ARPU increased by 14% on a YOY basis. [See here the meteoric rise](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005911/en/fuboTV-Announces-Q3-2020-Results). Sexy, ain’t it?
   * Hours spent watching FuboTV also skyrocketed, an increase of 83% YoY (133.3 million hours). Monthly Active Users watched on average 120h per month. This is a 20% increase YoY
* Q4 guidance: Spoiler alert: They raised their guidance mid quarter because they are so bloody awesome
   * Q4 revenue to be expected between $94 to $98 million, prior guidance was $80 to $85 million. The new guidance represents a 77% to 84% YoY revenue increase
   * Paid subscribers to be expected to exceed 545,000, prior guidance was 500k to 510k. The new guidance represents a 72% YoY increase.

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young, FuboTV was founded in 2015. But you know what? It took ages for Netflix to become profitable (about 7 or 8 years, I believe). The way FUBO is growing their paid subscribers base, and the way the hours are increasing YoY, we can expect them to reach profitability sooner rather than later. When? I don’t have a crystal ball, if I do I’d be a billionaire. We can expect that as they continue to scale up and add more users, they will continue to increase their advertisement revenues (duh), and also that their cost of new client acquisition will become lower (also duh)

**What are the risks?**

* For FUBO to thrive and grow, they need live sports. COVID dented their growth due to professional sports suspending seasons. If we go into another massive lockdown (less and less likely as vaccines ever so slowly roll out), this could cause another dent in their growth.
* It’s still heavily shorted, as the price continues to go up (especially if they smash their guidance), expect some shady shit GME-style from hedge funds to bring the price down.

**TLDR:** Awesome growth potential, heavily shorted (not at the GME scale, but still heavily shorted so you need to be mindful of that and potential WSB attention to the stock, or potential shady business from shorters).

How to give Robinhood a Red Dildo (hint: don't go the class action route for max pain).,169,lalaqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalaqy/how_to_give_robinhood_a_red_dildo_hint_dont_go/,31,1612262005.0,"Dear WSB brethren,

&#x200B;

I  hate seeing the big players donkey fuck the market when their trades go tits up, and screw over the good guys. We all know that any sort of legal proceedings against Robinhood will go absolutely nowhere except maybe some heavy fines and more regulation that will handcuff retail traders more. If you were affected by Robinhood in anyway, and want to stick them with a big red dildo and go Sheriff Nottingham on them... ARBITRATION!

&#x200B;

Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) used to mandate Class-Action arbitration. Then in 2005, Big Tech arranged to remove that caveat so they could do super shady shit (and save on legal fees). It's pure idiocy, but it helps us out.

Read more here: [https://www.dltlaw.com/alerts/jams-revises-procedures-on-class-wide-arbitration/](https://www.dltlaw.com/alerts/jams-revises-procedures-on-class-wide-arbitration/)

&#x200B;

Here is Robinhoods User Agreement (Please screen grab this yourselves as companies have been known to modify it in the wake of arbitration proceedings..Patreon i'm looking at you) :

38. Arbitration.

&#x200B;

A. This Agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement, the parties agree as follows: (1) All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed. (2) Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. (3) The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. (4) The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. (5) The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. (6) The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court. (7) The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Agreement. **B. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement between Me and Robinhood, any Account(s) established hereunder, any transaction therein, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of FINRA Dispute Resolution, Inc. (""FINRA DR""). I agree to arbitrate any controversy or claim before FINRA DR in the State of California.** C. This agreement to arbitrate constitutes a waiver of the right to seek a judicial forum unless such a waiver would be void under the federal securities laws. If I am a foreign national, non-resident alien, or if I do not reside in the United States, I agree to waive My right to file an action against Robinhood in any foreign venue. D. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (1) the class certification is denied; or (2) the class is decertified; or (3) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Agreement except to the extent stated herein.

&#x200B;

This is where it gets good... California State Law (CCP 1284.3 if your following) states that in arbitration, consumers only pay for the initial filing fee. ***Robinhood pays all remaining fees.***

CCP 1284.3.

""(a) No neutral arbitrator or private arbitration company shall administer a consumer arbitration under any agreement or rule requiring that a consumer who is a party to the arbitration pay the fees and costs incurred by an opposing party if the consumer does not prevail in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fees and costs of the arbitrator, provider organization, attorney, or witnesses.""

Full Law:

[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=1284.3](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=1284.3)

&#x200B;

Other takeaway there is that FINRA has no rules to declare a arbitration ""frivolous"". The right to file is protected by the Federal Arbitration Act, and favorable Supreme Court rulings protecting filings as well.

[https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/printable-code-arbitration-procedure-12000#12214](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/printable-code-arbitration-procedure-12000#12214).

&#x200B;

If the millions of Robinhood users were to file for arbitration, they could not do it as a class action per California State Law. They MUST file individually. Robinhood would have to pay for arbitration individually. This would cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, and there's nothing they can do about it. They took money out of your pocket so now take money out of theirs.

&#x200B;

Respectfully signed,

A stupid retail trader

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

\*Robinhood User Agreement has a gaping hole in it. If you were financially harmed by their fuckery, file for arbitration.

\*State law prohibits class-action arbitration

\*Robinhood pays all costs except filing fees

\*Maybe you win and get tendies.

\*This could cost them a metric fuckton of money

\*Apes Strong Together

&#x200B;

They say Robinhood stopped its users from buying GME because of requirement with Clearinghouse,146,lal4ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lal4ku/they_say_robinhood_stopped_its_users_from_buying/,40,1612261437.0,"So now that the bleeding has stopped and the frenzy has subsided, there are fund managers, articles, and former TD Ameritrade CEO coming out on CNBC giving reasons why Robinhood halted trading for GME and other stocks. 

Let's just go over the order of events that happened and the ""not so subtle"" incentives behind this. Yesterday, in the clubhouse video chat, Elon Musk called out Vlad Tenev on this. He replied by saying something along the lines of ""regulatory requirement"" and to protect the users, etc. The most egregious thing he said was he didn't want to halt trading altogether so he stopped buying only to protect Robinhood and the Clearinghouse. There is some credibility to this logic but the way the events unfolded is suspicious and it is clear that this was not the thought process at the time of the decision and it was after the fact they came up with this to try to explain the real reason.

First of all, who benefits from halting the buying only? Hedgefunds. I think we would have all been upset but we would not have been ""harmed"" if Robinhood halted trading for GME completely. If RH halted GME trading altogether until they secured more funding to meet requirements, then I would have believed the excuse they gave - that they put restrictions to meet regulatory requirements. 

**TLDR: RH halted buying that only benefited hedge funds and harmed retail investors that bought into GME and then after the fact, they came out and said regulatory requirements.** 

If you really didn't have any ulterior motive, then why didn't RH warn us or give us a heads up? This was not a instant phenomenon. It was inevitable event that was building up over days. The volume was picking up and everyone knew what was going on. Are you seriously trying to tell me that all the people are RH had no idea about these deposit or regulatory requirements until 11:00 AM of the day? Did they have to suddenly put these restrictions mid-day and directly cause a massive price drop in GME?  Why couldn't they give these reasons at the time of halting trading? 

It's clear at this point - Vlad Tenev risked jail time to put restrictions on trading that only benefited hedge funds and directly harmed retail investors that already had money in GME.

Thursday (28th Jan): MM's/HF's executed a clear ladder attack - trading large stock holdings between each other, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off. Was there really? **Fuck no.** Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we 💎 HOLD 💎? Obviously.

In the hours and day following their attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us Ape's sold!

The cock jockeys at Wall Street have now had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Tried to hype SLV to distract and used media contacts to alter the story. What they are now doing is using a similar form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. **In other words they will try to keep the stock stagnant.** I wouldn't be surprised to seem them lever the price UP, to raise hopes only to ladder DOWN again to again alter the ""squeeze"" story.

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our positions (obligatory fuck RobinHood & IBKR).

**\*\*THE IMPORTANT PART:\*\***

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

No matter what people say or what you hear in the media - THEY CANNOT CLOSE POSITIONS UNLESS SOMEONE SELLS. Simple as that. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares^(\[1\]). Bottom line.

Now with this said please fucking read this:

^(\[1\])[Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

TLDR: *""the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before!* ***THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!""***

Short float is clearly not the be all and end all. Do not fall into this trap.

***I hope new retards that just joined WSB realise that this struggle between Retail Investors & Hedge Funds may take longer than you think.*** No one knows when (or fucking IF) the short squeeze will take place as expected. Be ready to HOLD for 2-3 weeks or even longer. We may have the an upper hand, but the hedge funds aren't stupid. They have been taking your boomer parents\* hard earned money for decades so be ready for several weeks of FUD, misinformation, and restrictions. Don't invest more than what you can lose. Be logical, go out, exercise, eat and sleep (stop looking at that fucking line 24/7). Try not to stay glued to the screen.

Helmets on. Cheers to remaining space-cadets together.

Once I can personally free up some capital from other stocks I like, such as GME, I will be looking into taking a net short position or obtain put contracts on NYT.  I of course wouldn't be too interested in NYT just yet. 

One of the key reasons I believe NYT is overvalued currently is because their business model is clearly failing. Revenue is going to crap. Here are a couple of headlines that demonstrate such bad business practices... remember I just don't like the stock

The truth behind media shilling and taking advantage of the ladder attacks,164,laksdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laksdu/the_truth_behind_media_shilling_and_taking/,27,1612260366.0,"Repost from a post I made in another thread. Not looking for awards - I'm looking for this knowledge/idea to get out there. 

So a lot of the newbies and paper hands are getting spooked by the decreasing price, but it's not a bad thing because the volume of stocks traded are the same. At the end of the day, those stocks are owed to investors by the short-sellers irrespective of the price. The fact that there are virtually no stocks to be traded apart from the ones being traded to each other (i.e. inducing ladder attacks) is where the problem lies for them.

That is the key point; hedges still need to buy the stocks to close their over-shorted positions. A low price is instrumental in allowing people to buy stocks back and will enable those who missed the first spike to get back into the game. With everyone being able to buy stocks at a lower price, we may have the firepower needed to re-commence the buying of stocks and finally induce the MOASS due to their heavily shorted positions.

**THIS IS WHY THE NEWS IS SO ADAMANT ON SAYING THE REDDIT ARMY HAS MOVED ON; THEY DO NOT WANT INVESTORS TO BUY IN AT A LOWER PRICE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ROYALLY SCREWED**. All their efforts will have been in vein and there will be even MORE longed stocks that are owed, thanks to investors who bough at that dip. This is why it is important to hold.

Honestly though, is this level 2 data?  Idk.  It tells you that bid/ask stuff that everyone keeps talking about.

1) Go here: https://www.fidelity.com/trading/advanced-trading-tools/active-trader-pro/overview

Download it and log in.

2) Once you've logged in go to layouts > new layout.

Here you'll create a new chart, a find your position, link it to level 2 data and get a real time quote- just like that, wow. 

3) Create a new chart to monitor GME.  Here you can modify it however you want.

https://i.imgur.com/7oXX2pv.png

4) Add a directed trade & extended hours tab.

https://i.imgur.com/Nj1oOCE.png

5) We'll link the chart to the directed trade & extended hours tab.
https://i.imgur.com/0oZNvn5.png

I like blue because it makes me feel better.

6) Add a real time quote, and link that with blue.  You can just do this by right clicking on the little chart button next to the field.

https://i.imgur.com/HQHG2ZF.png

7) Now go to account > positions and pull up your beautiful GME holding.  Then right click on GME, and go to find holding in all accounts.

https://i.imgur.com/Ij0MYkB.png

8) Link that with blue.

https://i.imgur.com/toTP4D9.png

Now you have the chart, the position you have, the streaming data, and a real time quote all in one.  Since they're linked you can switch them.

Again I just like pretty numbers, I have no idea what's going on and you should definitely not listen to me for financial advice- but it allows you to keep track just a weee bit better.

FEYE - Playing tomorrow’s FireEye Q4 earnings based on recent SolarWinds hack,22,laki1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/,8,1612259531.0,"Bullish on FEYE over next few quarters. To me it’s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren’t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I’ll take this as a bullish sign. 

I’ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They’ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  

Back of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. 

Any upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I’m not expecting much on this front. 

Finally, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn’t confirmed these rumors, he hasn’t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  

I’m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.",2021-02-02 11:52:11

-if the squeeze already happened, why did robinhood and many other apps block buying $GME recently?

-why are there bots spamming the same comment on every thread?

Whenever you start doubting whether the short squeeze already happened ask yourself all of these. It’s alright to be skeptical, but all the signs are in front of us. 

They would never be putting in so much effort if the squeeze already happened. If it did, it would be us against ourselves, and they wouldn’t give a shit. But it’s still us against them. That’s why all this bullshit is getting bigger and bigger.

The short side may be covering at the moment, but they can turn on a dime and resume short-selling as stock loan availability from previous short covers hits the market. If long-side buying turns into profit-taking, new short sellers may jump back into the fray and help push GME stock prices down.”

ICLN is a strong hold under President BUYDEN,15,lakgwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lakgwo/icln_is_a_strong_hold_under_president_buyden/,29,1612259431.0,"ICLN is an etf that holds a lot of green energy stocks - a lot of $PLUG power as well. It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy. 

Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :

1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement
2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline
3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today’s dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.  
4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation’s governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. 
5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he’ll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that’s not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable – including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute – affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities – without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ. 
6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his [infrastructure legislation](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure) incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.  

All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.

But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.

They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.

20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy

80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy

However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.

$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.

So why the huge upside potential?

One Answer: Papa Elon

Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.

I've noticed these questions are repeatedly being addressed and answered with grand conspiracies that implicate major legal and ethical improprieties.  First off, CNBC and now other news networks have been reporting since last week that Melvin closed their position.  This sub has repeatedly stated that this is fake news and Melvin trying to manipulate markets.  People in this sub are pointing to the volume, and the short interest estimates and saying it's impossible that they've closed.   If it's that easy to fact check something like this, how stupid would Melvin have to assume the media and the retail traders are?  Obviously if it's that easy to fact check it, CNBC and other networks would know if they are lying.  So is the implication that these networks are blatantly lying on the hedge funds behalf?  Wouldn't somebody at the network say, ummm these retail traders can look at the volume and see it hasn't been closed, we are not lying for you when it's so obviously a lie?  This leads me to my next question, which is related to last weeks surge in price.  The run up in price last week looked like a short squeeze. Remember this stock was trading in the teens a few weeks ago.  That run up coincides with the timeline of when Melvin and CNBC are saying Melvin closed.  Could that run up in price have been the short squeeze caused by Melvin closing?  I'm holding strong, added more shares today, but I wanted to start this thread because it feels like the GME thread is full of propaganda and conspiracies.  I wanted a refuge of critical thinking in this sub I've enjoyed for all these years.  If the accusations being thrown at the media and the hedge funds is true, these are big time concerns for the general public.  If the conspiracies and propaganda on this sub are going to cost people significant savings, that's also an issue.  Usually the truth lies somewhere in between, so I'm hoping this sub can cut through the noise and seek the truth.  I don't want this to come across as me raining on the parade either.

The Importance of Volume,247,lak7g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak7g6/the_importance_of_volume/,45,1612258643.0,"Hi guys,

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low\_volume\_pullback.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low_volume_pullback.asp)

""Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, **but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact.""**

This Zacks link goes into good detail on interpreting low volume and stock price manipulation:

[https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html](https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html)

"" Interpreting Price and Volume Action

Price action reflects investor sentiment. If a stock is rising, investors are eager to buy; if it is falling, investors are eager to sell. **But for a move to be valid, the stock price action must be confirmed by volume**. As technicians say, volume goes with the trend. **Volume shows how much conviction investors have in a trend.**

When you multiply the number of shares traded by the current stock price, you get the total dollar amount that investors are willing to put at risk. **Low volume means few investors are putting only a little money at risk. You cannot trust such price moves, as they are fickle and can easily reverse.""**

 

## Understanding Manipulation

**It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low**. **All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell**. **The goal is** to raise the price if he wants to sell and t**o lower the price if he wants to buy**. If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.

> Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

> In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

> **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

To nobody's surprise, Gamestop short sellers Fail-To-Deliver a whopping... 

~~5 MILLION~~

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

> Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

In order to keep your gains and or increase your profits and hurt the hedge funds more you need to do more than just hold. 

All you retards held however the stock still fell. Why?

Manipulation? Maybe.
But how do you beat the hedge and make the stonk go higher? 

You need to buy 

Let me explain

Imagine there’s a pie with four slices three slices are called for this increasing the price of the fourth slice. 
Overtime that slice gets traded higher and higher until there’s not many buyers resulting in low liquidity. 

Then one retard tries to trade that fourth slice of pie and can’t find a customer and sells at a loss and multiply that thousands and millions of times and the price keeps falling.

Along with that factor in RH and other platforms limiting buying and the buying and selling becomes imbalanced and basic economic supply and demand kick in. High supply low demand or low liquidity = lower prices. 

Finally add in bunch of retards switching trading platforms. Their money is going to be locked up for few days and if they’re transferring their shares or options it’ll be about a weeks time frame. Meaning they won’t be able to do anything in that time further hurting the share price. 

So how do we counter all these factors? 

All you apes need to keep buying at market price. The more people buy at asking price the higher the stock goes. Don’t buy NOK, AMC, BB or anything else. Stick to GME. If you’re not willing to do that then this is over. 

I’m not a financial advisor just another retarded ape.

Today I had 83 shares, 2 debit spreads and about 5k cash. Because RH is corrupt I couldn’t buy any more shares. I planned on transferring to Fidelity but my funds wouldn’t settle until Thursday (so depending on the withdrawal time I might not have my funds in fidelity until next week) and I wanted to get in on the dip. I would’ve just bought more shares but again, corrupt. Fuck RH. I hope Vlad goes to prison. 

Anyways I tried to buy another debit spread - buy the 2/5 240 call, sell the 300 call. Limited upside but also limited downside. Well those whores wouldn’t let me bc technically my other spreads count as 4 contracts.... the fuk? and you’re only allowed to have 5 contacts....THE FUK? 

so I ended up buying the 2/5 265 call. Obviously I’m getting porked on it right now and it dawned on me that those fuckers are supposedly limiting my buying IN MY BEST INTEREST when in reality it would’ve been in my best interest to let me do what I fucking want with my own money and buy the other leg of my spread. I’d be down a helluva lot less if RH let me trade freely. 

So in my mind that makes it one of 2 things. They’re either 
         a) completely in bed with MMs and Hedge Funds. When they say “being there for our customers” they’re talking about Citadel.

💎🙌 or death,73,lajqqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajqqy/or_death/,13,1612257282.0,"Woken by a sudden explosion from what seemed like only a few meters away, Private Boomer violently jumped to his feet and reached for his weapon between the dirty pile of clothes he made into a makeshift bed. “Those cocksuckers, will never let me rest”, he then uttered almost by memory “I must continue to hold my ground”. These words now burned into his mind, as he recalls they were once echoed by Private Boomer’s commander Major Cohen, whom he has not heard from in many weeks.
Not hearing from Major Cohen depressed Private Boomer as another night passed. It seemed the bombings were much greater in the night, after the markets have closed and everyone went home, blood can be seen on the streets. Private Boom is again startled this time by a familiar voice screaming in agony. Outside the window one of Private Boomer’s mate now lies half dead on the street.  Private Boomer is unable to make out the face of the soldier who now glances up at the window where Private Boomer is looking, making direct eye contact. 


The solider now laboring to breath, yells “do not look away, all of you!”, “it was the vendor at the market place.” Sobbing the solider continued, “I swear to you, first the vendor lined us up and refused to sell us any water, or food… Robin the vender at the market place is a spy, please believe me!”. His voice now fading as a panic crowd now gathered around the body. Another soldier can be heard saying “Robin would not do that, surely this solider is mad, tomorrow let us all surrender our gems to the Vin-Elm army first thing in the morning”. In a triumphant last gasp the dying solider yells “NO!”, the crowd immediately hushed, “Vin-Elm would have to take this from my cold dead hands”. The soldier’s body then jerks as he passed away clutching his gems, the only wealth he had left on this earth.

A loud knock on the door brings Private Boomer back into the dark dirty room. “I know you’re in there” said the voice. Fearing the worst Private Boomer looks back out the window into the streets, now empty, expect for the body of the brave dead soldier.  It was as if it were yesterday, a boy sitting at the kitchen table, eating tendies, without a worry in the world, these images flashed through Private Boomer’s mind. Private Boomer now remembered his wife, the days she would sneak him into the bedroom, in what seemed to be forever waiting for HIM to leave… fuck him, fuck Vin-Elm, fuck this war, I didn’t want this fight… “Private Boomer” said a voice which sounded like his wife’s boyfriend. “PRIVATE BOOMER”! 

The bewildered solider handed Private Boomer a letter, and said “it’s from Major Cohen, it’s to be kept confidential you autistic bitch”. “Okay” said Private Boomer. “Thank you sir”, said the solider as he left the room. Private Boomer did not know if he should read the letter, after all Robin is probably speaking to the Vin-Elm army at this very moment, preparing another bombing that will wipe out the rest of his platoon. 


Private Boomer slowly opens the letter.
“Hello Private Boomer, as you know the war efforts aren’t going as planned. My intelligence has uncovered a plot by Vin-Elm to destroy our army by destroying our supply chain. In your midst there are many spies, one in particular is named Robin. I pray your supply chain is not broken yet. However, if your supply chain has been compromised we do have a trusted source to the south, his name is Fidel (no not the communist dictator you autistic bitch). Fidel will help you restock in munitions, food and water. 

After that you must find a way to destroy Vin-Elm’s unlimited supply of money. Our unit has tried to invest is more GME aircraft, but were told by the banks they would limit our ability to acquire GME aircraft to protect ourselves from unnecessary risk. However, the bank continues to lend to Vin-Elm’s army at close to zero % interest despite their highly risky behaviors. Please plan accordingly, it will take a few days to reach Fidel from your vantage point. I will update you with good news shortly, please wait for that message. And one more thing, hold! “",2021-02-02 11:14:42

A Message to WSB,261,lajo6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajo6i/a_message_to_wsb/,52,1612257058.0,"First off, I want to say how proud I am of you retards. I've been watching people lose their entire life savings and still hold the line. I joined WSB in December (have been lurking for months prior with my buddies) and fuck has the time flown. I can't believe how much time (and money) I've invested into this subreddit. 

**One point I just wanted to mention is:** IF the brokers and MMs somehow manage to get away with very illegal market manipulation, in the open and in front of the entire internet, I personally won't be throwing the majority of my paychecks into the stock market anymore. Before the comments section obliterates both my self-respect and karma, I just have to mention that I definitely can't be alone in this. We've had 6 million+ users join us in the past month alone. Also, over 50% of Robinhood users own GME. This isn't just some ordinary situation where WSB loses money, this is a war between the corrupt 1% on Wall Street and the entire rest of the world. I've seen thousands of posts from people joining the cause from countries I can't even pronounce. 

Us coming out on the losing end of this one would just solidify to millennials and zoomers everywhere that gambling our money in the stock market wouldn't benefit us. Why would anyone be willing to play a game that is rigged against them? 

That being said, I truly do naively believe that the SEC or Congress will have to step in and chalk up a win for the fellas on WSB soon. If they don't, that's potentially millions of people and tens if not hundreds of billions that our future generation won't be willing to invest in our economy, just because the market could be manipulated against us without any serious repercussions.

But until that point, you'll have to pry my 100 shares of GME at $87.00 from my lifeless body if you think I'm going to abandon ship now. It's a cheap price to pay for some long overdue justice, not only for ourselves but for everyone in 08'. Furthermore, you'd be very wrong if you think I'm ever leaving this community full of wonderful, regular people trying to do something better with their lives. Loss porn is the only thing that gets me hard anymore and we all know there will always be plenty of that to go around here.

Hold the line, 💎🙌. I'll either be with you all on the moon or in the unemployment line. Good luck and godspeed retards.",2021-02-02 11:10:58
Theory: Paper hands might actually benefit diamond hands,70,lajnfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajnfo/theory_paper_hands_might_actually_benefit_diamond/,50,1612257003.0,"We're talking GME here. 

As we know, the short squeeze (SS) is not a matter of IF. It's a matter of WHEN. The HFs know this, WSB users that know half a thing about the stock market know this. Now, the goal of the HF isn't to cancel the SS, it's to make it as less expensive as possible for them. In other words,  [here is what their bloomberg terminal screen is showing](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/026/981/0bd0ed742059cd7f4c83882095aeb3752e45dfbfv2_hq.jpg)

Now comes my theory: paper hands, aka people acting on emotion because of FUD and panic rather than what the numbers say (volume, technical analysic, etc.) are benefitting both us and HF. By selling at a loss or a meager price (anything less than 1k$ is free money, remember), they're allowing HF to cover their shorts for cheaper. 

Let's say the HF have a price target on GME of 1000$. In other words, their Harvard quants calculated that at a certain point, they could cover all their shorts and make the SS happen until GME hits 1000 (what I call the D-Day). After that point, they will no longer need to buy anymore shares, ending their torture. They would have covered most of their shorts without going bankrupt. That means that their goal will be to tire us, spread FUD, throw ladder attacks until they can quickly cover their shorts from whatever the price will be to 1000$ (supposing 1000$ is the price they calculated is the more beneficial)

The HF goal is to not go bankrupt. Therefore, paper hands selling their shares could make the SS happen faster by giving more shares to HF (while giving us more shares for cheap, naturally) until the D-Day. 

It's a **win-win scenario for diamond hands**. Whether paper hands sell or not, **the SS WILL happen**. 

disclaimer: I know nothing about the stock market, I'm just theorizing. What do everyone thinks of this?

TLDR: Paper hands selling might make the SS happen faster for holders (as long as there isn't too many of them).",2021-02-02 11:10:03

Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! 

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.

Owning more than 100% of a company and you: how to generate unlimited gainz,84,lajjue,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajjue/owning_more_than_100_of_a_company_and_you_how_to/,16,1612256701.0,"So I've been thinking with all this bullshit about short selling: what if you owned more than 100% of a company?  Thanks to short selling, it's actually possible since short selling effectively creates more shares (even ""legitimate"" short selling where shares shorted are borrowed).

So how can you cash in if you own more than 100% of a company?  Easy.  Just gift the company some money and immediately pay it out in the form of dividends.  You'll receive more from the dividends then you put in thanks to the extra shares you got from the short sellers (who have to make payments in lieu of dividends), allowing you to do the same process again with even more money.

Of course, to do this you don't even need to own over 100%.  You can work with other shareholders to pull off this trick too, so long as the group together owns more than 100% of the company.

Almost 75% of all retail $GME orders were to buy (Fidelity). DONT BUY INTO THE FUD 🚀,2752,lajjs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajjs2/almost_75_of_all_retail_gme_orders_were_to_buy/,111,1612256697.0,"**IMPORTANT EDIT:**
I know this will read bullish and I am long $GME still so there’s that. However, please be mindful of seeking evidence for a conclusion &amp; making conclusions based on evidence. In other words, we should try to make decisions based on data, not trying to find anything that supports our decision at all cost. This post was intended to provide information &amp; data with a little analysis. Please attack it, poke holes in it, crucify it, share it on skeptical subs, and otherwise test it before making a conclusion. This is the way, and how we got as far as we did.

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC &amp; $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) &amp; news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 🚀🌙 

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab. 

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood &amp; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions  
• This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.  
• Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.  
\- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:**
Welcome to the end of the post. I’m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I’ll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:**
Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here’s the best I could do:

1–Retail made no dent so what to expect now?
- I don’t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2–Should I buy now or what?
- I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don’t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3–Smart money is leaving and you’ll be left holding the bag
- I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they’re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don’t use comments, you’ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I’m wrong

4–AMC?
- I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5–When selling then?
- I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don’t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I’ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don’t have to sell if you can lose everything. I’m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",2021-02-02 11:04:57
"Poll: If you executed JAN 29 ITM GME calls have you received your calls?

I myself am still waiting for my execution of $95 JAN 29 call option to be fulfilled by Ally Invest. While I am waiting, Ally has locked my account and prevented me from doing any trading stating that management at Ally made the decision ""to protect the firm"".  Even crazier, while on the phone with them this evening, they delivered the shares to my account. I logged back in tonight, **AND THE SHARES ARE GONE!**

I am beginning to really buy into u/johnnydaggers theory here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)

I think that clearing houses are having a hard time assigning shares because they don't know where the shares are.

\#DeliverTheShares

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Just got off the phone. Ally said that he saw the shares were there but they were removed because Ally was doing an update. He said he could see them on the ""back side of the house"", what ever the hell that means.

You all wanted photos, so here is the best I can do. I didn't take a photo when the shares were in my account, but I can still take a photo of when I tried to set a limit sell order to test whether or not I could trade. That you can see. (Don't worry I'm not out at $1,000 it was just a test limit.) in the photos you'll see I bought 10 shares and I had a call option. Notice how my GME holdings are also messed up, showing me down $13K on 10 shares?!?

&#x200B;

Edit 2: To be clear, I called Ally Thursday JAN 28 to tell them I wanted to exercise my option. They marked it down. They knew I wanted the shares.

Now I see everyone blaming robinhood for liquidity shit, but why did so many others follow suit? Almost all the brokers tried to restrict trading, but now it's being framed as just Robinhood.

Furthermore, why weren't there liquidity issues during the run-up in Tesla last year? That stock went up way harder just before it split and then continued it's run up.. no liquidity issues. I am sure other stocks have had similar runs, no liquidity issues.

Why all of a sudden now with gamestop? 

I swear these guys are going to get away with this shit if people don't start making a fuss over this. The news is really spinning this a completely different direction from where it should be, and the average american is clueless as to how are market really works.

As one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.

##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally. 

Lately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub. **I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.** 

If this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.

I say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla. 

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/hF93IIH

No matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us. *tips hat*

##What's next for GME?

There's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors. **This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.** This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME.

They are the FOUNDATION of the massive castle of TENDIES you will soon receive from Melvin and Shitron after we bend those fuckers over and take what is rightfully ours.

So in conclusion:

1.) If you do desire to show off your GME activity over the last day, mark your post flair as it rightfully should be as “GAIN”.

2.) CHANGE your mindset.  Why must you think of GME’s activity today as a loss?  It is an OPPORTUNITY for greatness as those fuckers run out of ammunition and can’t afford to keep the stock price lower. 

3.) BUY MORE GME to cement your status as the next multi-millionaire.  Do you think DFV became the alpha male he is by selling all of his GME like a paper handed bitch?  NO.  He’s held.  Does he mark his posts as “Loss”!?  NO.  They are his GAINS.

GME - 5 important thoughts and questions to consider,159,laj2rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laj2rv/gme_5_important_thoughts_and_questions_to_consider/,75,1612255344.0,"**(1)** Do we know if there is a resource for which we can track hedge fund movements? I know that they are a dark cloud of secrecy but DFV (and others who first had this GME stock idea) were able figure out that Melvin Capital was the one who was short. Where did he (and others find this info)? Since then, the news and everyone else has mentioned Melvin Capital so many times that we are taking for granted how and where this information is tracked? Given how much manipulation hedge funds are taking part in, it would be a huge asset to see as much information as we can about their positions.

**(2)** No one should make any decision on GME (or any stock) on emotions. Successful trades are the ones that are made based on on data.  That means we need accurate short data. What is the best resource for short data that is most accurate and most frequently updated?

**(3)** According to the below short info websites, I am seeing that there are 61.78 million short interest. If this is accurate, then GME will at some point go into a short squeeze. Its just simply the data. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the next day. I think the key would be a trigger which would overwhelm the suppression. An example of a trigger would be a positive earnings release or some new positive development in their strategic shift to e-commerce. If we have to wait, so be it. Why? Because we do not pay margin to wait. They pay margin daily for shorting. Remember that.

[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)

**(4)** For those of you who participated in the Tesla short squeeze, are there any lessons learned that can be applied to GME? There were a ton of shorts on Tesla. But Tesla kept announcing new exciting things and churning out improving delivery/profit numbers. The shorts got squeezed. Did these hedge funds try to short ladder Tesla? I'd imagine that the amount of positive news overwhelmed attempts to suppress Tesla stock price? Maybe that is what will happen with GME? GME is not Tesla but it does have tremendous potential with Ryan Cohen and a potential move to e-commerce. I'm wondering if maybe we will trade flat like this with ups and down until we get some kind of positive news trigger and then it will initiate a larger squeeze and perhaps will happen over a long period of time? Tesla, for example, rose dramatically in 2020 but it was kind of spread out through the year. If so, then we just need to be patient.

**(5)** I am seeing a lot of newbies ask very stupid questions. Please stop asking what the next GME is or what trade you should make or how high GME will get to or what price is a good price to buy at or what is an option. If you are asking these kinds of questions, then stock trading might not be for you. Why? Because you are not understanding what we do here at WSB. We don't give anyone instruction on what to do or what not to do. We discuss ideas, we discuss different options. There is an expectation that you come to WSB with basic knowledge. When you decide to do a trade or not do it, it is purely your decision. And then you live with the loss or gain. And please please use Google to learn the basics instead of coming here and asking what an option is.  I know mods are overly pressured right now in all they have to do with the extra members but perhaps we will need to consider banning people who ask these kinds of questions.",2021-02-02 10:42:24

If **supply** is **high** then price is **low**
If **demand** is **high** then price is **high**

But what if the **demand** was **high**, the supply was **low** and you, as someone whos **shorted** this stock, needed the **supply** to be **high** so price becomes **low**

Well...
What you could do is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting of stocks.

So you hatch a plan. You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with eachother at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the **same** stocks being traded. Its just seeing the **amount of times** the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is **high**.

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is **holding** isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if noone is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still **low**.

Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to **BUY** your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy **YOUR** stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be **FORCED** to buy **YOUR** stocks at whatever price **YOU** offer. This is the **squeeze**

The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If noone sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will **FLOOD** the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you **HOLD** no matter how much the price goes down. if **everyone** holds there is no **supply** and if there is no **supply** it doesnt matter how low the price is **SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM** so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will **HAVE** to **BUY YOUR STOCKS** no matter the **PRICE**.

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

Buy orders **(demand)** are more than sell orders **(supply)** and yet the stock lost value. 

This is why people are talking about **volume**. The **total amount** of stocks **(actual supply)** being traded is **low (price should increase)**, but **the total amount of times (percieved supply)** those same stocks are being traded is **high (price decreases)**.

You need to understand, it doesnt matter how low the price drops right now, the squeeze hasnt happened. the squeeze happens when the hedgefunds are **forced** to buy back. That is the squeeze, and it is what will skyrocket the stocks. Right now the hedgefunds are trying to prevent the squeeze.

So what are you going to do, give up? or capitalize on their fuck up? Every dollar the hedgefunds lose goes to us, but only so long as we own stocks. 

So **HOLD**, the price might drop but the rocket launches when the HF's are forced to buy back.

15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks,2034,laj1ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laj1ws/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder_attacks/,73,1612255273.0,"""Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/ https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction.""

I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor""

I believe that most people spend their lives and their savings to be conservative with their investments and not try to be the greater fool. They want to sit comfortably and ensure their retirement with the purpose of safety. But we are investing in something with a purpose to screw over those guys in their high towers laughing at us for being greater fools. Because of it a few platforms put trade restrictions because they were scared and cowardly from their losses. They felt how we did during the 2008 financial crisis.

I am reluctant to post this because I am an amateur investor, practicing nothing but conservative long-term trades, but today I took a chance—a really risky chance that may not pay out for me (well us) in the end—I bought a bit of GME what some may think is not that much, but for me, it’s a down payment on a house, it’s a new car, it’s remodel on a house... I do believe what we are doing will definitely be in case studies in business schools, possibly history books, but I believe what we are doing is great. We’re doing what those hedge fund guys didn’t think we had the balls or the means to do.  It temporarily paid off for us in the short, I’m hoping it will pay off for us in the long term.

Notice anything weird about their charts? The HFs are purchasing ETFs that have exposure to GME and are ""redeeming"" the shares inside of them to get access to the rights to a GME stock. They're using the redemption rights from the ETFs to then sell the stock without directly influencing the price of GME. 

Here's some proof from the top four ETFs with exposure to GME:

A great many of you who are participating in this sub are new to the community and many of you are new to trading/ finance altogether. I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.

Many of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. 

I pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:

**Shares Traded: 475,690**

**Average Volume: 106,230,000**

**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**

The closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10

During AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.

I rewatched ""The Big Short"" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn't work out it's because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.",2021-02-02 10:35:18

This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.

All of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We’ve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.

Yes, it’s a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.

So lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME’s case would put it at $30,000 per share.

As we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us 💎🤲🦍 are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.

I dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.

So lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.

The hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**

The hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. 

Andddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:
- GME shares
- SPY 374p 2/5
- SPY 300p 3/1
- SPY 250p 3/1
- UVXY 14c 3/1
- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds

TLDR: 🦍🦍🦍💎🤲🌈🐻

Edit:
To those of you saying I’m making up numbers:

[VW was shorted 12% and Porsche bought 43%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/ar-BB1d9yVI) 

GME as most valuable company in the world: $2.25T/69.5M = $32,375

I used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound.",2021-02-02 10:34:13

After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.

I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:

EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price 

GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png 

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png

For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.


We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:

Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.

Fubo stock on track to hit $200,11,lain3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lain3k/fubo_stock_on_track_to_hit_200/,20,1612254104.0,"Over the past few weeks, fuboTV has been caught up in the huge short-squeeze rattling through the markets because, well, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.

In the first half of December, fuboTV’s stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV’s subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo’s short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn’t just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock — and that’s because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV — unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week — is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Here’s the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn’t have live sports, live programming or news — three things which Americans still love to watch.

That’s why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service — somewhat like a “Netflix for TV”. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It’s differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

That’s a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long — and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

That’s a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days — but for the next few years, as well.",2021-02-02 10:21:44

**On the technical side, $TLRY has been improving all its bottom q/q even. See image below.**

&#x200B;

[As you can see, revenue has increased, cost of revenue decreased, gross profit increased and finally net income increased significantly since last quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/ilezgowoiye61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6215264f99816335fb9fe67c5d0edb78c275e4d)

With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q/q which is a great sign for investors. With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here. Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.

**TLDR; $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets. With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.**

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Silver squeeze not happening links:

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

ROBINHOOD IS A CHICKEN,78,laijn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laijn0/robinhood_is_a_chicken/,29,1612253808.0,"This is my theory and analysis by autist.  


1. On Wednesday, Hedge fund saw that they might go belly up and lose the billions. The only solution they saw was to restrict retail traders, who trade on Robinhood overwhelmingly. They asked in whispers IF Robinhood should put restrictions on these stocks. The reason can be formulated by the team of lawyers later. They knew very well this will upset the retail traders and might create an exodus of retail customers from Robinhood.
2. Hedge funds have few hundreds of millions in investment in Robinhood. HF realized it's okay to lose millions and save billions. HF might lose everything if the stocks ($GME etc.) continue to the ride to the moon. Hence the blockade.

This is a classic example of when Robinhood could stand up for us to the bullies and say

Is the SEC saying they are allowed to just leave it as undelivered indefinately then till the share prices dip to $3? Are the HFs going to just wait till december and just cover for $3 each cause no enforcement from SEC? Man if I dont pay the bill for $30 i get my wifi or electricity shut off, come the hell on.

I will give you updated calls and puts for today that expire this Friday 02/05!!!!!! (As of today, Monday)

Calls:. 

almost 80.000 40$ calls

Over 45.000 between 20-40$

Over 40.000 at 20$

Too lazy too count but like 90-100.000 13-20$


Puts:

Most of them 13$ and less.



This fucking means we need  to not let these puts fucking print. We need to close above 20$.  If we close above 40$ by some Elon Musk miracle tweeter, MANY SHORTS WILL BE FUCKED.


There are many many people who bet on this going 20+ by Friday.


Hedges might've bought 40$ calls in advance for this week to hedge their shorts.


Someone smarter than me may come with some squeeze theories here, but these are the options as of today.

GME failure-to-deliver for Jan. 1-15 was AT LEAST 1.13 million,203,laihdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laihdz/gme_failuretodeliver_for_jan_115_was_at_least_113/,30,1612253617.0,"That post that claimed that 5 million shares of GME failed to deliver in the first half of the month was wrong (they made the big brain move of summing a running total). BUT, we can still get an idea of how many shares failed to deliver with some better math. Here's the data from the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm). Each Failures number is *previous day's failures + new failures - settled failures*.

Date | Failures | Diff from Previous Day
----|---|----------------------
1/4 | 182269 | -
1/5 | 490723 | 308454
1/6 | 772112 | 281389
1/7 | 799328 | 27216
1/8 | 555658 | -243670
1/11 | 703110 | 147452
1/12 | 287730 | -415380
1/13 | 662524 | 374794
1/14 | 621483 | -41041

We know that if *n* more shares failed to deliver on a given day than the previous day, then at least *n* new failures to deliver occurred (maybe more, but those got cancelled out by settlements). Therefore, we can sum the positive differences and get a lower bound on how many failures occurred.

Doing so, we get that **AT LEAST 1.13 million GME shares failed to deliver in the first half of January**. Remember, this is a **LOWER BOUND**, as we didn't count the failures that were cancelled out by settlements. It ain't the 5 million that the other math whiz calculated, but 1.13 million ain't nothing to sneeze at.

What does that tell me? HOLD BABY HOLD!

CNBC -> NBC Universal -> Comcast ($CMCSA)

As another retard here put it, MSM news as we know will not exist by this decade's end. Say what you want about Trump, but his ""Fake News"" slogan caught on because everyone already knew what behavior he was referencing, it just didn't have a collective title yet (such as Karens).

Their propaganda on both sides has only gotten more blatant and its frighteningly working. Since when did people become so brainwashed that a valid political strategy during election night for the most powerful position in the world was: ""Stop the Vote!"" and ""Count the Votes!""????????? It's easier to accept that Trump was just that stupid, rather than know that IRL it's so beneath the president that Trump isn't even aware of that strategy. The big flu has only encouraged both sides to be so stuck in a thought bubble they literally can't even process what the other is saying.

Thats just how low they think of the population, the same people who now own more than 100% of existing (and counterfeit) GME shares.

FAILURE TO DELIVER,90,laifeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laifeq/failure_to_deliver/,25,1612253458.0,"Fails–to–Deliver — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares.

Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued. 

Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: **they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to 21 trading days** before they have to borrow a share. 

When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).”

Fundamentals traditionally are used to calculate share prices using financial data the company produces like sales, earnings, debt, investments etc.., so thats why they are calling us all out for being stupid cause GME isnt worth that much according to fundamentals. 

The dirty secret is that fundementals is an arbitary made up set of rules, the price of a stock only changes on supply and demand, has nothing to do with fundamentals. If enough people think a stock is legit, **it does not matter**, no matter how bad the fundementals are. Thats the whole point of a free market.

There are countless examples of companies with bad fundementals sky-rocketing. Tesla being the most recent and greatest example. Enough people beleived in the company, therefore the shorts got squeezed all of 2020, even though the fundamentals did not improve relative to the share price.

Please stop promoting Belfort,35744,lai796,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lai796/please_stop_promoting_belfort/,1267,1612252852.0,"I get it, a famous person doing memes in our favor is fun. We all love the wolf of Wall Street movie. But let’s be real here. 

Belfort is the epitome of what we’re up against as retail. He’s a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didn’t just get a slap on wrist from the SEC, he actually went to prison. 

He was just anti-GME a few days ago, and now he’s meme-ing in its favor? A meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub? 

It’s pretty clear to me. Belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund. There’s power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk. He sees the popularity and realizes the potential and impact that crowd sourced DD will do. He knows communities like this will grow. And he wants to use you. 

this is nothing more than seedy opportunist bullshit because Belfort realizes you’re the exact type of person who makes him rich- a retard who yolos into risky investments at the idea of massive % gains. he wants to capitalize on the popularity of GME and this sub. He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his “miNdSeT” when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught. 

Please. Stop. He is not your friend. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a “trading community” of his own: 

> “Belfort will share his favourite market sector in “Wolf Report” and give 10 lessons in “Wolf Mentality”, which includes tips on “what it takes to be a trader, how to handle emotions, the intangibles of success, how to take advantage of opportunities, and how to learn from your mistakes”.”

How to actually f**k the hedge funds over,168,lai5xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lai5xk/how_to_actually_fk_the_hedge_funds_over/,51,1612252772.0,"Someone just posted that lots of $800 calls were bought with 3/19 expiry: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Another post mentioned that short interest is down but why it might be misleading: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

What do these 2 posts have to do with what I’m abojt to say? Basically it is extremely likely that hedge funds are literally hedging their short positions by buying calls at $800 strike ($25M worth of calls according to that first post I copied). 

This is a huge opportunity to make them eat even larger losses. 

1. They haven’t really covered their shorts (by closing their original position). Therefore, they will continue paying interest to short GME and how long is that sustainable?

2. They ‘covered’ their short position by buying $25M worth of calls, which we could make worthless if GME doesn’t reach $800 by 3/19.

But what if GME goes to $400+ or IV goes up so that they sell their options at a profit? Good question.

This is the main problem, but to counter that we do exactly what we’ve been doing - HOLD AND BUY AT DIPS ONLY. This means GME’s stock price should be relatively stable and as a result hedge funds will lose on both their short and long positions. 

I know this means GME won’t go to the moon until 3/19, but after 3/19, it will moon like crazy because hedge funds will take a huge hit. You’ve already seen that screenshot of Melvin, Point 72 and Citadel taking double digit losses in January. Let’s make it triple digits!!

TLDR: To make the hedge funds lose, we keep GME stock price stable. To do that, hold and buy at dips only.",2021-02-02 09:59:32

A note from WSB

Hi Robinhood,

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “What the fuck is r/wallstreetbets” 

We understand that the temporary limits you placed on certain stocks this past week was due to the fact that you can do whatever you want and face no real consequences, especially since you built Robinhood to take advantage of young idiots like us. We have always sought to make ridiculously high risk yolo plays based on emotions and we will continue to do this because we are degenerate knuckle draggers. 

To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we listed a few points about ourselves below. 

For WSB to operate, we do not need a collective motive. We called u/deepfuckingvalue stupid for months before he unlocked green mode.


We dont need to have a reason to jump tits deep into a stonk, and although you want to think this was a coordinated attack, most of us can barely read. We also dont have deeper level cognitive abilities here. We had a guy drink his own urine for nothing more than fake internet points. 
  
Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, we gained over 5 million subscribers. Despite the media narrative, this is not a political movement. This isnt occupy wall street 2.0. This is a collective of the kids who ate glue and paint chips as children, and like a blind squirrel we found this nut. 


We hope you take away this: at r/wallstreetbets we are nothing more than everyday smooth-brains participating in the markets. Standing by our WSB community means this. We will die holding these shares for nothing more than the ability to say fuck you. We have done a lot more in the past for much less in return.  If you think we are scared to lose money by being dumb, you are wrong. Thats who we are. 

Thank you for sucking our dicks. My wife’s boyfriend tells that feels good

Sincerely,

WSB",2021-02-02 09:57:33

As ive been sitting today from market opening and looking at [numbers like this](https://imgur.com/a/420z1fN) for hours on end having my small Rainman moment, ive noticed that a lot of those trades had 3 or 4 decimals, which indicates that those trades couldnt have been done by us retards.

Anyways, 1989 trades made between 3.30-4.00 p.m today had 3/4 decimals which tells us that at least **48,99%** couldnt have been made by retail. Also not every Fund will buy/sell with 3/4 decimals, so we can probably assume the number to be higher.

Slv etf is not like other stocks. They can create and retire shares at will.

The way it works is authorized investors are able to buy baskets of 50k shares in exchange for the equivalent delivery of silver bullion. 

This delivery to the slv trust creates shares. 

These authorized participants can also buy 50k shares and retire them in exchange for silver bullion withdrawal.

If the etf becomes over valued, an authorized participant can buy silver on the open market (or go to their vault where they have the physical silver purchased already at a lower price) and deliver it to slv trust to receive 50k shares which they can then sell at the over valued market price risk free Arbitrage. 

It seems like some hedge fund is trying to unload silver in mass and is using the hype around wsb as a Catalyst for a price run-up.

Technical Analysis of GME and Reality Check,147,lai275,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lai275/technical_analysis_of_gme_and_reality_check/,161,1612252461.0,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, and nor am I writing this as financial advice. This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME. Many of you will hate my perspective. You will call me a (insert rainbow + bear emoji (I am write these on word so yeah)), you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud. But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into. And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective. 

I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub. This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter. However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn. And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of. 

However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS. Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so. This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading. I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you. And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money. 

There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you “Ride the trade, until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point. So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend. This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations. I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts (Technical Analysis). 

My Technical Analysis approach: I am an intermediate term momentum trader. This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5-15 days. The tools I use are the following:

· RSI: Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.

· MACD: This is trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock

· Volume: Speaks for itself

· MVWAP & SMA: Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter-term trend. (MVWAP: Pink Line, SMA: Teal Line)

I usually use a mix of the 15 & 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.

Chart (A): Below you will find the 15-minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading. Each data point represents a 15-minute segment of trading. The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre-market and after-hours trading. 

&#x200B;

[Chart \(A\) 15 minute intervals](https://preview.redd.it/lay0kxbpdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0639aa416de5f96a4228d5e8b4cb7fa3b5c3d973)

Tuesday of Chart(A) shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours. This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers (This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions). Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart (Bulllish). The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well (Bullish). And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day “Green”. However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after. 

Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid / ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session. Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and/or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes. Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security. 

Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur; 1) the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2)MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3) The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well. 

To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well

&#x200B;

[Chart \(B\) 1 Hour Trading Intervals](https://preview.redd.it/3gt2em3rdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe04b217967c20a258e4e9ad1606ee6ec3dbed0)

As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term (1 hour Chart). Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period (1 hour intervals), and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading. At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence. That the RSI has neared “oversold” territory (anything below 30 is considered oversold). And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.  

As I said earlier, “You ride the trade until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside. Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security. Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time. 

I hope I am wrong. I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon. I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma Ramp. But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.

Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive. But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture. Be a fucking robot. 

For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim.

Hi CxXxXXxXx,

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?” 

We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms. 

To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below:
For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds. 
We hope you take away this: at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.

Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.
Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team",2021-02-02 09:54:19

And Biden's plan to ""buy American"" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.

Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.

After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.

I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits. 

I almost didn’t go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and I’ve been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and I’m sure many of you have gone through same thing. 

For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.

I know it’s irresponsible of me to throw everything I’ve made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still don’t know what’s gonna happen. I’ve come to terms with the potential loss and all the work I’ve done to get here, but I am HOLDING.

I have been in way worse financial positions and I’ve always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay. 

Do what you must.
Money will come and go. See this through.
Keep those diamond hands.

FireEye has the best incidence response for cyber attacks in the USA and were contracted heavily during the SolarWinds attack tens to hundreds of companies last quarter. They have seen some rougher quarters while dealing with debt and company reorganizations. They should post above expected earning this quarter which are released tomorrow after hours.

This morning we got some good news for Nokia. We got an upgrade from to a buy after the Ericsson quarterly results. And other assorted good news below

[Bidding for 5g C band has moved to the next stage (1-26-2021)](https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/nokia-ready-c-band-gear-heels-5g-spectrum-auction)

This bodes well for Nokia's quarterly report on 2/4/2021. Mind you, it doesn't automatically give us a win but this is a good sign. It also gives us a little insight into the sector and it looks to be doing well according to Ericsson.

We also got to see something a bit unusual today. Since NOK was thrust into BANG a week ago its been trading in lock-step with GME and the others. 

https://preview.redd.it/1imxzielcye61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f723f24c2aa6a1936be05a6f3659d33110efbb2

For the first time today we saw a much needed decoupling. GME (unfortunately) was down for the day and NOK was up. They did move together at one point but then started to diverge towards EOD.  I think if the run on NOK is to be successful it needs to distance itself from GME's gravity.

As we start ramping up closer to earnings  I want to remind everyone try not to sell for pennies and hold. That's the only way we are going to get North of $10 and breath much needed life into this stock. 

TL;DR

Gud news make NOK NOK go Brrrr  
This stonk has more shorts than you think  
This stonk can move like a demon when buyers jump in  
Earnings on the 4th will let us know if the hype is real. A lot is riding on this

Volume based TA,116,lahtvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume_based_ta/,37,1612251816.0,"This is a quick post to show my drawings that I did with whats left of my edible crayons. The main thing I want to key in on here is how volume weighted price levels effect market psychology and momentum. I'm not really trying to make price predictions, just trying to give some basic education to the noobs.

The yellow moving average in this first chart is VWAP (volume weighted average price). For those that don't know, VWAP basically takes the average price over some period of time and then normalizes it by how much volume occurred at various levels over that same period of time. VWAP is interesting because it helps understand who is in the drivers seat w/ regards to momentum (ie if price is above VWAP then majority of bulls are ITM and feeling good but if price is below VWAP then longs are in the red and shorts are ITM). As you can see, price broke above VWAP in the pre-market on the 26th and then shit got wild. Then price broke below VWAP on the 28th and we still haven't recovered back above it. 

At this point VWAP is going to act as a sort of resistance and the reason why makes sense when you consider the psychology of market participants. If you imagine VWAP representing the level where the most amount of buying has happened, then you can imagine that as we retrace back up to VWAP traders that have been in the red are suddenly coming back to break even. As they get back to break even some people might decide to cut their losses and sell. This is why we often see large moves followed by a touch back to VWAP and then resumption back in the same direction as the original move (hard to see on this chart but this happened at 9am on 1/28).

https://preview.redd.it/sbholl924ye61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5fabb135a5460e354ceca7cefc65726e3eba1fd

Ok, now we're going to look a slightly more fancy VWAP. In the chart below I added in an anchored VWAP which I anchored to the top of the pre-market move on the morning of the 28th. This is basically representing the obvious that since that point around $480, most buyers are underwater. Intuitively it makes sense that it is above the normal VWAP because the normal VWAP is accounting for buying that happened at lower prices (before the spike up to $480). 

https://preview.redd.it/nyt1czwv9ye61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ebac0da0fdf794e33436a95b48519ddbe55e808

Ok, personally I find this final chart most interesting and IMO it suggests that we might revisit the $80 range. This is called volume profile and its basically just showing the volume of buying that occurred at different price levels. I decided to have it calculate this starting from the market open on the 26th (things really got crazy after that) through current -- admittedly starting it here was a little arbitrary but still informative. 

Anyway, as you can see, the majority of the volume that has traded since then happened at $80. Then there was a secondary spike of volume around $330 and a tertiary spike around $240. These levels will also act as  sticky points moving forward for the same reason that VWAP will...psychology. Consider the current situation. price is above the 80 primary volume level but were clearly looking pretty weak and dropping back down. If you were a buyer at $80 you would still be ITM but you would maybe start to question the strength/outlook of this as you slowly watch your gains disappear...maybe you would even start to sell a bit while you still have profits to sell...I think a lot of people would.

Something else to notice about this chart. Notice how there is a complete lack of volume between 190 and 150? I would expect price to move VERY quickly through this range as there isn't much prior action here. Given that we're already in the middle of this range after hours I would expect we hit 150 tomorrow (or tonight) and then maybe even closer to 80 tomorrow or the next as that will act as strong support. 

https://preview.redd.it/5y00ytbeaye61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=b44df91956e9f435900d4f32b3fc5d72efcf8f07

**TLDR: We won't see upward momentum pickup until we break above some of these key volume weighted levels. The reason is due to the psychology of market participants and the fact that most people are currently underwater and wanting to cut losses when price starts to get closer back to their cost basis.**

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER! This same psychology applies to large funds. They are so fucking deep underwater at the moment and when they start to get back to their cost basis they will take the opportunity to cover. In other words, the dip was expected....hold strong and the covering will start. 

&#x200B;

Hold strong retards. This isn't financial advice and i'm not trying to influence anybodies decisions in any capacity. These ideas are my own and you need to assess risk/opportunity for yourself.",2021-02-02 09:43:36

Thinking Outside The Box,93,lahtqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtqu/thinking_outside_the_box/,51,1612251806.0,"Seems like the hedge funds pulled some shenanigans on Thursday and moved their positions. I know people have some argument on trade volume but Barron's published an article wherein they discussed how Hedge Funds could have bought up ETFs in which GameStop was in and then redeemed the ETFs for all stocks in that ETF from the provider to cover their shorts.  Therefore no actual trading in $GME needed if done this way simply swapping ETF.

I have a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the S3 release but we plummeted today - lets be clear.

From here on, it seems like we're waiting for the NASDAQ report on the 9th to have some more conclusive data on where the Hedge Funds are at. That's a long time to wait.

We need to stop posting loss porn and stop talking about holding and take an evening to discuss where we're at in this battle because it's extremely unclear in my opinion.

Would the ETF theory impact share price? Is there a way that they got out of their short positions regardless of trade volume? How will the put expiry impact price? How does the sudden influx of newcomers selling all their shares at the slightest dip reposition us? Could they create a self fulfilling prophecy against us as we did to them? How long can they bleed interest and is it cheaper than covering right now? 

Seems to me that this could just be a slow bleed to the bottom if we're not careful and we begin really examining where we're at.",2021-02-02 09:43:26

Email From Robinhood,68,lahod6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahod6/email_from_robinhood/,57,1612251407.0,"
A note from Robinhood

Hi Gay Bear,

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?” 

We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms. 

To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below:
For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds.**
We hope you take away this: at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.

Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.
Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team",2021-02-02 09:36:47

Concerns about this sub. A cult-like mentality is starting to form. And its dangerous,2010,lahmei,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahmei/concerns_about_this_sub_a_cultlike_mentality_is/,480,1612251251.0,"So preface, I'm not a bot and my positions are short on the S&P 500. I think this GME squeeze will cause a liquidity crisis so the market corrects. So GME going up is good for my account.

I've been on this sub for a few years and its rise in popularity the last few weeks has brought some concerns to me. Namely that this sub has the potential to drive some serious cult like behavior. 

This GME squeeze is an interesting story, it started out as a play to make a metric fuckton of money and has grown into some weird psuedo-social movement, or at least disguised as one. You have people new to trading (As seen by the constant questions asking basic questions about the market) on this emotional trip to steal from Wall Street and give unto themselves. In an era with a lot of uncertainty due to the rona I get it. 

My concerns now is there seems to be a quickly rising culture of if you do not love GME you are a bot/dissenter/evil wrongdoer with the intent to take the ship down. And I agree there has been a lot of not so legitimate people here the culture is slowly turning to join the hivemind or go. I am already seeing people talking about ""our next target"" as if this is now some group intended to take down wall street from within.

This sub has made this short squeeze a little guy vs Wall Street thing, and while there is plenty of shady shit going on, people don't seem to understand there are institutions long GME, they want to take Melvins money just as much as you. It's a short vs long battle. 

That whole Robinhood fiasco, it was a legitimate issue handled HORRIBLY. They ran out of money and were going to go insolvent, and they handled it quite possibly the worst way, adding even more fuel to this us vs them fire.

""It can't go tits up"" -  Words someone says right before it goes tits up. A lot of you all will make life changing money off GME, and I am glad for you. But you also have to understand for a lot of yall, you're going to lose. The market giveth and the market taketh away. I've blown up my account twice so I've gone through the emotional rollercoaster before. I remember my first 10 bagger off TGT when $BECKY was memeing. I am worried that for those people this GME play goes tits up on, someone will wrongly focus that energy into being someone else's fault and not them not understanding the play they were making.

This sub has grown exponentially and the mods have been doing there best, however this one tweet definitely added fuel to the fire in my opinion, 

https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1356338243554304001?s=20

I think this perpetuates the message that its someone else's fault GME went down today and that the ""elites"" are out to get us.

This is reminding me of an Alphabet soup themed cult. And we all see how that's going.

This sub was always about making money and being dipshits doing it. And I am worried that culture is going to transform into something much much worse. My biggest fear is that people who blow up their account off this play are taken advantage of by others and lead down some crazy shithead path.

Edit: I can't blame the mods for this. There is no handbook on how to handle every news outlet picking up your subreddit. They've been doing the best they can and I applaud them.",2021-02-02 09:34:11

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887\_Naked\_Short\_Sales\_and\_Fails\_to\_Deliver\_An\_Overview\_of\_Clearing\_and\_Settlement\_Procedures\_for\_Stock\_Trades\_in\_the\_US](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887_Naked_Short_Sales_and_Fails_to_Deliver_An_Overview_of_Clearing_and_Settlement_Procedures_for_Stock_Trades_in_the_US)

""Two possible reasons for intentionally engaging in naked short selling are: (i) to short sell stocks that are difficult or impossible to borrow; and (ii) to conduct manipulative “bear-raids” on stocks. When borrowing costs are high, market makers sometimes choose not to borrow and instead naked short sell.6 In such cases naked short selling, then failing to deliver is economically equivalent to borrowing shares at a zero-fee zero-rebate equity loan plus the expected cost of being forced to buy back the stock and deliver it (a process called “buying-in”). In difficult-to-borrow stocks, this amount can be less than the cost of borrowing.""

""The Buy-in procedure, on the rare occasions that it is used, is unlikely to force a naked short seller to close out the FTD; the Stock Borrow Program effectively facilitates a zero-fee zero-rebate loan to the naked short seller; and the fees for failing are insignificant.""

""Because the incidence of buy-ins is low and penalties for failing are small, naked short selling effectively is a way of short selling difficult or impossible to borrow stocks.""

&#x200B;

TLDR: this stuff's messed up and it could take months to unwind it all. Melvin and the other shorters get a **zero-fee loan** and can wait out for months. 

And we need the SEC to look into this predatory practice.",2021-02-02 09:29:38

What a feeling.

Almost overnight, our success transformed u/deepfuckingvalue's humble internet-forum analysis into an international fucking movement and a rallying cry for billions of people to protest society's disgusting wealth inequality and for a moment, just a tiny moment, reap the rewards of a level playing field.

On Wednesday, Gamestop blew up and the stock went from 88 to 460 in a matter of two days. The MOASS was just around the corner, and tens of thousands of average joes were about make life-changing money off a ballsy play that turned out to be fucking right.

We all know what happened next.

R\*binhood, Web\*ll and other brokers halted all buying of GME, right at the very peak of the flood of buying and global unity. In other words, THEY CHANGED THE RULES OF THE GAME RIGHT BEFORE THEY LOST. We knew they would pull some shady shit (slander us on CNBC, lie about short interest, ladder attacks, etc, etc) but we never expected them to destroy the free fucking market as we know it.

And that is why I wrote this post and why I sold most of my shares Friday and today. I will die believing that GME would have hit 1000 if they did not do what they did on Thursday, but none of that matters now. What matters is that the game has changed, and anyone who hasn't caught up with the new rules are going to get screwed.

CNBC are a bunch of crooks, but when they said that people would lose money buying at the top, they weren't wrong. Even if the MOASS did happen, there would've been people buying at 800,1000 and selling on the way down.

I'm not going to tell you to sell, because you'll just accuse me of being a cuckolding Melvin intern, but if you bought in GME at 300,350,400 with money you can't afford to lose then I'm asking you to reevaluate the current situation compared to when you bought your shares and the likelihood of a MOASS.

Don't throw away your life savings just because you're angry. Don't double your student debt because you can't accept the game is rigged.

I'm still holding 25 shares and hope to God this shit still goes to $1000. But I'm no longer dreaming about 7-figure gains, I'm dreaming about Vlad, Steve Cohen, and all the other cronies involved being sent to jail. This isn't about money any more, it's about justice.

As long as we never forget what happened these past few weeks, how they fucked the law and average American in plain sight of the entire fucking world, then we are still fighting. Email your local congressperson, post about it on social media, delete R\*obinhood and W\*bull.

Twinkies for Tendies: Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies),61,lahib2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahib2/twinkies_for_tendies_long_thesis_on_hostess/,45,1612250916.0,"# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

Twinkies to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue](https://imgur.com/a/sUYpaue)

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…now they’re going to make us some Tendies™ as well.

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you’re looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***",2021-02-02 09:28:36
A letter from Robin Hood: More wishy-washy explanation: Let RH go broke,90,lahhqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahhqk/a_letter_from_robin_hood_more_wishywashy/,56,1612250868.0,"A note from Robinhood,  


We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?”   


We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   


To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [**a letter to our customers**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHh6lgFyOgotlCTJW8UC1di71-2FN8W9HLDeGxWC4U5aEavH91h1h75nfEoi40O-2BJp241os1OXbwqcvqJ1wx8fRtdZa4yPHJd3VaV9ZmuiW1Y8kIkOs_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X95ijU64uSuhF1vPTW00ASBRnRYzE5nDEQo9kVCzyEPt6JRUURrNQwUEmhfgeIfRCW86mSXVtX2-2BS9LhHDNVmjdC8lpjCulKPt7v9hOTXzII645jTe2IqLIFCc-2BmHCi-2BVQ0W0yUI6HviMaE33-2BukVQvcPGCCZWjFtJsTSMS75-2BCmQbOmWbm8feSSdfOQpH08fSwx12NTBbXE46HOsa1cV-2F8j-2FJeCqDt-2BXbwuLJgrJb24pZiEuECgjY5seWaf5QttGF) and captured the key understandings for you below:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [**volatility**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHmU2zwU4-2BFOOGZok1-2F2HV-2Fzt4c20N8xojDAhUgt8a3TK7RBIb22WdVUS4CSdTwvVnbL52f-2Bl-2B207nVUod7i4WaLCWuNNQ0d6ZEsoYQX1fJMiDjMpPyfpE5mx0X2MvnOeoHr6A6U-2FzwqHV0iErJeKPLQ-3DnV5W_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X9VYayMHndG9bc69FjYlFlBsnTLvcEmpwFADktwS-2FAiCthQb5eIXGICHKIXTUooIxlznBo2QuHSt5fTyQSM3bWTvOlnZ5Rw0HejdBRUuBqCDvGDfDHVW2FT32HtCv3394-2BPZT3FpK3djP6sjWKPDsfK-2FuGZEQcZOAkV7VomUXBokliAnU4rdpoYGDbxHrKZD8NZbgtcmYBc9NKzZWO4dxsyP4nguFNZ-2BMW8EJK39Dh6Rf2xHhOpvmykRfeKuPL-2BnQU) in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds**. 

We hope you take away this: **at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets**. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.  


Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.Sincerely,

The problem is, if they truly ran out of money, why wasn’t buying halted altogether? Stocks like Tesla, apple, Amazon, etc, those all still continued to trade, meaning that they still had funds to clear.

Nasdaq posted an article on January 29th saying that the GameStop short interest was at 121.07% [link here](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31?amp), and S3 Partners lost credibility in my eyes by contradicting themselves on the same day on a Sunday.

This is NOT financial advice, but what I believe is that the price is being manipulated as low as possible before they REALLY start to cover.

I only have 1 share, so I don’t really give a shit, I bought in at $376 on Friday and I’m okay with watching it burn to the ground.

What if GUH was always right about those APL puts?,30,lahekn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahekn/what_if_guh_was_always_right_about_those_apl_puts/,34,1612250613.0,"I know I'm retarded and so are all of you. I have a theory, so I'm going to need all of you to assemble your remaining brain folds and hear me out on this.

Before the GME squeeze, RH was an ally to the retarded retail trader.... Everything changed when the unthinkable happened and the ADHD autist stars aligned and we collectively found some stocks we really liked.

In light of this, it has got me thinking..... What if RH was implemented by the wealthy to see growth of this sub and open the floodgates of ridiculous trades. Not only do the wealthy profit on the retards in retail investing, but there is another key reason:

The wealthy can watch the sub and Fuck with peoples' lives as entertainment.

This brings up GUH... This hero was very vocal about his irresponsibility on his tit-leveraged YOLO. He also had lots of people telling him how bad of an idea it was for him to execute the trade, but STILL..... The man was stoich on those bad earnings report and the sanctity of his PUTs.


Now retard, listen..... Pretend you are wealthy af, watching the peasants make trades on their dinky platform and discussing them here with the other autists. Your wife is busy with her boyfriend, so you decide to open up WSB and browse. This is when you find ControlTheNarrative's thread.

You cackle maniacally and immediately start talking to your other rich friends about this retard, until it's realized that those APL puts will print because the Autist is right.

As a group of wealthy people with mr and Mrs whispers everywhere, it would be incredibly easy to imagine a scenario where they would be aware of this potential mass gain on the most retarded trade ever formulated.

Well..... As the wealthy, we can change his fate for our own entertainment.

Autists... It is imperative we recognize the information we have learned over the past week and realize that the commission free brokerage we've used has been an instrument of the people who have the capacity to control the reality of users like controlthenarrative.

What if he was right? What if that big YOLO you made that resulted in the devastation of your life was a result of your thread about the trade being read by a wealthy person who was willing to pay to a small fee to see your life go to ruins?

All the desperation I've seen from Wall Street, politicians, news outlets, etc.... I can't help but ask:

How long has this gone on for? How many lives have been affected at the hands of rich people with the same access we have and vested interests in the flagship trading platform?

You can't make me believe that the wealthy wouldn't take pleasure at bullying retail investors for their own entertainment, especially when they have the power to control the fates of any bets made.

Maybe GUH was on track to win a massive gain on ridiculous leverage and wealthy people caught wind and decided to do something about it? 

Guys..... Maybe everyone should stop posting the YOLO's until after the trade is made?

GME Fails-to-Deliver Trending Downward,30,laheh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laheh9/gme_failstodeliver_trending_downward/,50,1612250605.0,"NOTE: The most recent data is January 15th.

What is coming next 🚀✨🙌🏻💎✨🚀,747,lahcyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahcyj/what_is_coming_next/,126,1612250490.0,"FOR RETARDS THAT CAN NOT READ: Open Google and search Volkswagen squeez. Look at the chart, look at the dates, compare to GME. We could fall even lower, we can only win by not selling! SOON💎🙌🏻🚀

This month I have learned that the world we are living in is rigged. I have learned that the media that I was watching before are lying. I have learned that there are almost no consequences to market manipulation as it is cheaper to pay fines then actually lose. 
I think as a community we have learned so much more about the financial system and who is and who is not on retail investor’s side. 

I could never have imagined that the media can be so easily manipulated. Today’s news about the silver got me laughing good when I first saw it, but then I started to get worried. This kind of manipulation is hard to withstand, especially for small investors like us. A stock dropping from 350 to 188 is worrisome. 

However it means only one thing, and it is that they are on their last days of existence. I have no idea what more shady manipulation they will come up with. But one thing is for sure, If everyone hold, there is just no way that they will be able to win it. I don’t care how much they manipulate us, how much they are paying others to say things. The only thing I care about now is that they lose and we win. They have not closed their positions, they have lost half of what they own. Think about stepping into their shoes, think about losing cars, yachts, wealth generally that everyday normal people will never have. I would for sure do anything in my power so that normal people would not take it all away from me. Think about how bad they will look for the rest of their lives if they lose to a bunch of retards on a Internet forum, they will not only loose money, but clients too. 

What I am trying to say is that it is up to you now. It can even take a bit longer then we anticipated. However if you sell, you will lose, and if you lose other normal people will lose, and if normal people will lose then the wealthy hedge funds and wealthy greedy people will win. I could cash out now and still make about 300 percent, I have been thinking about it. I came to a conclusion that being retarded is what makes us so strong. I don’t give a fuck about small amount of money, I want to cash out big time, over 1000 USD per share big time. I want everyone of you to look at the Volkswagen chart when it squeezed. How many days it took, and how low it fell before that happened. If GameStop falls to 100 so be it, if it falls even lower, SO BE IT. you are in control, the only way out for them now is that everyone will just get tired of this and sell. 
We could win big time here, we could tell this story years to come, sitting in the bars, sitting with our kids, sitting with our friends, and sitting here together. A community where people from all over the world came together and fucked over some wealthy dicks that feed on normal people like us. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎

💎🙌Comprehensive GME Diamond Hand Strategy Guide💎🙌,933,lahcsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahcsd/comprehensive_gme_diamond_hand_strategy_guide/,91,1612250480.0,"“If you **know** the **enemy** and **know** yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you **know** yourself but not the **enemy**, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you **know** neither the **enemy** nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”  - Sun Tzu

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.

What the enemy is doing:

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess\_who\_owns\_tonnes\_of\_slv\_options\_fuck\_citadel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/)
      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.
4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\_case\_you\_needed\_proof\_that\_there\_are\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)
5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\_short\_squeeze\_the\_whales\_have\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\_stjerne\_is\_da\_real\_mvp\_he\_his\_friends\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\_square\_right\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume\_is\_low\_dont\_believe\_the\_news\_no\_one\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume_is_low_dont_believe_the_news_no_one_is/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the\_volume\_of\_gme\_has\_plummeted\_the\_past\_few\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the_volume_of_gme_has_plummeted_the_past_few_days/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/)
3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated***\*:\* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\_volume\_is\_low\_shorts\_arent\_covering\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)
4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\_is\_so\_satisfying\_to\_look\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market. You bet that the government and SEC will be involved soon if this is true, and things will explode to the stratosphere. Read the following and ponder yourself, I'm not a financial advisor, just a dumb ape. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)[https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow\_the\_crumbs\_gme\_exposed\_the\_meta/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
6. ***We're getting smarter:*** Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.
7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.

Some proper DD to explain why $NOK isn't a bot stock and you should actually pay attention to it. 🚀🚀🚀,187,lahby4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahby4/some_proper_dd_to_explain_why_nok_isnt_a_bot/,76,1612250433.0,"I've been reading a lot of you posting about the fact that $NOK is a bot stock and that it's being posted to distract people from $GME.

Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.

I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.

&#x200B;

That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.

*This is not financial advice, do your own DD.*

&#x200B;

Let's start with financials:

The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.

Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.

They are siting on a total cash balance of **over 8 billion dollars.**

The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying 4.90$ per share for 1.92$ in Cash + Nokia's assets.

The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.

We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.

The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.

&#x200B;

**The other reasons:**

The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.

$NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.

$NOK's been investing their money into R&D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.

Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.

This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.

**The biggest risk:** Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.

 

**TLDR:** 

My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about 4.75$. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait.",2021-02-02 09:20:33

The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, start of a new console cycle, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen would you say, ""Hey this company has a great future?""   I'm pretty sure most investors would.

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.

Moral of the story is JUST BUY AND HOLD and good things are in our future.",2021-02-02 09:20:28

**Equity Search** 

Equity research is a discipline within the financial services industry, in which sell-side equity research analysts produce specialized research reports for buy-side investors and corporate leaders. Equity research plays an essential role in helping investors discover market opportunities and make informed investment decisions. 

&#x200B;

*  **An equity research repor**t is a document prepared by an equity research analyst that often provides insight on whether investors should buy, hold, or sell shares of a public company. An analyst lays out their recommendation, target price, investment thesis, valuation, and risks in an equity research report. There are multiple forms of equity research, including (but not limited to): 
*  **COMPANY REPORTS** An update report that highlights the latest news, company announcements, earnings reports, Buy Sell Hold ratings, M&A activity, anything that impacts the value of the company 
*  **INITIATION REPORT**S A comprehensive company report compiled when an analyst or firm initiates their stock coverage. Initiation reports cover all of the company's divisions and products in-depth to provide a baseline of what the company is and how it is performing. Initiation reports can be tens to hundreds of pages long, depending on the complexity of a company. 

 **What is Included in a Typical Equity Research Report?**

Research reports don’t need to follow a specific formula. Analysts at different investment banks have some latitude in determining the look and feel of their reports. But more often than not, research reports follow a certain protocol of what investors expect them to look like. A typical equity research report includes in-depth industry research, management analysis, financial histories, trends, forecasting, valuations, and investors' recommendations. Sometimes called broker research reports or investment research reports, equity research reports are designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot that investors or corporate leaders can leverage to make informed decisions. 

In conclusion: You guys have to read a lot and do your own research. Make sure it is a reliable source and learn to read between the lines.

Im not a financial advisor this is mot advice. Just a detailed explanation of what i believe could be going on. This is not my words it is from an article. When i posted the link it was getting deleted so i posted the most important part


The Creation of Counterfeit Shares — There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled : Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non–counterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.


The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices, i.e. naked shorts, fails–to–deliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.


The creation of counterfeit shares falls into three general categories. Each category has a plethora of devices that are used to create counterfeit shares.
Fails–to–Deliver — If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail–to–deliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails–to–deliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below).
Since forced buy–ins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail–to–deliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails–to–deliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails–to–deliver) – which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails–to–deliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.


A major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre–SHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, “If you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.”
Only the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails–to–deliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into “legitimacy”, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails–to–deliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.


Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails–to–deliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead.
Ex–clearing counterfeiting — The second tier of counterfeiting occurs at the broker dealer level. This is called ex–clearing. Multiple tricks are utilized for the purpose of disguising naked shorts that are fails–to–deliver as disclosed shorts, which means that a share has been borrowed. They also make naked shorts “invisible” to the system so they don't become fails–to–deliver, which is the only thing the SEC tracks.
Some of the tricks are as follows:
Stock sales are either a long sale or a short sale. When a stock is transacted the broker checks the appropriate box. By mismarking the trading ticket –checking the long box when it is actually a short sale the short never shows up, unless they get caught, which doesn't happen often. The position usually gets reconciled when the short covers.
Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days, at which time a naked short should become a fail–to–deliver, however the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before the naked short gets reported as a fail–to–deliver. Most of the short hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position becoming a fail–to–deliver and is a means of quickly getting a company off of the SHO threshold list.
The prime brokers may do a buy–in of a naked short position. If they tell the short hedge fund that we are going to buy–in at 3:59 EST on Friday, the hedge fund naked shorts into their own buy–in (or has a co–conspirator do it) and rolls their position, hence circumventing Reg SHO.
Most of the large broker dealers operate internationally, so when regulators come in (they almost always “call ahead”) or compliance people come in (ditto), large naked positions are moved out of the country and returned at a later date.


The stock lend is enormously profitable for the broker dealers who charge the short sellers large fees for the “borrowed” shares, whether they are real or counterfeit. When shares are loaned to a short, they are supposed to remain with the short until he covers his position by purchasing real shares. The broker dealers do one–day lends, which enables the short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO–fail–to–deliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.


Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.


Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.
This is a sample of tactics used. For a company that is under attack, the counterfeit shares that exist at this ex–clearing tier can be ten or twenty times the number of fails–to–deliver, which is the only category tracked and policed by the SEC.


Continuous Net Settlement — The third tier of counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a holding company owned by the major broker dealers, and has four subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are of interest are the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). The DTC has an account for each broker dealer, which is further broken down to each customer of that broker dealer. These accounts are electronic entries. Ninety seven percent of the actual stock certificates are in the vault at the DTC with the DTC nominee's name on them. The NSCC processes transactions, provides the broker dealers with a central clearing source, and operates the stock borrow program.


When a broker dealer processes the sale of a short share, the broker dealer has three days to deliver a borrowed share to the purchaser and the purchaser has three days to deliver the money. In the old days, if the buyer did not receive his shares by settlement day, three days after the trade, he took his money back and undid the transaction. When the stock borrow program and electronic transfers were put in place in 1981, this all changed. At that point the NSCC guaranteed the performance of the buyers and sellers and would settle the transaction even though the seller was now a fail–to–deliver on the shares he sold. The buyer has a counterfeit share in his account, but the NSCC transacts it as if it were real.


At the end of each day, if a broker dealer has sold more shares of a given stock than he has in his account with the DTC, he borrows shares from the NSCC, who borrows them from the broker dealers who have a surplus of shares. So far it sounds like the whole system is in balance, and for any given stock the net number of shares in the DTC is equal to the number of shares issued by the company.
The short seller who has sold naked – he had no borrowed shares – can cure his fail–to–deliver position and avoid the required forced buy–in by borrowing the share through the NSCC stock borrow program.
Here is the hocus pocus that creates millions of counterfeit shares.


When a broker dealer has a net surplus of shares of any given company in his account with the DTC, only the net amount is deducted from his surplus position and put in the stock borrow program. However the broker dealer does not take a like number of shares from his customer's individual accounts. The net surplus position is loaned to a second broker dealer to cover his net deficit position.
Let's say a customer at the second broker dealer purchased shares from a naked short seller — counterfeit shares. His broker dealer “delivers” those shares to his account from the shares borrowed from the DTC. The lending broker dealer did not take the shares from any specific customers' account, but the borrowing broker dealer put the borrowed shares in specific customer's accounts. Now the customer at the second prime broker has “real” shares in his account. The problem is it's the same “real” shares that are in the customer's account at the first prime broker.
The customer account at the second prime broker now has a “real” share, which the prime broker can lend to a short who makes a short sale and delivers that share to a third party. Now there are three investors with the same counterfeit shares in their accounts.
Because the DTC stock borrow program, and the debits and credits that go back and forth between the broker dealers, only deals with the net difference, it never gets reconciled to the actual number of shares issued by the company. As long as the broker dealers don't repay the total stock borrowed and only settle their net differences, they can “grow” a company's issued stock.


This process is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) and it hides billions of counterfeit shares that never make it to the Reg. SHO radar screen, as the shares “borrowed” from the DTC are treated as a legitimate borrowed shares.
For companies that are under attack, the counterfeit shares that are created by the CNS program are thought to be ten or twenty times the disclosed fails–to–deliver, and the true CNS totals are only obtained by successfully serving the DTC with a subpoena. The SEC doesn't even get this information. The actual process is more complex and arcane than this, but the end result is accurately depicted.
Ex–clearing and CNS counterfeiting are used to create an enormous reserve of counterfeit shares. The industry refers to these as “strategic fails–to–deliver.” Most people would refer to these as a stockpile of counterfeit shares that can be used for market manipulation. One emerging company for which we have been able to get or make reasonable estimates of the total short interest, the disclosed short interest, the available stock lend and the fails–to–deliver, has fifty “buried” counterfeit shares for every fail–to–deliver share, which is the only thing that the SEC tracks, consequently the SEC has not acted on shareholder complaints that the stock is being manipulated.

The Anatomy of a Short Attack — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:
Flooding the offer side of the board — Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.


The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.


By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic fails-to-deliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will “mask” the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.


Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other “success” parameters, the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands — all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called “crashing” the stock and a successful “crash” is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash “stick” or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:
Media assault — The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately purchase real shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These real shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.


The shorts have “friendly” reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the “friendly” reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.


One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair — proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This “mistake” was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation “Due to a mathematical error” appeared three days later — after the damage was done to the stock price.
Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:
When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fictionâ€¦ you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down — it's a pretty good game.


This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports — Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned “friendly” media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.


Planting moles in target companies — The shorts plant “moles” inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.
Frivolous SEC investigations — The shorts “leak” tips to the SEC about “corporate malfeasance” by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed “confidential inquiry” is leaked to the short media.


The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.
Class Action lawsuits — Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.
Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. — If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.
Pulling margin from long customers — The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.
Paid bashers — The shorts will hire paid bashers who “invade” the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation.

This is not every dirty trick that the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

TL;DR
These funds will short sell the same shares over and over increasing the amount of “conterfeit shares” and they will use all their power to use media to divert attention from illegal activities

‘Meme Stock’ Volatility and the Real Winners,81,lah33s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lah33s/meme_stock_volatility_and_the_real_winners/,14,1612249780.0,"  

First of all, this is somewhat of a long post and I hope you all enjoy it. I hope this can start some discussion.

**Tldr:** The 'Reddit Raid' has impacted the overall economy in positive ways that we could not have predicted. We have been the lifeline that these companies needed. $AMC and $GME have benefited greatly from the rise of their common equity. **Winners: Institutional Investors, Companies, Employees, Real Estate (and local communities).**

Over the past 2 weeks we have seen retail investors from around the world making significant gains on various ‘Meme stocks’. Stocks like $GME, $AMC have seen massive price appreciation as the under-served and under-represented members of society have found a new interest in investing. News outlets continue to post sensational articles on individual people becoming rich overnight because of early investments in these companies. However, the real winners out of all of this are the companies themselves, various institutional investors, employees of these companies, and real estate companies (and local communities).

**Winners**

**Institutional Investors:**

Silver Lake Partners – Silver Lake Partners is a private equity group that up until recently, had been a credit investor with $AMC. Originally owning $600 Million worth of convertible bonds back in 2018, Silver Lake disclosed on Friday January 29th that they had converted their $600 Million worth of bonds into $AMC shares and subsequently sold those shares for a $113 Million profit. This convertible bond event also dramatically benefited $AMC through the obvious reduction in debt during a tenuous operating environment (more on that later).

$GME Shareholders – It may be a surprise to many media outlets but institutional investors have made a sizeable gain when it comes to $GME shares. Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard own 13.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of shares outstanding respectively. This has led to a gain of $2.9 Billion, $2.6 Billion, and $1.6 Billion respectively for each of these institutional investors. 

Ontario Teachers Pension Fund – The recent retail action in favour of mall REIT Macerich ($MAC) led to the largest shareholder; the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, cashing out for $500 Million which has helped boost capital available for the pension obligations of the teachers paying into this pension fund.

**Companies:**

$AMC - Due to the convertible bond action I highlighted earlier with regards to Silver Lake Partners, AMC saw an immediate reduction in the company’s debt by $600 Million dollars as the credit investor opted to take common equity instead. This reduced AMC’s debt burden and in turn has allowed them to look more favorable in the eyes of the credit market. The reduction in debt also helps AMC navigate the challenging operating environment that has been brought about by the pandemic and the restrictions. Two weeks ago, AMC was also able to raise $917 Million by tapping debt and equity markets which helped stave off concerns of bankruptcy. 

I suspect that $GME will conduct an equity offering in hopes of raising cash to pay down debt. 

These developments have been extremely beneficial to both $AMC and $GME and may have prevented bankruptcy of both businesses. At the end of the day I don’t want to see either business go under because of the compounding effects it has on the livelihoods of employees, the real estate market, and general blight on communities if in fact their brick and mortar spaces became vacant. 

**Employees:** 

$GME has 14,000 full time and 42,000 part time employees (as of 2019).

$AMC has 4,408 full time and 36,000 part time employees (as of 2018).

The survival of these companies mean that these people still have a livelihood and this avoids adding more to the already substantially high unemployment numbers nationally. 

**Real Estate:**

$GME has 5,509 brick and mortar locations.

$AMC has 1,004 brick and mortar locations.

The survival of these companies mean that real estate companies avoid large vacancies and communities avoid blighted zones of lost business.

The events of the past few weeks have been the lifeline that was needed and I hope these businesses can be turned around. Godspeed.",2021-02-02 09:09:40

I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *""powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *""Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand ""Hycan"", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

Read more [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology-301211498.html).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name ""**Project Kuiper**"". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way ""out there"". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper",2021-02-02 09:08:05

You philosophy guys may have heard of Occam’s Razor: The simplest explanation is usually correct. 

GameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is “hedge funds manipulating the price down” right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here’s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. 

It’s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it’s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. 

“But the VW chart from 09!” This isn’t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.

How did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a 💎✋🏼 meme won’t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.

This is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that’s on you and you alone. You can sell at anytime, so don’t blame others for your losses.

RIP the guy who YOLO’d at $300 today, may as well have set that money on fire. I don’t like seeing losses, I want everyone to win. But when you refuse to take profits or acknowledge a potential top, it’s on you 100% to eat the losses.

The same guys crying market manipulation now were buying SPY puts out of spite in March. Could GME have gone up more? Sure. Would SPY have crashed more without JPow in March? Probably? But guess what? What ifs don’t matter in the stock market. You trade what happens.

What’s happening to GME?,344,lagzcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagzcz/whats_happening_to_gme/,93,1612249504.0,"Credit to: u/that-possible-2402

What’s Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope",2021-02-02 09:05:04

Each of you has been given the detonator to other people's money. If you press it, you'll take your reduced gains/losses, but you'll be taking that from another retard, not the hedge funds.

That's where I'm noticing people are at right now. I've been tracking emotional sentiment across many spam channels and communities, and from what I've seen, traction is slowing down and the big question ""Do we sell and take our loss?"" is coming up. I guarantee there are a lot of people who would stand in solidarity and/or lie just to keep the mob going. That's how Prisoner's Dilemma works. MANY of you are still diamond hands and I commend your valor, but we need to rally the soldiers who don't have that kind of gumption. We need to stand united. Praise u/deepfuckingvalue for staying in the trade fully.

# Most Important Part is this paragraph:

Let me explain the Prisoner's Dilemma: 3 people are arrested. Those 3 people are then questioned individually, but the cops have nothing on them so if they can't get a confession, they all walk free. To try and intimidate them, they tell them if they rat out their friends, they can walk free, but if their friend rats them out first, they won't get that deal. ""Do you really trust your friend not to rat you out?"" All it takes is solidarity and all 3 walk away and win. But, if one person breaks and rats them out for selfish gains, then the whole thing breaks down.

You and I, and everyone, all knew coming into this it was a boom or bust trade. The noobies expected immediate returns and are the ones risking the integrity of this play. But we can still prevail. We just have to not rat out our fellow autists to the hedge funds.

If you overextended yourself and are about to lose your rent money, we understand. We'll buy your shares back. But, remember, we always knew this could zero out and it's important to show your solidarity, because without it, this is over.

We know the hedge funds are cheating, manipulating media, acting corruptly, and showing their true colors. That means we are winning. They wouldn't need these tactics otherwise. They had the whole weekend to come up with a new strategy to dwindle our resolve and to be honest, I can see that it's having an effect on some of you. We just got mortared something fierce and we're stuck in the trenches with our ears ringing. That doesn't mean the battle is lost.

Rest assured that the majority of us are NOT selling and if you are in, all you have to do is **hold.**

This is a test of human nature. Will you be selfless or selfish? Will you trust in your fellow retard or turncoat and run away? Now you show your true nature.

GIVE THEM NOTHING, BUT TAKE FROM THEM, EVERYTHING.

Forgot to say this is not financial advice. I just like the stock :).

Edit: Added this supply/demand chart from u/Davscozal: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml) \- If more green than red, then we're winning. Price decreases are false. This is basic supply/demand. Price does not go down when you have more demand (green) than supply (red), but it did anyway.

Alright autists, put down your pitchforks and stop raging at Robinhood and read about the next moonshot for 5 min...

TLDR for you retards who don’t have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.

**Summary** 🚀🚀

XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.

**The players**🚀🚀

Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.

Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.

Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.

**Application**🚀🚀

The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here’s how:

- XL’s hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.

- Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.

- XL grid is XL’s charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites. 

These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.

** Other Info**🚀🚀

- On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine

- Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola. 

- The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a “Buy America” executive order that creates new guidelines for the government’s $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity

🚀🚀- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 🚀🚀

**TLDR**

XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we’ve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri. 

Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, but do so with XL fleet in mind.  

Giraffe out.

Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c

But hear me out. 

If the media posts about WSB being in silver trying to pull a gamestop, but WSB says that they're not in silver and that it's fake news, why did the price go up today? The answer seems pretty straightforward. You guys rocked the world with $GME and the rest of the world is hungry for some action. If WSB didn't push silver up today, it must have been all of the average people watching the news that missed $GME and want to catch the next wave. Why would this buying stop? 

I can't imagine a single scenario where silver doesn't go up. It's just a matter of time.

What happens when your order goes through and you get your shares? The broker/market maker needs to offset that position to ensure liquidity in the market. So what do they do? They buy the opposite direction - a ""hedge""

What does this mean with GME right now? Well, all the share are gone, this is quite well known. So, while we are buying calls and shares into the dips, it's enabling the sale of shorts and buying of puts to hedge the positions. But what if......

You begin to buy LONG DATED AT OR IN THE MONEY put options? Well, the market makers have to hedge against that too....by buying shares. They have to have the shares for you to sell to the other side of those contracts. Shares that don't exist anywhere because they're all being held by us. Why long-dated? Because if they think the option contracts won't be in the money in time they just ignore them, but long dated contracts carry more time risk so they hedge them.

Right now we are fighting a battle by using strength against strength, but if we use their own strength against them....They are fucked.

&#x200B;

First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments.

I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week. A lot more than normal. And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here. So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose. Short, long, whatever. It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife. Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money.

And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.

To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation. I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else. What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.

So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath. It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance. It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop):

>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.  
>  
>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1  
>  
>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)  
>  
>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.  
>  
>What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”

So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.

**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  
You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened. You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices. You simply don't know. You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.

This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks. You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it. Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.

**Emotions** The problem with this whole ""strike back at wall street"" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade. Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt. This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars. So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending.

Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet. But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.

TLDR:

1. know and understand who is playing this game. And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not. You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner.
2. Short squeezes end fast. As fast as they started. If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.
3. Get your emotions out of play here. This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes. Can't handle that? then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.

Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole ""fight the hedge funds"" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back. If that's worth it to you then have at it. But don't fool yourself in to thinking otherwise.",2021-02-02 08:59:44

Why Things Are Still Looking Good: FUTURE CATALYSTS AND OUTLOOK,1114,lagsgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagsgk/why_things_are_still_looking_good_future/,127,1612249010.0,"Let's be real, some of you are sounding like desperate fucks. You don't need to convince anybody to hold their shares; have confidence and hold strong, here is why:

Today we shook all of the paper hands. I repeat: TODAY WE SHOOK ALL OF THE PAPER HANDS. Every single mf holding the stock has💎 **diamond**  💎 hands and will not sell. **DFV is still in**, I'm still in, we are STILL IN. We have created a moat.

Potential upcoming catalysts:

* Potential announcements from gamestop regarding their outlook and business plans
* More celebrity shoutouts and support by the day.
* ITM calls from friday must be settled tomorrow at the latest
* Legal developments (ie SEC involvement, congressional hearings)
* More people realizing silver is a fucking scam.
* WSB subscribers up to 8 million (was 6-7 million last week) and continuing to rise this week.
* Official/reliable government short data released feb 9 or something

&#x200B;

**Addressing doubts:**

* According to some sources, the short percentage has dropped:

We don't know the actual short percentage. All numbers we have are estimates, which can easily be manipulated by shorters with various tactics (using options, etc) or methodology changes (not accounting synthetic longs, etc). Even if we do accept the data from S3, the short squeeze thesis is not contested or done-- as long as people hold the shorts still lose money whether they have an absurdly pants-on-fire high amount, or a lower but still insanely high amount. The true ""float"" of shares gets lower and lower as more and more diamond hands enter at dips. It is even possible to short squeeze at 10% (and lower) if nobody sells and buying ramps up due to some catalysts. Keep in mind they could add more shorts today or at any time if they believe we are losing momentum.

&#x200B;

* What if the whales rug pull us? (or some shady under-the-table deal, etc)

&#x200B;

The whales want to make money too, and they make the most money off of volatility and GME staying high and popular. They have the retail data, they read wsb. They know you fucks ain't selling. If they wanted us to tank the price would already be 40. They would never let short sellers off the hoo knowing they could squeeze them dry.

&#x200B;

* What if shorts never give up and continue to lower the price?

I don't know about you but I believe in the stubbornness of our community of apes (which lose nothing from holding) more than hedge funds which are losing money daily. They don't want to tie up capital on losing trades for such an extended period of time.

&#x200B;

* ""Veterans"" and people with ""concerns""

Likely holding puts or have no better idea wtf is happening than you do. What do they hope they accomplish with these ""concerns""? Are they helping you by trying to spark a panic sell?

&#x200B;

Welcome people's doubts with open arms and offer your rebuttals: our community has a diamond will.

These are just my dumb thoughts, godspeed apes.

WE ARE ACTUALLY FUCKING CRUSHING IT.

It’s genuinely incredible. And it deserves to be said. It is *astounding* the uniform resolve people are showing right now.

The price action today is complete bullshit, short ladder attacks mostly. And we are getting to the end of their bag of tricks. 

I’m not even worried anymore, and I almost never trust crowds. But when you look at the volume you see that we are overwhelmingly DIAMOND HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

Y’all have amazed and inspired me. I am going to sleep well.

Europoor reporting for duty. Am french retard^é, can't even speak proper english, i'm just a simpleton having wet dreams of retiring early. The following is a chaotic series of bad metaphors because I like images, that's what I do. 
Mods : Second time trying to post this, i'm a Reddit veteran with a 9 years account. Mostly a lurker but I want to help with this new found wrinkle on my smooth brain.
This is not a financial advice, do your own DD and know your risk tolerance, especially in these wild times.*

Before reading my take on the subject, [please go read u/johnnydaggers take before. It's the most interesting thing I've read this week-end](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)


💎 **STATUS QUO** 💎


In a game of musical chairs slowing down because of a drying liquidity, both parties may be stuck for a while in an inconfortable position. Shorts are experiencing a slow burn paying interests for their borrowed shares and Longs might feel discouraged with a sense of injustice turning odds against them (especially retail investors).
The problem is, paid interests are marginal (millions) when that could be much much worse with an ever increasing percentage of longs which has been quite halted since last Thursday. Shorts are then playing against the clock hoping for some backup by the SEC simply freezing the trade of $GME for ten days or more, killing momentum and scaring people away --> papers hands flying in the eye of the storm. 

What can we do other than buying more shares and holding? Most of us are out of ammo and holding has its limitations too. We've gone a long way, me might have already landed in the moon unknowingly but I know we all aim for more.
But lets be realistic for a second, we've just invaded Dirty Money People playground and they know every corner of it. We may be in a strong position regarding $GME, but we don't drive the narrative for the remaining 99.99% of the stock market. Shorts still can make big bucks elsewhere, even though they have to liquidate their assets to fund our Nintendos, Teslas, dildo shaped rockets to effing Mars, etc. 

SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Yes we already know.
SHORTED SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Ok we know that too, they *only* have interests to pay.


💎 **NOT JET FUEL BUT OUT OF THIS WORLD NUCLEAR BLAST TYPE FUEL** 💎


What do we do to **FORCE** them to buy those shares NEXT WEEK?
What has always been our weapon of choice?
Last week we were too much focused on owning our shares and holding that we collectively agreed that options were not the best way to trigger the MOASS. The plan was followed religiously and that's still an advantage.


💎 **What my only wrinkle whispered to me while in bed this morning** 💎

⠀
As you retards already now, ITM options can be exercised for shares : 100xcontracts you own.
Meaning, past the expiration date, those shares HAVE TO be bought within the following week and given to you lucky retards.
Unfortunately, right now, one single of those safe contract cost so much that most of us can't afford it anymore.
*Wrote this half assed DD this morning and it seems like options buying has been made difficult in several brokerages, meaning they don't want us to go this way...*

NOW we need bigger fishes to light a fire so hot Shorts would not have time to lose their shirts but cook instantly! We need rich kids and mad billionaires!

IF we collectively hold and harden our diamonds hands even more in this week to come, and have rich troopers coming to buy every single deep ITM and ITM calls there is, next week is going to trigger the biggest chain reaction and propel us so fast that we could attain light speed in a snap and reach $69,420.69 ☮️


💎 **PAPA MUSK, if you are reading this poorly made DD, don't buy shares, buy far ITM options to force their hands and make us 0.001% as rich as you!! I'll definitely buy a Tesla if it goes higher than $6000** 💎


Thanks for your consideration. I don't know what I've just wrote down. I'm ape. I like bananas and I like $GME for sure.


💎 POSITIONS : 175 shares @ $65 av 💎
