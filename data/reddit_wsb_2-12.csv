I think I might of read they are needed in the inverters to convert DC battery power to AC power needed for the motor. Would this just be silicon/germanium transistors?

I know there's also been a shortage of semiconductors used to make high end video cards, although im not sure if this is the same thing affecting the EV industry.

Yeah see I’m stupid 

Now that you know I’m retarded let’s look at what’s happened the past month. The entire country got together and was on the GME train. 
Could we control the market? Nope, not even fucking close. Did we learn our lesson? No, we are stupid as shit.

This my theory of weed stock. Someone please hop in and tell me to fuck off if I’m wrong but in my opinion they sucked us in. On Wednesday’s pre market weed stonks were🚀🚀🚀🚀, market opened, everyone bought at ATH....then rocket ship crashed. Around noon time everything seemed to recover and all is good. 

Okay so today, (Thursday) pre market was up everything was looking great! However we all learned are lesson!! Market will open, things will dip and THEN we buy because Stonks only go up!! Only today we got played and rocket ship kept plummeting. Maybe it was intentional and maybe it wasn’t but if I was on their shoes I’d be looking for ways to control us retards as well.

If you still think we pull the strings and you think you’re going to sit on your shitty little iPhone, make a couple Reddit posts with rocket ships and outplay people who do this for a living go get therapy or pound your head against your shitty Honda Civic. 

They prey on us, they don’t give a fuck. If you’re up 200% on something why the fuck would you hold. If someone gave you $200 are you going to sit there and wait for more??? Probably because you’re a brainless ape.

Also if someone wants to explain this day trade limit thing to me and why it’s in place pls let me know. Shouldn’t it be the opposite so the smaller fish can protect themselves than these big hedge funds being able to control the market with a few clicky clickies.

Remember when $PTON was trading in the $20s? Let me remind you... There was this flashy exercise bike company that thought they would take the home gym market by storm. It was slow, but then the pandemic hit. There was a huge shift to home gyms and $PTON crushed earnings in May 2020. Their stock rocketed to $43 and the rest is history.

I am happy to say that the $PTON rocket to $43 in May 2020 is where we are today with $SONO.

$SONO just reported earnings ($1.17 EPS) that beat estimates ($.88 EPS). Along with that, they raised their 2021 revenue ($1.6b) and earnings targets -

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sonos-easily-tops-revenue-estimates-as-pandemic-fuels-continued-boom-in-speaker-sales-11612991269?siteid=yhoof2)

But back to why this makes sense from a trend perspective. First off, $SONO has industry leading sound quality for home audio. I own it. It is amazing. The reason I bought it was, after a long search, they were the only true wireless surround sound (and full home audio) company out there. Their tech is very far ahead of their competitors and it shows with constant growth in revenue.

But, the main trend... Warner Bros is releasing blockbusters to HBO Max the same day as theaters, Netflix subscriptions are up, Disney is releasing movies same day to Disney+, streaming services are popping up left and right... AMC and other theaters are HURTING and might not hold on. There is a massive shift to in-home theaters and $SONO dominates when it comes to in-home audio.

In the future, they will partner with some fancy new EV company for in-car audio. They have plans to do that.

Anyway, I see $SONO going to $70 by EOY.

Positions -

6 3/19 $40c

33 7/16 $45c

3 shares @ $36.06

TLDR - Buy $SONO. Trend to in-home theater and audio is just beginning to be noticed. Lagged the in-home gym trend, but is a bigger market. $SONO is the industry-leader in performance and only true full-home wireless audio company out there. In-car audio coming soon. $70 EOY PT.

Not amazing but a respectable 20-30% bull run a week. 

I have some research and DD done for them but a bit hesitant to even say the ticker name because of the absolute state of the sub. 

I think what happened was a mix of different kinds of people after the GME conflict. Many new users have never seen gain bigger than .04% in their chase savings account, so for them, a gain of 10-20% is absolutely massive and will get out as soon as they realize that gain because “10% is a once in a life time” for them. 

Of course this leads to the conflict with the old retards that want to see 10,000% in the call options. And the new will alway win because it’s about 4m to 2m in number here in this sub. 

This is not investments. This is a get rich quick scheme. I think this is what’s not being understood by the newer people and what the older people don’t understand about new people. New people treat this sub as investment, gaining 10-20% a day is absolutely amazing. So they take profit and buy dip. Etc. nothing wrong with that. 

I also would like to venture that there are definitely hedgfunds (not large but small ones) that have started to ride our the momentum for short term for stocks in this sub. The massive volume in premarket is the first realization of this (I know most of you old retards don’t use anything like actual trading platform beside robinhood so you’re stuck with market days only and I’m guessing 99% of the new retards don’t even know you CAN trade AF and pre market).",2021-02-12 02:49:08

AMC - THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER!,387,li8wkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li8wkn/amc_the_fight_is_not_over/,111,1613156638.0,"A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.

What's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?

No.

AMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.

This, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance - i.e. FUD.

The number one rule of marketing is ""never create high expectations that you cannot meet"". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.

Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.

Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.

With all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?

Utilization rate was 91.4% on the 8th of February:

And has since dropped to 88.4%, which is still quite high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98vvwidh31h61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=743a2c23504fc1414b8a7e234d32274a4083a1d6

What this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from 81.7m to 82.3m.

This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.

What else do we know?

We now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is 87.5%!!!!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ew7hb2i31h61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=16392e7dc6020f44715041681e16bb374d8d8dff

**Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):**

The short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.

So hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.

Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:

Vanguard - 55.46% increase worth, I dunno but they have bought 2.7M new shares.

Blackrock - 69% increase worth $13.17M

Northern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $2.12M

And many more who bought into the stock recently:

We're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them **""This stock is hard to borrow"".**

**Such as Etrade:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xj13u0ck31h61.jpg?width=566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e443aa0ce20eb70bf67584db89ba4950b54f5ee

Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4.5%.

Another report from NakedShortReport

shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9151j3io31h61.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f7e43c8e61ec57990b88419c777ad2fe842ae8

Naked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.

**CONCLUSION**

What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.

Don't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.

This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.

Invest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.

**For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.** However, this is no guarantee, obviously.

Take everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.

**Let me know what you think!**

Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics, anti depressants ssris, mood suppressors, maois, anti anxiety medication, benzos, addiction medication, and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies, and then bought into the big pharma borg. 

The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didn’t return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success. 

The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit 6.8 billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom.

GME historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events,650,lhyumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhyumr/gme_historical_survey_of_the_systemic_problem_of/,109,1613117541.0,"Full disclosure, stolen from r/options.

A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME
TLDR: Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)
I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:
One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs (https://wherearetheshares.com/). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here /r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.
I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm. “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. A fail may also result from “naked” short selling.”
Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.
According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities. Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price. (Source: https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm)
In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.” Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “a tool to drive down a company's stock price"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote /r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm)
As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008 https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm)
I also read ‘One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and artificially depressing the share price’”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"".

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.
On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.
Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars (https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.
Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices.” (Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720).
""It has been alleged in tens or hundreds of lawsuits that the DTCC and its Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading. (Source: https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/)
As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.
From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.” (source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314

GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs (/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close

As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float

The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares

Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME

There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Also, a compelling theory put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read",2021-02-12 10:12:21

A good value w/ div all while screwing the massive shorts! $RYCEY,115,li7wjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li7wjo/a_good_value_w_div_all_while_screwing_the_massive/,162,1613152066.0,"You might need to be patient but I feel this is one of the safer plays mentioned here. It's currently just riding above the $1.30 support. Yes they had a hard year  last year as well as about every other aviation related company. The vaccine is slowly being deployed and airline traffic is already up substantially since mid-year.

Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation. This adds to the deals with the UK space energy and Virgin Galactic. Big success is around the corner.

Further, the company continues to expect to turn cash flow positive at some point during second quarter fiscal 2021, target at least 750 million free cash flow as early as 2022 and at least 2 billion pounds from disposal proceeds. In the 11-month period to ending November, large engine LTSA invoiced flying hours or EFH were approximately 42% of their prior year level. In October and November combined, EFH increased to approximately 33% compared to 2019. In the third quarter, EFH were 29% of the prior year, an improvement versus the 24% seen in Q2.

Not even mentioning 16,000 military engines with 160 customers in 103 different countries (war is always inevitable). Mix that with the fact that Brexit is official and you have a company that is desperately needed and will surely be the benefactor of a sweetheart deal by the government.

&#x200B;

I'm adding this because a post I saw earlier that I agree with very much, the shorts are absolutely trashing RYCEY and this company deserves to get back to normal. Their debt issues could be helped if we help them by screwing the shorts. The short $ is insane and they need to learn another lesson.

The ceiling is so much higher than the floor in this situation. Here is just added info for those who want it.

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-12-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to log another positive week

> * U.S. stock futures fell Friday, one day after a mixed session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average dip slightly from its previous record high close, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out new record high closes. All three stock benchmarks were tracking for their second straight positive week, in a continuation of February’s strength. So far this month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased 4.8%, 5.4% and 7.3%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 broke two-month winning streaks in January, while the Nasdaq rose for a fourth month in a row in January.

*****

> # 2. Booming Disney+ helps to offset theme park slump

> * Shares of Disney rose about 2% in premarket trading after the company reported an adjusted fiscal first-quarter profit of 32 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 41 cents per share. Revenue fell 22% to $16.25 billion from a year earlier, though it did beat estimates. Due to Covid, Disney saw a slump in theme park attendance and box office results, but the success of its streaming video service continued. Disney+ added more than 21 million subscribers during the quarter for a total of 94.9 million.

*****

> # 3. White House to address travel, education concerns

> * Major airline CEOs are scheduled to meet virtually Friday with the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, according to Reuters. The meeting comes as airlines, unions and industry groups strongly object to the possibility of requiring predeparture Covid testing for domestic flights.
The CDC plans to issue new guidelines Friday on how to reopen U.S. schools as safely as possible. Pressure to reopen or expand in-person learning has been building for months as students and parents tire of remote classes. Reopening schools is a top priority for the Biden administration.

*****

> # 4. U.S. secures 200 million more Covid vaccine doses

> * The White House secured deals for 100 million additional doses of Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and 100 million more of Moderna’s. During Thursday’s tour of the National Institutes of Health, President Joe Biden said the U.S. will have now enough supply of the two-shot vaccines to inoculate 300 million Americans by the end of July. Biden is trying to pick up the pace of vaccinations after a slower-than-expected rollout under former President Donald Trump. Roughly 34.7 million out of some 331 million Americans have received at least their first dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.

SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING!,3422,liaygp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/,858,1613165088.0,"Hi, I have been lurking here for a while now. Recently I began reading WSB more, commenting, etc, because it helps numb the pain of my losses and adds some good laughs. My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of ""investing"", I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I'd always think let's enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I'd want to cash out a bit. This isn't even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. 

I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn't rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???

If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren't actually allowed to make money?

EDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!

EDIT: Thank you for the Awards and Karma, I have no idea what it is but hey atleast some numbers went up for once!",2021-02-12 23:24:48
I’ll never make enough own a Tesla. What I want is much more retarded. I’m just not retarded enough to do it.,43,liaye1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaye1/ill_never_make_enough_own_a_tesla_what_i_want_is/,64,1613165081.0,"I might be retarded, or deranged. Not sure yet.

A few years back real life stopped being good and I sold off my fun account to get through the hard times. There was the divorce due to my wife’s boyfriend (no joke). Then came my dog’s surgery... before the TSLA split. Tsla paid for it so I can’t complain.

My issue is that I’m consistently making boomer plays now and I can’t help myself. Last year things stopped making sense to me, and the stuff that did make sense didn’t pan out... thanks PCG. The stuff that didn’t make sense exploded. Hertz...? But, again and again, this sub called it. I just didn’t see it.

Help me make sense of what happening so I can buy my unicorn with my fun account a ride to Xanadu.

My unicorn is not a Cyber Truck. I’ll never make that kind of money.

What I want is a van. A very specific, ugly van. A van that I can get my old motorcycle into and go cross country and forget the troubles of the past few years.

The unicorn:

https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/4711175038924333/?ref=search&referral_code=undefined

So, here’s my thesis...

I think people that made their GME millions in these risky plays will be looking for Boomer plays now that they are done gambling.

I also think the market, now, functions like a voting system where individual traders are investing in what they want the new world to look like, not what is exactly the best investment.

Here are my plays.

I think PCG goes to $20/ share in the expectation of a dividend in 2023. That might be in 2022... too far out. (yes... I am too boomer to understand this is not a good idea). I had a few 2023/$10 calls, but, I used the gains for a vasectomy. (Worth it)

I think STWD recovers. They’re a REIT with a 10% dividend. And they’re still down with $6 to go prior to reaching where they were prior to COVID.

SENS (handful of shares), IDEX (probably a bad idea to have shares), And a handful of penny stocks. All of these plays are up 100%.


Have a completely past the rubicon and ventured into boomer territory? Is this it - no going back? Should I just dump my little fun account into vanguard too, give up and make the safe plays? How do you risk it all for your dreams again once you get old?",2021-02-12 23:24:41
$600M in inflows to UVXY in the past 4 days. Is this a big hedge or a big short position?,78,liaxu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaxu1/600m_in_inflows_to_uvxy_in_the_past_4_days_is/,96,1613165024.0,"Sauce: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/proshares-ultra-vix-short-term-futures-daily-inflows-129-8-mln

UVXY has added more than $600 million of new money in less than a week even as the volatility ETF has fallen to 1-year lows. 

Short interest in UVXY has also gone to its highest level since March. This either means more people are hedging at market highs or that institutions are buying shares in order to short it. 

This means that it could be either an extremely bearish signal or an extremely bullish signal. While this is about the level UVXY was at before the big correction last year, the short interest could also mean a lot of volatility is about to come off the market. 

This is also a measurement of 1-month VIX futures, meaning that the bet is on the move happening over the very short term. Is anyone else playing this or using it to hedge?",2021-02-12 23:23:44

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) **- Advanced Mooning Devices** 🚀 have gained +12.8% over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of +28.7%. Business is good.

*The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.* 

If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' & 'why is my pp small'? 

Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $3.24 billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%. **For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $3.2 billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.** 

*Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...*

AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.

Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa ""Su Bae"" pointed out on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) that the supply constraints were in the ""low end of the PC market."" AKA nothing to worry about.

So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([**TSM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window. 

Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

TLDR:

Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing? Specific recommendations inside,1362,li9jtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li9jtm/shroom_stocks_are_they_really_the_next_big_thing/,524,1613159572.0,"The short version: Shroom stocks have huge upside, due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high (loads of studies quoted to back it up) + ongoing approval of many psilocybin-based pharmaceutical drugs in North America + current administration making decriminalization easier. Several psychedelic mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

3 parts to this DD:

1. The science - why psychedelic mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products.
2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as pharmaceutical drugs
3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions

**My core thesis:** Psychedelic mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire psychedelic sector up.

**1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS**

The evidence behind the effectiveness of psychedelics for various health conditions is piling up.

Harvard University: ""the study authors and the commentators — who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber — recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens"" - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/Reviving\_the\_study\_of\_hallucinogens](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Reviving_the_study_of_hallucinogens)

Pharmacognosy Review: ""They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/)

3 Biotech Journal: ""This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/)

DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given “breakthrough therapy” designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).

Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/)

Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396)

A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513)

SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.

**2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION**

Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.

I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.

However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.

Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.

And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.

According to [thekit.ca](https://thekit.ca) \- In Canada, ""The process is well on its way. In August 2020, federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end-of-life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness. (Fifty-three-year-old Laurie Brooks, who has colon cancer, was one of them—read her story next in our Psychedelics Now series). Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased.""

In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.

As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received ""breakthrough therapy"" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.

This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.

SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.

**3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS**

Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stock do I recommend?

1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too.
2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment. Probably has the biggest upside potential.

There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted this stock for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.

My position:

* 100 shares of $CMPS @ $50
* 1200 shares of $MMEDF @ $3.7

Usual disclaimers: There's no guarantee of anything ever, and most morons who invest end up losing money. Sorry pal.",2021-02-12 21:52:52

Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.

***Shitty Corporate Governance:***

I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.

People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with ""only"" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's ""owner"" controls the entire conglomerate with a 3.4% ownership stake.

[This is Samsung Group's Ownership Structure](https://preview.redd.it/jqvamel8m0h61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dbc7133b7a239b7f90b8c56787791b3ebf9461)

***Circular Holdings:***

A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.

The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.

***Prices Held Down:***

Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.

The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.

**tl;dr:**

Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is ""they're cheap"". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time.",2021-02-12 19:44:01
BB/AMZN Speculation Part 2: Forget cars. It's was all about the drones from the start.,425,li6gf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li6gf1/bbamzn_speculation_part_2_forget_cars_its_was_all/,75,1613144925.0,"In case you missed it: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/) of my speculation on why I think BB/AMZN are not-so-secretly working together on drones. 

TLDR: AWS's CEO will become Amazon's CEO, and together with JC he will make Futurama-esque air traffic a reality in the near future via AWS IOT and QNX/IVY.

Okay first things first. To dispel the notion that ""bLacKbErRy QnX iS foR caRS And iT haS notHinG to Do wITH DronES"" see: [https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/) Literally the very first image on that page is a drone. QNX isn't just for cars. It's for all things autonomous including cars, trucks, evtols, drones, minority report spider bots, you name it.

Secondly, with regards to those who claim that ""Amazon can just program their own drones"" and thus has no need for BlackBerry, I implore you to check out BB's trove of Government certifications (link [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications)) and 40000+ patents (link [https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/](https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/)). 

With that out of the way, let's talk D-R-O-N-E-S

Here are a few more supporting evidence for my hypothesis:

December 2013 - Bezos reveals Amazon Prime Air, a R&D project to deliver parcels with ""octocopters"" He suggested it would be \~5 years or so before it is available to consumers. [LINK](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/) Well, it's been 7 years now so we are already 2+ years behind schedule.

December 18, 2015 - Amazon file for patents pertaining to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (LINK at bottom)

December 18, 2015 - AWS IOT (Internet of Things) launches [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-now-generally-available/)

>""We built IoT Core because connected devices are proliferating. They are in your house, your car, your office, your school, and perhaps even in your body! Like some of our more advanced customers, we have been building systems around connected devices for quite some time. **Our experience with** [**Amazon Robotics**](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/)**, drones (**[**Amazon Prime Air**](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011)**)**, the [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/echo), the [Dash Button](http://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button), and multiple generations of [Kindles](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle) has given us a well-informed perspective on how to serve this really important emerging market""

Is it reaching to suggest that Amazon very much had DRONES on their minds when they started AWS IOT on the same day the filed for UAV patents? Take a look at this [picture](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-MY-sGfWtWNrFljWJj01HIzWM34=/0x0:811x612/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:811x612):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8738261/drone_interior.png) to get an idea of what Amazon had in mind.

Fast forward to 2020

In Jan 2020, AWS announced a collaboration with BlackBerry:

>""The platform will integrate the BlackBerry QNX operating system and over-the-air software update services, with **AWS IoT** cloud services for secure connectivity and telematics, Amazon SageMaker for developing ML models, and **AWS IoT** edge services for in-vehicle ML inference.""

Alright, so the purpose of this partnership is ""secure connectivity"", ""telematics (monitoring of vehicle)"" and ""ML (machine learning)"".. nothing that specifically points to drones yet

In June 2020, BlackBerry partners with DeDrone (a leader in airspace security):

>""New advanced technologies have the potential to solve some of today’s most pressing challenges, however, they also introduce new security risks,” said Christoph Erdmann, Senior Vice President of Secure Communications, BlackBerry. “**Drones are one of the many IoT endpoints that add to the growing chaos that security leaders must navigate.** We’re excited to partner with Dedrone to offer a critical solution that organizations around the world can use to keep citizens and the public safe.”

Drones. Security. IoT. 5 months after Amazon and BlackBerry began their collaboration.

In September 2020, Amazon Drone Fleet receives FAA approval. Did BB have anything to do with it? Maybe, maybe not.

Alright, so let's pretend that you subscribe to this hypothesis that BB had a hand in Amazon's drone project. So what? BFD, right? How many drones are we even talking about? 20000? 50000?

Amazon delivers \~3 billion packages a year globally. Drones are by far the cheapest option for last mile delivery (contrast that with a dude wear khaki shorts driving a 2 ton truck from the Amazon fulfillment center to your condo) so it's no stretch to suggest that it will be Amazon's preferred method of delivery like 99%+ of the time. No, a drone isn't going to fly all the way from Seattle, Washington to your porch in Blaine.. but an autonomous truck might take your parcel from Seattle to Blaine and let a drone complete the rest of the journey. Or something. 

3 billion deliveries divided by 365  = 8.219 million deliveries per day. Even if drones can deliver packages to you in 30 minutes on average (60 min round trip) and worked around the clock with no need for recharging or maintenance, it would take 342465 drones. That's 342465 unmanned flying vehicles collecting flight data for IVY. 

I'm gonna stop myself here before this completely devolves into JC/Jassy fan fiction. The whole point of this coke bender DD is to suggest that BB's potential isn't merely ""OS for Cars."" In fact, cars only account for 175 million out of Blackberry's 500 million IOT endpoints. 

We're talking about drones, flying taxis, robots, roombas, fighter jets, tanks, and yes, EVs too. Essentially, anything that MOVES and CAN POTENTIALLY BE HACKED = $$$ for BB. I wager that there will be plenty of things in the future which fall into both of those categories.

Position: a modest amount of BB shares.

SKM undervalued. I like the stock,0,li6scx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li6scx/skm_undervalued_i_like_the_stock/,25,1613146505.0,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.

SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd.

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

"I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic",3519,li5vch,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/,1111,1613142123.0," [Read Only Version of Google Sheet for Comparing Daily Price Change With Multiple Markets' Short Volume](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emNB6-oMHNk42IaHpJ-67i5PL-Dg2OFblIp50zTH3PI/edit?usp=sharing)   \- Go Nuts Everyone!

&#x200B;

Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say ""OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE"" but I noticed something from another ""penny stock"" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

**Edit 2:** Was asked to see how my ""theory"" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:

**Edit 3:**  BoatyMcBoatFace -4:30am 16% !!! 5am -13%, 9am -20%, 9:25am -13%, **10:30am -18%, Noon - 15%, 1pm - 15%, 2:45pm - 14%**

**Edit 4:** WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.

**Edit 5:** FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.

Few lessons:
1) At the end of the day it’s every man for himself in the markets. No one is going to care for you if you go broke we are not privileged like Melvin. 

2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price. If the answer is yes hold, if no sell. 

2.5) find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify

3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top. 

4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet. Not fucking OTM weekly FDs

2. Anger - These POS Hedgefund bullies, forever taking our piece of the pie. Where's the fairness in all of this? Where is God? Why is this happening?  

3. Barganining -  What if AMC become digital? What if AMC is purchased by Amazon or Netflix? Errr post pandemic we will see movie theatres open again and it will rise, everyone loves the cinema. Also.....sHoRt LaDdEr aTacKS

Why Yandex (YNDX) is poised for optimal growth and massive expansion,208,li2pnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li2pnz/why_yandex_yndx_is_poised_for_optimal_growth_and/,124,1613129756.0,"I'm going to cut to the chase because I know most of you are on the verge of bankruptcy at age 19 because you got in at $450 on GME and wondering why its not going to $1000 after you paper handed at $439 and sold.

&#x200B;

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

&#x200B;

# But first, fundamentals.

This is to help you sleep better at night so you can worry more about your 35c 2/19 AMC calls you blew your money into.

I don't like re-inventing a lot of stuff so this is simply principles I've adopted from Grand-Daddy Graham

**Adequate size (sales no less than 700m)**

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?

Check the 2018 & 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else? **They currently have enough cash (1.1b$) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.**

In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have **is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.**

This tells me they're not gonna lay down like a bitch and cry to daddy when a white swan curve ball is thrown at them (I'm looking at you airlines)

This is their free cash flow from previous 3 years and TTM. You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m

# Now, on to some of their services.

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Market**

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. ""Delivery with a click"" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Alice**

Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.

To all my Peak Freak Apes - there is one major reason to not let out of your SNDL position just yet,229,li26ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li26ar/to_all_my_peak_freak_apes_there_is_one_major/,177,1613127981.0,"So the market corrected today. There has been a ton of press in the last 72 hours about how Sundial is an inflated stock and that no doubt had an effect on the market today. That, and, if we are being frank, the stock was probably a bit overvalued given the lack of DD that actually caused it rise.

But let's pause right there and take a minute to discuss value. Value, some may argue, is only held intrinsically. However, the reality is that value is always set by the buyer. The market is driven by market psychology. The point here is that no matter what reason SNDL gained over the last two weeks, the value was there. For those of us who bought and and have gains, and those of us who bought and are holding the bag right now -- the fact of the matter is for a period of time the value of this stock had increased. We ourselves saw the higher value in it, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it at the price we did, now would we have? Whether a rise in value is due to the company experiencing a catalyzing event, or because a bunch of retarded apes like flinging their own shit around, it doesn't really matter - the value went up.

Now, I only paused for that brief aside because I want to tell my fellow apes - stop being peak freaks. A day of correction isn't the end of the world. The fact of the matter is, this stock may have been overvalued at $4, but at under a dollar it was drastically undervalued given the ""money moves"" they have been making in the last 10 months.

Now, segue into the point of all this. Due to the rise in value over the last 9 days of SNDL, regardless of what caused that rise, SNDL has made it into the territory of becoming compliant. 9 consecutive days of over $1 and tomorrow is day 10. What does this mean? It means the stock, having been in jeopardy of being delisted from Nasdaq ever since it transferred to the exchange, lost investor interest. Now, with a 10 day consecutive period trading over $1, the stock will be no longer be in jeopardy of being delisted (at least for 90 more days). The Big takeaway here is this: SINCE $SNDL WAS LISTED ON NASDAQ, IT HAS \*NEVER\* REACHED THIS COMPLIANCE THRESHOLD. Since day 1 it has literally been fighting to stay on NASDAQ. Now, in all likelihood, it is going to get to stay. This will likely serve as a catalyst event to boost the stock short term.

I am not saying this stock is destined to go back to $4, but if you are down today and want to let your shares grow and then go for the profit take, the opportunity has not disappeared.

&#x200B;

TL;DR $SNDL gets NASDAQ compliance tomorrow and then we should anticipate a bump of some sort in the price due to the new-founded exposure.

Basically in the article is says there is a monopoly of a few players (Bayer, Corteva, ChemChina and BASF) controlling the entire agriculture sector and they decide for the farmers what tractor they should buy and they dictate the farmers what to grow and how. Supply chains are also very short and that means things could break very quickly, is this why we also see mass farmer protests around the world? I wonder about this because I see that stock price only going up and I am not sure why it does.

I am sick and tired of people saying weed stocks are a long term play, buy and hold in weed stocks especially the ones like SNDL will take your portfolio down to 99% in couple of months.   Even CGC has been down more than 60 percent from it's top before the pandemic even began.  If you cannot hold this stock and diamond hand's it for more than 6+ months then GTFO.

APHA holders who bought before pre legalization and never averaged down just went positive only for 1-2 days this week. They 💎🙌 it for 3+ years.

For example take a look at this post. [The Most Undervalue Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/9q58bx/is_sunniva_snn_snnvf_the_most_undervalued_company/), this post is found in r/weedstocks  when you sort it by top by all time.

Lot's of discord and slack pump and dump group's are involved where the runup a stock and then drop the price. These people do the charts in youtube.  If you are a normal investor who cannot spend the entire day day trading then you will loose your life savings.

Lets take a look at some popular weedstocks and how they are doing currently from 2018-2020.

charlotte web went from high $20 to $3.

Acreage Holding went from high $30 to $1.5 and bounced back.

I am not listing the absolute worst stocks from 2018/2019 time frame I am listing the ones that were very popular in r/weedstocks.

Even the ones with good earnings and management like TRUl, GTII, CRESCO, CURA and others went down to $2-$5 in march.

I told someone yesterday that SNDL would dump today or Friday and they asked me ""what my thesis was"". There is no thesis. You nerds can't just go by numbers or info about the company. This is human behavior and computer algos programmed by humans.

So let me lay out what happened with SNDL (and most meme stocks for that matter)

Early Adopter Phase - This was when SNDL was under $0.5 recently. People who suspect the stock is undervalued and a lot of bigger money investors are loading up. The stock may trade relatively flat or go through small increases.

Middle Phase - 01/28: SNDL spikes up to 100%, before closing the day up about 39% at $0.83. Very high volume on the day. This is where people who are watching for activity get in (I bought here).

Late/FOMO Phase - 02/08: SNDL spikes roughly 14% and goes into a stage of parabolic gains as retail buyers rush in and FOMO takes hold. Word spreads like wildfire across social media and forums. Everybody is aware at this point.

\*Short sellers know how this works as well and they will enter positions at some point during this phase

Profit Taking Phase - After a few days of huge gains on very high volume, buying reaches a crescendo. The earliest adopters have already made several times their initial investment and are ready to cash out. The people who bought in the middle know that the ""smart money"" has either already sold or is about to sell. This leads to chain reaction of increased selling. Fear can take hold over the Late Adopters as they do not want to lose money and panic sell.

Set for next cycle - The stock usually drills hard, followed by some more selling and/or a dead cat bounce if the drop is too drastic. Over the next trading sessions, price will go through smaller up an down bounces until a new ""baseline price"" is found. The stock will usually trade sideways for a bit until the cycle begins anew. (This last part is hard to predict). Stocks may see very little activity for weeks or months in this phase, or buyers may quickly regain interest, especially if a catalyst appears.

This isn't WSB doing this or the media or whatever grand conspiracy you think it is. It's happened many times and will continue to happen

**Edit**: Decided to scoop up some APHA, TLRY, and SNDL from the panic sellers during premarket. There's no ""set"" way to determine it, but I felt that all of these got ""oversold"" by the panic sellers. Retail usually buys high and sells low, be different.",2021-02-12 12:00:42

If you’re unfamiliar with this, it’s basically buying a cemetery plot before you need one. They’re typically financed over a 5 year term, but the revenue is instantly recognized.

The SCI team also pointed out on their last earnings call that their earnings were strong due to the unfortunate amounts of COVID deaths. This was during Q3 earnings, and you’ll see in the chart below that there were massive increases in deaths during Q4 compared to Q3. The pandemic has instilled fear in many, and as deaths increase, the fear increases. This will likely result in increases in at need services and preneed bookings.

Many companies benefited from COVID from a financial perspective. $SCI is one that has seen a major boost in revenue’s from the pandemic, however they will not experience the some drop off. Death is an unfortunate thing, but will happen to us all. The aging Boomer population will continue to result in increased revenues for $SCI

CDC Deaths 2020 Vs 2019 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm

The CDC is a bit behind on reporting of deaths, however most interesting correlation I found is that April had a major uptick in % differential for deaths. This major uptick, and sustained differential from April to September can arguably be attributed to the pandemic. Both due to COVID deaths, and indirect deaths as a result of the pandemic.

Old money trying to anticipate the top,85,lhzo7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhzo7n/old_money_trying_to_anticipate_the_top/,97,1613120018.0,"The past two days there have been pretty sharp intra-day declines across the stock market that more or less recover. These are rather concerted efforts, and I didn’t put together the pieces until I saw CNBC pushing the “froth” narrative. The first dip happened at 10AM on Wednesday and the second happened 12:00PM on Thursday, February 11th. 

The criteria seems to be NASDAQ Composite over 14k, Dow over 31.5k. Whoever is doing this is using ridiculously broad market sell orders across hundreds, if not thousands, of securities at the same time. I don’t have a Bloomberg terminal, but I think they are trying to time the moment when the order book is either the most full, or most empty. If they are targeting the order books at the thinnest, that may be an attempt to cause a market crash. 

However, if they are targeting the thickest or just a moderately full order book, then this is probably the collective consciousness of old money trying to time the market, and it will pass when they hear cool heads like Tom Lee explain the facts.

Everyone does it at this point, so there's not much you can do about it. That said, I think everyone should know when they're the product and not the customer.

My plan for maximum slow cooked chicken tendies,82,lhz4zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhz4zt/my_plan_for_maximum_slow_cooked_chicken_tendies/,93,1613118438.0,"Let's all take a second to look around. What's been happening here? Rockets here, rockets there. This whole fucking sub is filled with people throwing around their red rockets. Some of these rockets go up into the ethereal tendie heavens, but most go plunge straight into the markets gaping, mangy abyss.

Why do I mention rockets?

Enter ARKX. The rocket itself. The real deal rocket. For all you tards who haven't looked up from blowing bubbles in your cereal for the past 10 years, let me paint you a picture on what has been going on.

The future is here. We are in a god damned technological revolution. Most of all, we're in a new space race. ""Wait, you mean we're going back to blasting chimps into space then fingering their assholes when they get back, then telling the Reds to smell my finger?"" No. We're going to space to stay. And you what's going to happen up there? Industry.

NASA already estimates that wealth from mining minerals on asteroids is in the QUADRILLIONS. I call bullshit on that figure. The universe is infinite. Therefore there is infinite wealth up there. NASA's gonna go up there, and some cuck with a clipboard will be like, ""Yea, we lowballed that one."" 

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70)

I know, I know, all you dingleberrys that are stuck in the 80's, are thinking, ""NASA choked on Challenger's dick and died right there on the spot."" That's sure what it looked like. Well guess what. They're back, and they're now riding the coat tails of every fucking smooth-brained, money making messiah that you worship and make gainz off of. Did you look at the article that I linked? Probably not. I'll sum it up for you. Jeff Bezoz has his plans of going up there too, to do a little mining for himself. Look at his fucking head. Notice anything? IT'S SMOOTH AS EGGS. Draw your own conclusion on that one.

I don't really even need to touch on Papa Musk's plans. His mission is our mission. It's inherent at this point. You know everything that he touches turns into hard cash for you. Everytime you sit there trying to yank one out of your noodly, skinny pale trouser snake, you always have to, ""pour one out for Elon."" His target is to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050. 

[https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1)

Do you think he's going to overpromise and underdeliver on that? Do you know what his kid's name is? This man is looking so far into the future, we don't even have language to express his kid's name.

Here's what's going to happen. In no more than 10 years time. More like 5 years. Captain Kirk will be on TV trying to sell you intergalactic travel packages at discounted rates. Of course you go. Your buddy, Chad, is stuck flipping burgers on some distant mining base, talking up all the dividends he's racking up bi-annually off his companies plan. You, on the other hand, have more nefarious plans in mind. Sure it's fun to hit Chad's bong on the dark side of some cold asteroid and talk about the old days, but you have better plans. You've got a date with a cheap alien lady-boy whore, parked on lovers lane overlooking the Eagle Nebula. All the while, you plan on going knuckles deep in any mucous filled orifice you can find. And that's on a THURSDAY.

So here's the skinny on ARKX. Listen up. For all the ass hats who don't know who Cathie Wood is, you will now. In 2018, Papa Musk was in a bit of a rut. He was losing faith in TSLA, and contemplating it's future, (I know, hard to believe). In fact, it was so bad, Elon was practically begging to suck Tim Apples ding-a-ling to get bought up. 

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356)

You know who was there by Papa Musk's side? That's right. Meet your new mommy, Momma Wood. She gave Papa Elon the best fucking prostate orgasm ever, and with that, the clarity that TSLA was going to propel him to Mars and beyond. So every time you're having wet dreams about sucking Elon's monster dong, you're eternally in debt to Mama Wood. But she doesn't fault you for not giving her credit. You know why that is? Because she is a Goddess. She's humble. She knows that at some point, one day, your eyes will be opened, and that you will recognize her for her past efforts, and for her future plans. ARKX. She knows that once you have this realization, you will be bent over, gallon jug of off-branded cooking fat in hand, ready to have her peg your stanky ingrown hair infested asshole. You will be BEGGING her, ""MoAR tHicC GaINz, PLEEZE!"" 

So what's play here. I love a good YOLO. I wake up every morning expecting to see gainz porn from all these rocket launches we've been having. For me, personally, I'm mildly autistic. You could say half-autistic. My wife and her boyfriend's children are all autistic. I want the YOLO gainz, but I also want to know where to put some of my gainz, as my wife, her boyfriend, and their children are all dependent on me for money. So I got to be smart, you see. As I see it, ARKX is a slow cooker for your tendies. There's nothing like making a cool, quick ten bagger on some FD's. That rush is unmatched. That feeling of having a greasy burger after munching on your boyfriends asshole for an hour straight. ARKX, on the other hand, is like few have thought to experience. Like fine aged wine or whiskey. Slow cooked, tender, melt in your melt tendies. 100x in the next ten years, conservatively, tendies. Set-it-and-forget-it tendies. They practically fall apart in your mouth. 

This DD doesn't even begin to touch the vastness of what's all in play with space exploration plays.

I don't know what's going to be in ARKX, or where it will begin trading at. I also don't know the exact date it will begin trading, I heard the last week of March at the latest. Keep an eye out. I'm sure you will hear when it does commence. For me, I already threw a bunch of stagnant savings I had in ARKF. Let me tell you what, I am not disappointed I did that. When ARKX comes out, my IRA will be converted to ARKX, but I will be keeping my boomer AAPL, and holy TSLA shares. I will be set. I have utmost confidence this will be the easiest, long term print around. 

Thank you for your time. I'm a half retard, not an investment advisor. 

TLDR: ARKX will print you space tendies for all your orifice fingering needs.",2021-02-12 10:27:18

We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruin your wallet and faith in the stock market.

You might've heard ""you want to invest in your future."" Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off ""short ladder attacks"" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.

With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain ""confident"" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.

In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers.

**Company Statistics Over the Last Year back from December 2020**

* generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow;
* acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ;
* raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets
* opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;
* returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies)
* Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent).
* Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.
* Extensive, permanent cost-cutting measures were implemented to reduce operating expenses and offset revenue decline. (Leaner businesses are best equipped for a rebound in profits)

**Chart Analysis**

They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future.

**COVID Vaccines**

We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.

**Summary**

I know some of you see the market as a casino. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it hasn't already curved in a better direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?

Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.

[Heres someone way smarter than this retard confirming my beliefs.](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/fx_technical_weekly/2021/02/10/copper-price-outlook-bullish-as-breakout-begins.html)

The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost 3.59% which for copper is pretty fucking big. 

Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.

**AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED 2.74 MILLION SHARES**

[Order book screenshot](https://ibb.co/tMKDwGD)

2.74M shares, 85 Million dollars worth.

While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at -2.5% on a day where copper was +1.5%. Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another 1.5%, and today again where copper ended up +.2% and FCX was for some reason down again at -.8%. Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.

The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up 2.8% since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down 3.2%. That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.

I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with looming inflation and a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.

*********************** 
**RECAP**

Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla

**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?

Cool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...

**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.

After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.

**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** EPS beats estimates, $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).

 After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. 

Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest. 

But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush...sell limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.   

So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's ""Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name."" Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9

But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to ""Neutral"" from ""Buy"", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)

**************************************************************************
**CURRENT SITUATION**

That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue...yet $3.9B market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. 

Compare that to LOGI..$2.9B revenue ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). **1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.** 

But CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?

Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day? http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html 

Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)

But pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.

And what also happened today? The P OTUS just [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  

The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more. 

They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away

Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential. 

With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. 

Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least.

Do we have the power to move the stock market or not? Just 2 weeks ago the overwhelming sentiment was ""this is the hedge funds game, we're just trying to catch a ride. Individual retail investors can't do shit to move markets. We're hyennas picking at Zebra carcasses, but sooner or later the Lions are going to come back and reclaim their feast."" 

Now it's a complete 180. I'm seeing tons of outrage from people who got burnt today on their weed calls. Acting like this lot of new degenerates came in and pumped the price before bailing, thus crushing the overall market. 20% gains for them cost you tens of thousands on your call options. Well, how much blame does the media get? 8 million people in this sub is a lot, but how many people does CNBC, Fox Business, The Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, The New York Times, etc. Reach? When they all band together and spend 2-3 full trading days only talking about ""the new Wall Street Bets move"", how many day traders come running? Just Google ""Wall Street Bets weed"" to see what I'm talking about.

We're either being played, or it's actually us having this big of an impact on the market. I don't know the answer. So let's look at both scenarios. 

**We control the market**

This is dope! We can work with this, and grow into it, but first I want to get something off my chest. FUCK YOU! Talkin bout ""degenerates ruining my weed plays"". Bitch, what have you been chortling about with GME this whole time? ""💎🖐🦍 Gang got greedy and forgot to hedge profits."" 
""I took my gains at 300 like a pro."" 
""It's so funny how the smooth brains got left holding the bag."" 
Preaching about holding the line in January while you turned 100 @ $5 into 15 @ $50, then switched to pissing on ""bag holders"" for ""getting played"" in February. 

If we truly have the power to move markets, then the $10's of millions in profits everyone took is what brought down the rising market caps. It also bailed out the shorts who were/are less than halfway done covering (TLRY has high SI too). Then we went and did the exact same thing with weed stocks. Don't hate the player, hate the game right? Ultimately, something tells me stocks don't move up when everyone is trying to play with house money. Definitely can't ""hold any lines"" with house money either. We should invest in stocks we care about for their long term potential; any squeezes or pumps that potentially come out of that are just an added benefit.

**We don't have the power to move markets** 

That's cool. We're still getting blamed for it, though. Not just from salty weed ""bag holders"" in here, but from all of the media. We got blamed for this meteoric rise, and within 20 minutes of the tank in pre-market CNBC was already pointing the finger at us. Weed Stocks have been on the rise for 3 months, if you guys were just riding a wave none of us ""retail traders"" have any control over, then what crashed it? I won't speculate on that because it falls under ""conspiracy bullshit"" but we should discuss it. I posted [this thread this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm0wz/were_weed_stocks_and_silver_pumped_by_hfs_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) claiming it was a diversion attempt away from GME, and urged people to ""cash out their gains before it crashes."" I wrote it before the price tanked. The mods deleted it, and rightfully so. I don't have any evidence to back up that theory. What I'm trying to say now isn't about GME either. 

However, if we don't actually have any control over the stock market we should be using the media manipulation to make fat gains before we get fucked by big time day traders and algorithm options trading. As soon as they dump a trend on us, we should dump that trend. If the price follows immediately, we'll know we actually have control of these markets, if it doesn't we'll know we're getting played and figure out why. What do you guys think? Quit ""REEEEE""-ing all over the place and let's figure this shit out!!

New People: Understand the difference between MEME content and actual trading habits,451,lhx6q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhx6q0/new_people_understand_the_difference_between_meme/,92,1613112817.0,"Because my last post got deleted, here's a more ""friendly"" version.

The memes on here use to be hilarious, uncensored, offensive and some of the worst advice you could possibly imagine. The thing is people understood the humor. Most understood market fundamentals and traded options. If you trade options you're a big brain mf, congrats and fuck you.

But new people reposting these shitpost memes everywhere, on every social media channel, comment thread, where ever, you're kinda fucking it up imo.

There was a massive difference between sharing personal investment/yolo stories to a group of 10-900K people and trying to hype up specific stocks to 8.9 MILLION or more random folks.

Ever since GME, WSB has become famous. So famous that [an ETF is being developed that will track trending stocks on social media like WSB.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/vaneck-social-sentiment-etf-target-social-media-reddit-meme-stocks-2021-2-1030056054) People with money are going to take advantage of this easily influenced massive group of retail traders for their own gain if they haven't already.

&#x200B;

So what is the message here?

You should know the difference between investing and gambling, between GME and any other stock. Memes for GME do NOT apply to EVERY OTHER STOCK when it falls or when you're holding. The memes were fun but they really ONLY APPLIED to the GME situation.

If you want to invest please please please spend some time getting a basic understanding of volatility, risk management, trend patterns. Read the analysis behind companies before you invest. This is probably the ONLY time where ""Do your own research"" ACTUALLY BENEFITS YOU.

And always remembers that if you're gambling to rapidly make gains, you can just as suddenly lose your money.

Enjoy the memes, just don't bet on them.

Housing absolutely went in the toilet, and housing bonds were a god damn black hole sucking Fannie and Freddie closer and closer to insolvency. Well, in walks the US government which created the FHFA. These guys were, and are, the oversight to Fannie and Freddie. The deal that was struck dolled out about 190B to shore up their balance sheets and the government got senior preferred shares at 10%, plus warrants for 80% of the companies. Other parts of the agreement forced payments equaling the entire market cap of each *quarterly*. This was completely untenable, and they had to borrow more money just to pay it, so that was nixed. Instead, amendment 3 was put into effect. This capped the capital each could hold at 3B and *all* profits go to the US treasury. Ever since the crash Fannie and Freddie have been held in this limbo called conservatorship. The amount of profit robbed from shareholders by the government to date is $124B. 

This would create a lot of outrage, right? Well there’s a case pending at the Supreme Court, advocating for their $124 billion. The crazy part is how the case is being argued. They aren’t just saying the agreement was unlawful. They are saying *the structure of their FHFA regulator* is unconstitutional. That structure isn’t unique.

I'm late to GME and bought into the hype. Every day I've been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study u/deepfuckingvalue activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

>People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

>The “shift to digital” thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB.

PLTR DD - Earnings Play - Why This time is Different,322,lhtkgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhtkgb/pltr_dd_earnings_play_why_this_time_is_different/,215,1613103267.0,"\*not financial advice.

PLTR is an amazing opportunity rn. I did a DD on here for Nio when it was around  $39. Today was a bad day and we're still over 60. It doesn't make me more credible per se, but hear me out. 

I'm a catalyst trader. I go in before huge events. PLTR has an upcoming catalyst, and a compelling reason for the stonk price to be super high in the lead up to earnings.

**Catalyst:** PLTR's earnings is scheduled before market on Tuesday, 16th. 

**I. What happened before?**   
1) On November 12, PLTR's Q3 earnings was a whopping +125% surprise. Stonk prices skyrocked in the following weeks.   


2) On January 26, PLTR had a Live Demo Day. The stonk prices went from 26 to 39 leading up to Demo day, and then all the way up to 45 after Demo Day.   


**Thesis:** PLTR's scheduled events tend to pump the stonk prices in the build up and in the aftermath as well.  


**II. Earnings are volatile. Why play this one?**   
**A) Incentives:**  
PLTR's share lockout expiration happens days after earnings. Better earnings, equals better stonk prices, equals a better payout for those with the stock options. It's much more logical to pump the price up (legally through enthusiasm, etc) because the expiration will tank the price anyway, even if it's the bottom. 

I was offered share options from a startup once and understand the psychology of how this works. Imagine waiting for years to have your shares worth something, secondly, imagine owning tens-of-thousands of shares that you could just sell and become an overnight millionaire. If you never had a million dollars before, you wouldn't really care about timing the sale tbh, unless you're DFV (I don't think he works for PLTR). So the lockout expiration will very likely lead to a temporary selloff.  


**B) IV**  
The IV for PLTR is high. If you buy calls, buy leaps. I'm buying calls because I'm an autist. But if you wanna play it safe, do something else. Like play iron condor. Or just sell puts. Or ignore IV, buy shares, sell calls at the top. You'll have to time the top during/after earnings, but sell before the IV Crush. You could literally go about this in so many different ways and still make money.   


**C) Solid Performance and Partnerships**  
IBM, Rio Tinto, Cathie Wood's addition of shares, Blackrock's increase of shares, and a potential Facebook partnership. To be honest, the FB partnership rumor is probably fake, but, there was promise of another announcement near earnings. 

**TLDR -** I don't normally play earnings, but PLTR seems like a great play rn with many different opportunities.   
I apologize if I'm wrong about an earnings beat. I'm not a psychic. But I believe in the long term--this guy's going to 100+. So buy leaps and shares.",2021-02-12 06:14:27

The Boussoura Project is still in its early days, yet we are growing more confident in the scale of this project, with a large land package host to numerous veined corridors running over extensive strike lengths and with numerous targets identified between Fofora and Galgouli with similar geochemistry and geophysical anomalies. We will continue to keep the drills turning at Boussoura, as we look to continue to expand and define the mineralized footprint towards the goal of a maiden resource by year end.""

You may be concerned about mining in Africa, especially a country like BF. This is a valid concern, governments have not always been favorable to mining in Africa. It seems however, that BF has switched gears and is starting to move in a positive direction, the country has even eliminated a 10% tax on mining operations.

Deepest Value Stock Near Book Value Rdy for a Squeeze ($UWMC),170,lhvcol,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcol/deepest_value_stock_near_book_value_rdy_for_a/,159,1613107877.0,"First off, the obligatory, I used to be a financial analyst, but this is not financial advice and you should do your own DD.


Like my hero DFV, my bread and butter is to invest in extremely undervalued value companies in this frothy market environment with vix spikes happening every few days. If you follow DFV and watch his vids, you'll know that he bought GME for its value, and the gamma/short squeeze was icing.


This might be a long post, so skip to TLDR if you don't care about market logic. To begin, why is the #1 wholesale & purchase mortgage lender in USA so cheap you might ask? Well, I can't give you any one particular reason, but GHIV was one of the biggest spacs merger ever, and it might have suffered from the a spac speculative life cycle, and the shorts are in control, and oh boy, are they in control. Money these days have been flowing from GME/AMC and the like to weed, looking for whatever the next trend is--Twitter or not (yes, Zack Morris and the Atlas crew also love UWMC, and their cost basis is a lot higher than today's price).


It is borderline shameful how low this stock is, I mean I like me some FUTU and SNDL too, but I'd have to make it a point to check futures along w/ my midnight pee sessions if I were to dump my entire portfolio in those names. This thing has a **tangible book value of $7.75/sh**, that means if the company's financials were horrible, and they made no money, and decided to declare bankruptcy, and after they liquidate all their assets to satisfy their debt, shareholders will get back $7.75/sh. But no, their financials and balance sheet are immaculate, and they absolutely smashed earnings, originating 54.7B in loan volume, up 71% y/y, with a 4th qtr net income of  $1.37B vs. 108.72M (that's billion vs. million) in the same qtr last year,  and FY20 net income of  $3.38B, an **821%** and **715%** increase over 4Q19 and FY19, respectively.


Also, during the earnings call, they declared a dividend of $.40/yr, as of today's price, this is a **4.5% div. yield** with ex. div date on 3/9. Their EBITDA growth has outpaced their top line revenue growth, which signifies a margin expansion. They are getting more profitable every year, with good guidance on their call. Their forward P/E was 6.21 this morning, compared to that of RKT at $10.94. UWMC should be at a good value of around **$16.5** if we use RKT as a fair comp, although I would argue that RKT is slightly undervalued as well.


**Short Interest:**

As of yesterday, it had a short interest of **36.2%** with only 50k shares available to short at a 7.9% fee. When I tried to short 1 share on IBKR this morning, there were none available. I don't normally pick stocks based on short interest, but like DFV, this is an added icing for a major squeeze. It also has a short ratio of about 1.6, so it'll take at least 1.6 days for shorts to cover if there is a day of pure buys. The higher the ratio means more covering with higher volume spikes, which brings in more buyers.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC


**Gamma Strip:**

The option flow on this is absolutely bonkers with 45k calls and 2k puts, there are gargantuan gamma ramps at 10, 12.5, 15, and 17, with $15 being the largest at every expiry. Once volume picks up and people realize how undervalued this stock is, it will quickly ramp to 15 via MM's delta hedging.


**Ownership:**

This is 34% instutionally owned with Phoenix Holding buying 2.5M shares today, making them 5.88% owners of the company. After today's buy, I would expect that institutionally owned number to reach 40%.


**Max Pain:**

I posted a DD on PCG a while ago and I rode it up from $8.50 to $13, so I understand how these stocks are artificially suppressed. PCG had a larger institutional ownership at around 80%, and it was curious to me how every opex date ended right around max pain. So even if that were the case here, max pain is at $10 on Feb 19, with the next lower strike ($7.5) losing 184.72% of contract value vs the next higher strike ($12.5) losing only 59.839%. I am fairly confident this will be above $10 by then.

**TA:**

UWMC is at the bottom of a channel with a lot of support from hfs buying anything below today. It is trading very near their book/NAV, and I think today's Phoenix 2.5m, a new 5.88% position will get some eyes on this gem. I have no doubt it will run up for ex-div date as well. There is bullish divergence and I see volume coming in the next few days. My personal price target is at $25-$30 within a year, and this constitutes as a long term hold for me.


**Tech:**
One of the things I like the most is their mobile app that gives independent brokers the ability to underwrite a loan from open to close, their companion app can pull credit reports, get e-sigs, and act as a point of sale and loan origination system. If they make it user assessible to retail clients, like how they do it in Asia with BEKE, I can see a big bottom-line bonus here.


**TLDR:**

**Heavily shorted, highly undervalued, hf darling with a book/sh of $7.74 trading at a forward p/e of only 6.21. My position: Breaking my rule of 2-5% allocation per ticker; 60% of my portfolio in shares @ 9.70s average; 10, 12.5, 15 calls.**",2021-02-12 07:31:17
I'm on for $ON,333,lhvcqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcqm/im_on_for_on/,184,1613107880.0,"ON Semiconductors. 

We all know we're in a current market shortage of semiconductors. You can see this in the retail markets with GPU and CPU shortages, but we also have a shortage in the industrial sectors too. Our modern economy is rife with robots and computers everywhere from factories to your living room. All of those electronics need semiconductors and chips. 

$ON makes Memory, they make audio processors, they make LCD drivers, they make switches, sim card readers, thermal sensors, light readers, motor drivers, DC regulator, and USB controllers. [They make all the shit that makes robots work,](https://www.onsemi.com/products) and they make custom solutions too. 

We all know that robots are taking over our jobs, and that robots have been storming manufacturing for the last decade. Now $ON sits on a huge demand for these parts because the other companies like MU and TSM are spending all their resources trying to meet the big GPU and CPU demands. 

Other manufacturing is getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly line robots, it means motor controls for cnc machines and shop equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave, it even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a power switch, which are made by $ON. 

But don't take my word for it. Look at it's charts. 
[here's the 3 month.](https://i.imgur.com/YDuwykA.png?1)
[here's the 6 month.](https://i.imgur.com/RZo5uTD.png?1)
[and here's all time.](https://i.imgur.com/2t0uzLA.png?1)

This thing is primed to go, and already creeping up steadily on the fundamentals. It's already a mainstream company in the manufacturing world, a big name. I think its primed to continue to moon as the current shortage deepens with the ever increasing advancement to smaller and smaller nanonmeter fabrication techniques by the GPU and CPU manufacturers. 

edit: ([credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcqm/im_on_for_on/gn04451/) to u/Mzart713 for the link) There also is talk of a [Biden admin subsidy program](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) for semiconductors, which i expect to be targeted at US semi's, which ON is one of the largest, and also has probably the biggest impact on automotive manufacturing, which is also a concern for the Biden admin.

"AMKR - Amkor Technology - A Great Play in the Semi Conductor Space - CRIMINALLY Undervalued, literally can't go tits up!",173,lhv717,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhv717/amkr_amkor_technology_a_great_play_in_the_semi/,175,1613107495.0,"EDIT: So we are are almost up over 10% since I wrote this DD. Steady 3-4% both days. That is what we need, slowly ride this baby to to the moon

Been a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:

**AMKR – Amkor Technology** \- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B

This is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.

Position – 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16

Now that is out of the way, lets get to it.

**What do you look for in a great DD:**

1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment
2. Financials are solid
3. Outlook is great
4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued
5. There is an upcoming catalyst

Before I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.

So now lets get to it:

&#x200B;

1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***

Unless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don’t believe me here you go:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)

Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.

&#x200B;

***2.*** ***Financials are solid***

I can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.

While I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.

Okay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79

Like I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

&#x200B;

***3. Outlook is great:***

Well, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:

“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”

UMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation

Also to recap their 2020 highlights

Full Year 2020 Highlights:

Net sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million

Sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow

Financial information on the company:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

&#x200B;

***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***

I mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.

Undervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don’t know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!

I mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40

&#x200B;

*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***

Well company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)

**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.

This alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Yes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but

1. The outlook is better than ever in company’s history
2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion
7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!
8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours

I am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.

As always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!

PSA: Don’t throw good money after bad,481,lhv3cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhv3cx/psa_dont_throw_good_money_after_bad/,197,1613107217.0,"To all novice investors now frequenting this sub, here’s some helpful advice. It’s a trap to continue investing in your losing positions. If you’re a bagholder, the way out is not to funnel more funds into a sinking stock, averaging down. The better strategy is to invest in other stocks with clear upward momentum and trends. Use gains to offset your losses. Diversify your portfolio for better results.

It sucks being a bag holder. I know the feeling. I owned CCL for the dividend before Covid. Then the pandemic crushed the cruise lines and my position. Suddenly I was down 70% on the stock. But I did not invest another dollar into CCL since the health crisis began. Instead of averaging down, I put that money to better use in stocks that could benefit from the pandemic and economic recovery. Subsequently, I’ve enjoyed an incredible past year, making a ton of money while leaving my CCL loss in the rearview mirror. 

Throwing good money after bad is a self-defeating move. Remember: the point of investing is to *make money* — not gradually lose more and more of it in a position that’s clearly shrinking in value. Invest in winners, not losers.

This is not professional financial advice. Do what you will, of course. I just hate seeing newer folks lose money when they don't have to. We all come here to see green in our portfolios. You can, too.",2021-02-12 07:20:17

You'll see:

1. They are using Toshiba cells, not their own.
2. Cooling batteries is known to make them charge faster and have greater efficiency.

This is not next gen. It's a new battery cooler. I'm sure it's cool, but it's not 1 billion in market cap cool.

Boring af. Think cardboard company selling boxes to Amazon. But they've got: 
-solid earnings track record ($1.39/s TTM)
-low PE (9.18 FWD looking)
-upward trajectory earnings estimates ($1.69/s projected this year)
-a large portion of the market share selling B2B in an industry that has been killing it for years.

I usually skip on companies that beat earnings and gap up cause I figure I missed the boat. But I think this still has room to run. They've broken out of the 20 day SMA on the news this week of an earnings beat (Monday) that they will be added to the S&P midcap 400 (yesterday). **This means index etfs will start scooping up shares.** And Citi analyst price target increases today to $15 from $13 https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amkor-technology-stock-just-jumped-again-2021-02-11

Granted it's currently trading well above that higher price target but it seems analysts are rarely willing to reach ahead of an uptrending stock, and they just follow it up with trailing estimates. What's more important is the fact that they found reason to move it at all.

$EWJ - JOIN MICHAEL BURRY IN AN ETF WITH CONCRETE POSITIVE GROWTH,141,lhu6vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhu6vv/ewj_join_michael_burry_in_an_etf_with_concrete/,77,1613104903.0,"Earlier this week, our beloved Dr. Michael Burry (the dude who predicted the housing crisis, the dude who predicted GME, the dude who predicts fucking everything honestly), tweeted about Japan finally lifting their “iron coffin lid” as he called it. While this tweet is now deleted, as Burry frequently wipes his Twitter, it led me down a hole which I believe to have discovered a golden opportunity. This “iron coffin lid” of Japan’s has been rumored to break free for a while now, but hasn’t. 

[https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid](https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid) 

[https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html](https://www.economicperspectives.co.uk/japanese-equities-can-the-coffin-lid-be-lifted.html) 

Yet, Burry believes the time has finally come. As such he is heavenly invested in Japanese corporations. 

An excerpt from Burry’s tweet: “#ironcoffinlid opening? If so, the contents are the likes of which are never seen in the western world.”

This led me to find, $EWJ. An ETF consisting of **85% OF JAPAN’S STOCKS**. (That’s a lot!). No, you didn't read that wrong. Not 85% of EWJ consists of Japanese stock, EWJ consists of roughly 85% of the investible universe of securities traded in Japan. 

Some of the top companies that they hold the majority of their equity in include:

**NINTENDO**

**SONY**

**TOYOTA**

**MITSUBISHI**

**TOKYO ELECTRON**

**SOFTBANK GROUP**

I mean wow, what a stacked top contenders list.

**Nintendo only has positive year after year growth**, and after the revolution of the Switch, they are back on their feet with eyes forward. 

**Sony only has positive year after year growth.** Sony is a company that pioneers technology in all aspects, video-games, TV, music, etc. 

**Toyota only has positive year after year growth.** I expect this to skyrocket as well as we transition to the age of EVs. *Earlier this week Toyota announced their electric vehicles are coming THIS YEAR. Toyota also recently partnered with PANASONIC to manufacture their batteries for said EVs.* 

**While Mitsubishi has had their ups and downs, we still see a net positive year after year return.** Mitsubishi is Japan’s *LARGEST TRADING COMPANY. With HIGH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022+ AS THEY MOVE INTO EVs AS WELL.*

**Tokyo Electron** **only has positive year after year growth**. Going from a penny stock to $100 in less than 5 years, Tokyo Electron is looking like a very serious worldwide company moving forward. Founded in 1963, Tokyo Electron has been a manufacturer of ***semiconductors***, technology for the future that they have been pioneering for 50 YEARS NOW. You know all the people spamming $ON on here? That is a semiconductor play as well. This is just a safer gateway into that industry.

**SoftBank Group only has positive year after year growth.** Softbank is *THE WORLD’S LARGEST TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL FUND, WITH OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL.* 

These 6 are simply a very small few of EWJ’s top holdings. As you can see the road ahead is bright, almost blinding. EWJ took a dip during COVID, but is now coming out of that hole stronger and faster. If we take a look at EWJ’s chart we can see a lot of consistent breakout patterns occurring recently, lining up with Burry’s idea. 

Let’s take a look at the covid dip:

![img](uzamwpn52rg61 ""
"")

As we can see in early 2020 when we saw covid happen, the 100-day average passed downward through the 20-day average, as we spiral down. **However, we then see one of the quickest recoveries ever during the pandemic** as already in April the 20 day average passes through the 100 day and we begin our flight to the moon.

I decided to snoop around WSB and see if anyone else was talking about this. I stumbled upon u/ThePoorLad’s post where he also notes a breakout pattern. His image below:

https://preview.redd.it/n940mw4c2rg61.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21596b94408506af11a5e4d6194aea781644fca2

Yet, let's continue snooping around EWJ’s graph and see if we find anything worth paying attention to..

As you can see, this week we have a very prevailing and very bullish staircase pattern, this following Burry’s tweet, seems to be the beginning of EWJ’s true soar to 100+. 

The options for EWJ have little to no volume. They are cheap as fuck. This is a stock no one fucking knows about. It just seems like a random Japan ETF, “who would want to get in on that?” No one realizes what's about to happen, (except our boy Burry). This is a golden opportunity to get in before the crowd. 

Look at these **2023 LEAPS**, 20 FUCKING 23, and look how cheap they are.

EWJ has gone up $30 alone in the past half-year, and that is without this ""iron coffin lid"" rising. In my opinion, EWJ will EASILY hit 105 in **2021, let alone 2022 or 2023**. Take a look at the rest of the call sheet, yourself, they are cheap as fuck. 

Earlier this week Financial Times posted an article talking about how Japanese stocks are climbing to their highest levels since 1991. The stars are all aligning.

Position: 2023 100C @ 105

**TLDR:** *Michael Burry believes Japan’s iron coffin lid will open to the likes of things that the western world has never seen. $EWJ only has positive growth potential and is about to break out. Options are also cheap as fuck. Moon mission has already begun.*  *🚀*

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: ""companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD’s newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today’s increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies — including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota — have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages.""

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

The MM (Market Manipulation fyi) on top of the over-fixation of the Lockup and the bi-polar MKT have really been the biggest things that have stopped [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) fucking cold from climbing higher up the mountain.

Nobody really seems to really be prioritizing the ER on Tuesday. And with how deep down we've gone in the rabbit hole, it isn't really helping our case to just ""be faithful"" and ""BTFD"" for these Shorters/soon to be. Everyone's just focused on the next Catalyst 3 days after it which is going to Pullback on the price - for the short term. So possible Holders are waiting on that before buying in and myopic Bulls are selling because ""it isn't $40 fml"" and are reacting to the sudden drops + Lockup as their confirmation.

Don't get me wrong, ER is still significant. There still is hype around it that isn't just going to vanish. And with how badly PLTR has dropped since yesterday (back to the old ATH), then some people are going to be a bit interested; cheap shares, cheap calls right. So some positive volume can come from that. But understand, whatever happens there/tmrw will define how next week is going to go into the Lockup as Monday is closed off due to being a holiday. They will be the impetuses, if good or bad, for the weekly trend basically.

Still, this type of plunge manifests despite huge contracts being signed left and right, with no Bear signals/bad news against it other than valuation, which is as irrelevant as it has ever been in this warped MKT. The IBM deal which was a huge deal for Palantir... wiped away in 2 days, like all the other deals, trounced. Bull Catalysts, which should build hype for ER - the biggest Bull Catalyst of all - don't mean jack and it ""surprisingly"" goes into the Red big time, the opposite of what should occur.

Really the manipulation on this stock is beyond apparent. The hate against it is well documented and it dates back to the start when they opened the way Big Daddy Institutions didn't want. When ""MM"" is really the only major thing that can be said about going against such an initially great Bull Run + why it's doing what it's doing, then you know something has to be a little wonky internally. It's not natural.

But really, ain't much we can do about it. At this point, I said to go for the ER but with how bad of a spot we're in, idek what to say. Really if you're not Long/Deep in the Money and you're just a newb who wants to get in, really I say just wait it out. Palantir is so volatile and irrationally controlled that anything could really happen from now until the Lockup.

And look, this is a great company, with great tech. It's a great hold for the Long and years down the road. But in the short term, it's going through these violent financial assaults constantly, and it throws the stock back down as soon it somewhat starts to shoot up into the sky. It really isn't all the stable right now. But for those who know PLTR, follow the routine, it ain't gonna change and that's a fact. For those who still don't know how it goes in its way up the mountain? It is what it is.

The Retail Trader Wave,46,lht2ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lht2ai/the_retail_trader_wave/,28,1613102016.0," 

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what ""up & coming"" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know.

\*\*So what has happened?\*\*

\*\*Part 1 - Gamestop\*\*

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief.

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.

This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could.

\*\*Part 2 - The Fallout\*\*

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind ""What stocks are the next GME?"" & ""Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?"".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms.

\*\*Part 3 - Thesis\*\*

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that.

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently ""seemingly"" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.

I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.

I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?

Personally these are the steps I have taken.

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple.

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into a Tanzanian gold company stock, ""why"", you may ask, ""have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company?"" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1.",2021-02-12 05:53:36
Adaptability makes HYLN a diamond in the rough [DD],329,lhsm8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhsm8e/adaptability_makes_hyln_a_diamond_in_the_rough_dd/,132,1613100916.0,"**TLDR: Hyliion is a gateway drug to EV and their adaptability in the Class 8 industry makes them a great long term play with deep fucking value🚀.**

It seems like everyday there is a new company coming out of the woodworks with a plan for hydrogen fuel cell trucks or fully electric powertrains. While the Biden administration has certainly added some fuel to the EV fire, everyone (including that gay 🌈🐻 Mark Delaney from GS) seems to be sleeping on a company that is poised to succeed no matter what renewable energy solution is chosen.

While still in its early stages as a company after going public (via S word) in late 2020, Hyliion (HYLN), provides **full powertrain solutions** for fleets through 2 main products:

1. **Hybrid Diesel or CHG** – as the name states this is an electric hybrid powertrain with either Diesel or renewable natural gas. There are some interesting differences between the diesel & CNG options, but we’ll save that for another time. These **powertrains are available now** and they have been shipping in low volumes this year with volume expected to increase throughout the year. The great thing with this solution is it can be **installed on most major Class 8 trucks with no additional driver training**.
2. **Hypertruck ERX** – this is the secret sauce that our buddy Thomas Healy will (IMO) change the world with. This is a fuel agnostic, fully electric powertrain that uses an **onboard generator** powered by RNG (for now) to locally charge the truck. This reduces the need for a large battery pack that cuts into the payload capacity of the truck while also extending the range of the truck to well over **1,000** **miles.** Hyliion has already partnered with American Natural Gas (ANG) to ensure they can not only meet the demand for RNG, but they can leverage this partnership to offer fleets better pricing across the country.

These two products provide HYLN the adaptability needed in these uncertain times. Right now, their approach is to go with RNG since the infrastructure is already there across the country & it is ready to be rolled out in full production by 2022. 🌈🐻 Mark Delaney must have had Elon’s cock in his ear during the last Tesla earnings call, because he seemed to miss him saying “it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint”. Never doubt Elon, but it doesn’t sound like they will be in full production with the Semi by 2022 (even if they plan to build a plant in NV this year). With that being said, Hyliion is already producing & selling their Hybrid solution, with the hope to launch demo ERX with fleets this year, while starting production in 2022.

Which brings us to the most important question, how are they manufacturing these things? Unlike building their own plants, which has its own pros/cons, HYLN is partnering with others. This accelerates the timeline of getting products to the market and allows them to **focus on what they are good at.**

***Isn’t the increased demand in Hydrogen fuel cell a concern for a company that is focused on RNG***\*\*?\*\* No and no. Everyone loves to talk about hydrogen but no one seems to be realistic about when it will be ready. Aside from the lack of infrastructure across the country that will take years to build out, the cost of hydrogen is more than **10x higher than natural gas**. Not only are the costs higher, but the way a majority of hydrogen is currently being produced is coming from steam methane which is more pollutive than a diesel truck. AND even if all of those negatives were solved by next year, Hyliion is still working on a hydrogen solution (in addition to RNG) for their onboard generators for the Hypertruck. Essentially they have you covered if you want to go the RNG route or Hydrogen (when ready).

***The cost of Diesel is below $3, will this affect the appetite for companies to adopt EV?*** [According to Healy](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1425939&tp_key=75b5f9e241), with diesel at $3 there is a **2 year payback period** for fleet operators. Obviously as prices go lower this payback period increases, but most fleets have a 5-7 year lifespan so adding a year or two to the PP doesn’t have much of an impact considering the benefits.

***Price target?*** I am not a financial advisor, but I am a little autistic so I dug into [Hyliions original investor presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm) from their pre-IPO. We haven’t really gotten any new updates to these numbers, but I still think this is a hidden gem based on their projections. Assuming the Hypertruck meets all of their expectations, they anticipate around 2% of the Class 8 market share by 2024 (a more than $94 billion addressable market). If they can reach EBITDA of $602m by 2024 as projected, then a price of $18/share should be the floor right now. However, with some good/bad news on the upcoming Feb 23 earnings call this could all change in an instant.

It is my belief that gold peaked in August 2020 and will continue to decline from current levels through the rest of this year.  Here are my reasons.  

1.  There is not enough inflation in the US dollar to drive prices up further.  
2. There is no shortage and never will be.  
3. The charts peaked in August and are now in pattern of making new low then recovering before making another new low.  
4. Gold is boomer shit.  People would rather buy digital coins, weed, or SPACs with their stimulus money.  
5. India/China are big importers for jewelry and increased prices have a big impact on demand.  
6. Interest rates aren't going up anytime soon.  
7. Gold is trading below falling 10, 20, 50 day moving averages.  
8. If economy booms, people will sell gold to buy better returning investments.
9. If economy gets worse, people will sell gold to buy other assets.

"SNDL and a Warning to all Penny Stocks Futures, post GME hype",1351,lhrirw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhrirw/sndl_and_a_warning_to_all_penny_stocks_futures/,501,1613098062.0,"\*This is NOT Financial advice. This is strictly an opinion based post\*  


TLDR, post-GME, WSB became a pack of brainless wolves who hunt down penny stocks and spam the yahoo conversations with the same tired ""LeT's tAkE tHiS sToCk tO 100!!11!!""  


The group retardation is exponential when you also hear shit like ""I'm down 100k but w/e we're still going to the moon"". Not only retarded, but gluttons for punishment. It's as if losing money somehow temporarily ""boosts"" your group think morale before you reality sets in and you realize there's no way back out.   


Do you even know how a company is valuated? You can artificially pump all you want, it doesn't actually MAKE the company worth what you've inflated it to. I can't believe I have to explain this, but for serious investors in this who have done their DD, would project to sell at a set point (if they're risk averse). Anything beyond that point is pure volatility. a stock like SNDL would NEVER organically hit $100 with the current state of their business. Even with you retards pumping it up artificially, it would never hit $100 anyway because any reasonable person would start dumping once they see the kind of manipulation is at play. Case and point, the events of SNDL this fucking morning. Do you still think it'll go to $100?   


I used to take the word ""retard"" being thrown around here in jest; but now I'm pretty convinced that the folks ( as mentioned in my previous example above) are un-ironically retarded. 

Is this going to be the new thing now? Every Penny stock going to be pumped and dumped? You realize by doing this, you're no fucking better than the hedge funds you purportedly hate. You're acting as a hive mind to inflate then dump. This is why I think post GME, WSB has and will continue to decline unless something is done about this. 

So, for those actually looking to invest wisely here, if you ever see a penny stock being posted with no DD or futures to back it up, do yourself a favour and avoid the risk. Yes, you can probably get real lucky and ride the short term wave then dump, but if you're wanting to be a SERIOUS investor, just ignore the bullshit posted here.   


Making money is fun until you lose it all.  


On a more sober note, SNDL's futures are somewhat hopeful (my personal opinion) based on some POTENTIAL acquisitions, so I will be sticking around for a little bit. Am I taking a risk? Yes. This is still a speculative stock, and fortunately I don't gamble away a mortgage for something like this.",2021-02-12 04:47:42
Panasonic - Possibly Good For Future,30,lhrhve,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhrhve/panasonic_possibly_good_for_future/,34,1613097995.0,"Trying to get away from all these retarded meme stocks and pump and dumps and present something that may have potential in the future.

Panasonic. 

As you probably already know, Panasonic already has a deal with Tesla for batteries, however Musk wants to produce his own soon but that deal lasts until 2022 I believe. 

Just last year, Panasonic entered a [deal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2020/02/03/toyota-and-panasonic-launch-joint-ev-battery-venture/?sh=61a565dd4c3a) to jointly produce lithium ion batteries. They also plant to set up a [factory](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toyota-panasonic-batteries/toyota-panasonic-venture-to-build-lithium-ion-batteries-for-hybrids-in-japan-idUSKBN26R0LW) in 2022 which will produce lithium ion batteries for more than 500k cars a year. As EV vehicles come into prominence, I think Toyota's position will be unique as Toyota is consistent and dead set on quality. 

Panasonic is trading at $13 right now and I think it is a good buy that will pay off in the future.

How to secure gains and avoid bags with simple limit sales/limit gains. Listen up NEW INVESTORS.,154,lhrhr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhrhr2/how_to_secure_gains_and_avoid_bags_with_simple/,91,1613097987.0,"Learn how to use limit gains and stop loss sales to earn money.

Limit gains work by auto selling your stock when it hits a price point that is higher than the stock price, and gains are  enough to be satisfied.

Stop loss sales: stop loss sales are sett up to limit the amount of money you can lose b4 your stock auto sells. These are used to guarantee your minimum acceptable gains and get out b4 you hold the bag. 

Example: bought 100 sundial stocks at 1.99$ avg price and when it hit 3.52$ last night I put a stop loss sale at 2.75$ I overslept last night and missed the surge, and I should have put a limit gain @ 4$, but I forgot too. The stop loss sale executed at 2.89$ making me about 95$ before the stock plummeted to 2.20$ potentially eliminating all my gains. I'm a broke college student so I really needed that money for groceries/valentines day so I'm glad I did this.

☀️Summary:☀️
- $SNDL being shorted
- They are now debt free, while others weed stocks are filled with debt. 
- SNDL has lots of potential and many plans of development
- +Weed (once fully legal📈)
- under valued, compare other weed stonks, most around 5b market avg and yes those are for known companies but who’s to say SNDL won’t grow, so far they’ve been making smart business decisions.
- This stock has actual real potential, long term goal of $10.


☀️Common Questions?:☀️

- ❓Why is cannabis Shorted❓
-Cannabis has been getting heavily shorted for quite some time because of legalization, shorts have made it very difficult for this life changing industry to flourish the way it should. 

-  ❓Is cannabis industry over rated❓
-No, cannabis stocks are overrated when they are 10b+ market cap before legalization and/or heavy revenues. Which is the case with some marijuana stocks. But $SNDL was well under 1b market cap, for a growing cannabis industry; this is highly undervalued. We are not saying $SNDL should be around the other popular mainstream cannabis stocks. But it should at least be higher 5b market cap.

- ❓Sndl is Canadian , legalisation is US❓-
-Yes, you don’t think being able to expand nd distribute to US markets will help to grow?

- ❓why was $Sndl preforming bad before❓
-1️⃣They had bad managment, the new ceo Zach will turn it around you can see in pics above. 2️⃣Marijuana industry wasn’t as recognized before. 3️⃣ They were faced with huge set backs, if you look at one of the articles below. They had 2 fires which resulted in huge loss of products, floods, humidity control issues, and leaks. Yet they managed to stay debt free❗️. This was all not in their hands and due to having a shit location and poor building management/control.4️⃣As I mentioned they had setbacks, major one was poor warehouse control and management which resulted in humidity issues that further caused mold in the warehouse/cannabis. This has all been resolved and they implemented a new manager.

- ❓cannabis industry has political issues❓
-well for starter, the marijuana industry is no longer going to have those political issues with the Biden administration hopefully pushing it forward. Also, regarding SNDL the stock is highly undervalued compared to other weed stocks. Which doesn’t make sense because yea they’ve had major setbacks but somehow they’re debt free. It’s a cannabis company that looks to be making smart business decisions plus the new ceo will make a positive change, we are not saying it’s the next canopy or are trying to promote it as the leading cannabis stock. But instead we are trying to show you a potential stock that can boom due to being undervalued. To add on, SNDL is heavily shorted which brings a possibility of a small squeeze. They have until June to keep their share price above $1 for 10days or it will get delisted. So far the price is heading in the right direction.

- ❓regarding questions about 1b market cap nd if it can reach 5b:❓Ok looking at SNDL market cap it’s currently at 1.3b and the company wasn’t even doing that well before because of major set backs I mentioned above, so you don’t think after having a new ceo, and making smarter business moves; that it’s possible for it to reach a 5b market cap, almost all cannabis companies are average round or close to 5b market cap, and none of them seem to be generating any high revenue, because cannabis is still under full legalization. And if you’re wondering what smart business moves SNDL made, well for starter they are debt free❗️while many/all other marijuana stocks are still piled with debt. SNDL is debt free after going through two fires that caused massive losses and constantly burning through cash, like all other cannabis stocks. Look at this article here: https://www.google.com/s/www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/  you can see most cannabis stocks aren’t generating any revenue and there all burning through cash and filled with debt except SNDL has no more debt❗️and here in this article: https://www.google.com/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-sundial-growers-planning-a-splashy-deal-2021-01-22%3 you can see how they are trying to possibly expand. so a $5b cap is quite realistic.

-  ❓Many people keep asking about its market cap at 1b❓ Lol u say it’s over valued at 1b? What makes you say that, is it because their not generating any high revenue or their burning through cash. Yet, all other cannabis stocks are faced with the same issue and not to mention they are all piled with debt except SNDL❗️If you’re basing your facts that it’s overvalued because of its revenue performance than you might as well say all cannabis stocks are overvalued because most if not all, are still burning through cash. And the top cannabis stocks you guys mention are Nowhere near a penny stock, which diminishes their entire purpose. The point of this post is to show a penny stock that can potentially boom due to being undervalued in comparison to others. Not trying to list the top leading cannabis stocks, which is what you guys keep mentioning.

- ❓How is $SNDL financials and revenue❓

  - [This article here talks about how they raised 600million cash and all their debt obligations are gone ](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/once-down-weeds-cash-strapped-174412731.html)

  - [Here you can see their financials is bad and their revenue is not high but it’s because they’re trying to shift into retail from wholesale, also in the article you can see multiple cannabis stocks burning through cash and have similar revenues but only SNDL is debt free ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/22/3-marijuana-stocks-that-could-fall-47-wall-street/)

  - [last article here you can see other cannabis stocks that burn through cash and have poor revenue but that the case with most if not all marijuana stocks as the industry is just beginning ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/)

  - I listed these two articles to show you how many different cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt. $SNDL’s revenue isn’t high just like all those cannabis stocks except $SNDL has no more debt. Those articles don’t contradict my post I am telling you that SNDL doesn’t have high revenue but all those other cannabis stocks don’t have high revenue either but yet they have 5b+ market caps. So there revenue position is the same as $SNDL burning through cash and not generating high revenue  $SNDL is debt free and now has 600mill cash at hand. Do you understand the advantage??? In that article you can see aurora cannabis and cronos are burning through cash and have debt!!! Yet there market caps are higher than $SNDL even tho SNDL wiped its debt and has 600mill cash. Most if not all cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt, because legalization still taking place....


  - They raised 600mill in cash and wiped out ALL their debt obligations. ANY logical person can see how beneficial this is. They raised 600mill to re-invest back in to the business!! Looking into the long term there is endless possibilities for this company they can have many upcoming catalyst. They can use this money for expansion, buying out a competitor, or the introduction of a new product. Which $SNDL has talked about multiple acquisitions, mergers or overall expanding the company.


- ❓regarding the questions about Canadian companies in the us market ❓-Well for starter how do you know that once US goes through full legalization they won’t accept Canadian companies to flourish. There’s already major Canadian companies expanding in the us, and you don’t think SNDL is capable of doing an acquisition with a us company or let alone expanding their product/name to the us. Even if they partially succeed in expanding to the Us, they can still be major players in the Canadian cannabis industry you’re talking about a growing 37mill population with 99% cannabis enthusiasts. SNDL has lots of potential to grow. Search up this article (sundial growers splashy deal-nasdaq)

I am no financial advisor DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I can’t provide you with all the info or predictions on whether this stock will rise or sink. I am quite bullish on this stock based on my reasons, but there are multiple sources online that can further elaborate on where this stock is heading.

8th grade research project: $NVDA,66,lhrf27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhrf27/8th_grade_research_project_nvda/,38,1613097792.0,"Swear to god if the automod removes this... 

Alright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. 

#Retard Analysis
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. 

#Expanding Business 
Looking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. 

* ""Launched the NVIDIA® EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter & Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters"". 
 
* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. 

* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. 

* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. 

* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PLTR autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.

#Red Hat
But the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   

#Semiconductor shortage easing
The world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. 

#Bear case
The only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.


#What the big money is doing

Increased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.

3% increase in institutional ownership from Q2 to Q3 2020

https://imgur.com/a/eGmb4cy

They are mostly buying more and some are trimming their positions slightly. Big bois are cool with it so you can be confident that ThE hEdGe FuNdS wOnT bUrN yOu 🤡🤡🤡.


#TA for mentally ill
Has been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.

Bumble's business model is garbo tbh.

Having women message first on dating sites is suboptimal, and we know they will never initiate unless the dude is over an 8. Also, you only have a 24-hour time limit to even respond to messages. Which means there is a limited time to get a match or strike up a conversation. They also got into a huge settlement with their boost which was found to be misleading their customers. You can read more about the Bumble Settlement here: https://www.bumbleboostsettlement.com/

 Dating apps have high turnover and cause burnout fast. Also, consider that Tinder and other dating apps like POF and OKCupid have higher name recognition and more market share, and you'll see why Bumble's growth is capped. Don't bother buying high IMO.

[TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook,73,lhr4ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhr4ld/tsla_pelosi_leaps_playbook/,76,1613097029.0,"You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

I like kitties but I am not into roaring.

I also check this site every day to see if any other [lawmakers are buying for additional confirmation.](https://senatestockwatcher.com/ticker.html?ticker=TSLA)",2021-02-12 04:30:29

$CLNE Super Bull Case,43,lhqmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhqmxz/clne_super_bull_case/,49,1613095737.0,CLNE Clean Energy Corporation is a GIANT sleeping bull just starting to wake up in my opinion. (Not financial advice just my opinion) The stock is up over 500% in the past year and there are good reasons why. The market cap as of now is $3 billion so it still is relatively small and has a lot of room to run. I know some people might think it’s already up 500% where is the room to run... I get it but if PLUG can go from around $1 to $65 for gods sake CLNE can make a huge run too. CLNE revenue last quarter was $70.89 million up from the previous quarter of $59.87. They are not profitable yet but close to being profitable. The earnings per share last quarter was -0.01. Not bad. Previous quarter’s EPS was -0.02. Earnings is in March and it is expected for the earnings to be 0.01 per share. They have scored multiple contracts and recently a major one with L.A County Metro. For the LA County Metro they will be supplying 47.5 million gallons of renewable natural gas. Clean Energy Fuels scores a five-year contract to supply renewable natural gas for the nation's largest transit bus fleet. Also analysts are bullish on CLNE. Tuesday February 3rd Shares of Clean Energy Fuels soared after the natural gas marketer and retailer received an initial rating of outperform with a price target of $17 from Credit Suisse. MarketBeat shows a consensus price target of $18.67. PLUG revenue was around $100 million last quarter and still not profitable. I think we will see profitability soon with CLNE. The Clean energy industry is just getting starting. I first bought in at around $12 and slowly added to original position. Let’s see what’s to come in the near future.,2021-02-12 04:08:57
tendies alert: semiconductor shortage,158,lhqmdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhqmdo/tendies_alert_semiconductor_shortage/,108,1613095700.0,"TL;DR: check out ON, TSM, TXN, ADI, MCHP, STM, NXPI

Hi y'all, if you are a nerd like I am, you should be aware that a lot of consumer electronics have been out of stock for months or having supply chain shortages (see: PS5, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs, phones, etc etc)

This is mostly attributable to COVID, but one of the sectors hit the hardest is semiconductor manufacturing. It has been dubbed the Chipocalypse: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html

the above is OLD NEWS (and you should know this unless you woke up from a coma yesterday)

NEW News just hit that Biden is going to do some EOs to alleviate this situation: 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage

I think semiconductor foundries and chip makers are severely undervalued because of the current crisis, so I'm going in hard. I saw a DD about $ON having low IVs so I went in a few days ago, but I think with this news I'm gonna double down.

The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. 

My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. 
TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.

Today I bring you an opportunity to make money once again. The $RBLX infinite money glitch. For those unaware Roblox is set to IPO soon. What does this mean? Unlimited money for your dick implants so you can finally satisfy your wife like her boyfriend does.

Step 1) Open position on Roblox after IPO

Step 2) Stock goes up, make money, and use money to purchase in-game currency in Roblox

Step 3) Absolutely steez out your Roblox avatar, while simultaneously increasing revenue for Roblox

Step 4) Roblox beats earnings estimates with increased guidance from new revenue and repeat steps 2-4 forever

EDIT: It is a direct listing, not an IPO, however that has no impact on the glitch. Direct listing just removes underwriting from the process.

Day Range: $208 - $221  
52 week low - $135  
Market Cap: $68bn

**At $68bn that gives DoorDash a larger market cap than the following companies:**

* Spotify ($SPOT)
* Palantir ($PLTR)
* Atlassian ($TEAM)
* Adidas ($ADDF)
* Workday ($WDAY)
* Autodesk ($ADSK)
* FedEx ($FDX)
* ....and $1 billion shy of having a larger market cap than Twilio ($TWLO)

**Lockup Expiration:**  
Looking at companies like Lemonade and Snowflake we can see that after an IPO and the employee stock lockup period ends, the markets tend to anticipate a pull back. For Doordash, this day is March 9th. There are some things that need to happen before the lockup is lifted however. DoorDash needs to be trading at 25% above IPO price for 5 days prior to this. The next one would be June 7, 2021.

With $DASH at the price it is today, hitting a high of $221, it's a safe bet to think that the lockup period will stand on March 9th. If the stock were to fall so drastically that the lockup period wouldn't go into effect....well you still win with puts because that means the stock fell \~$100 / share.

I have 25 puts for March 19, 2019 for a $170 strike. This cost me $21,817.50. I may add to this in the future, or buy more puts at a higher strike pending how the stock moves in the coming days / weeks.

I've read and become familiar with datadog, including it's last four quarters worth of results and their coming predictions for the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings report is coming out after close today.

If you're unsure about what datadog do - they are a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications.

The hit of the pandemic wasn't really an issue for them - sure, technology companies and cloud providers are tightening their belts, but when everything is moving towards home-working, there is a serious requirement for cloud monitoring and security when your business is becoming more de-centralized, a reality that creates more attack vectors for businesses.

This all points to good news for datadog, but they are still waiting for secure approval from federal level, which comes with quite the boost some cloud providers would be seeking.   

I have no doubt their revenue is probably about the level they predicted. A 5.3% increase from last quarter. The share price on the other hand has hit about 34% increase from the same time. The company is investing in rapid growth, with big spends in R&D. They're a great company and if you go long on this position then it will undoubtedly hit these numbers and above based on their GAAP, but at current I do not anticipate the earnings reports to shine anything that will justify this share price.",2021-02-12 03:59:13

They are up almost 20% over the last week. Cloudflare is a world-renowned cloud computing company that offers services from cyber-security to content-hosting. It IPO'd at the end of 2019, and is already up over 500% in the last 12 months. Cloud services are expanding at an extremely rapid rate, and it's one of the tech industries that has massively benefitted from Covid-19, considering the increase in demand for cloud computing resources due to people spending time at home all day.

Cloudflare Q4 earnings report is **tonight**. There has been some serious whale buy volume in anticipating the earnings jump \[[source](https://imgur.com/a/h7hMTO3)\]. Almost every stock with a heavy hand in cloud computing (esp Amazon, Google, Microsoft) have destroyed their Q4 earnings report. Cloudflare is the biggest CDN provider, and one of, if not the, biggest DDOS and bot protection provider. They have a massive hand in the market and serve millions of businesses, from small to ultra-large corporations. \[[source](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/cloudflare)\]

They have outperformed their anticipated earnings, and last report drew over any 11% uptick after the Q3 earnings statement. A solid earnings report tonight could draw an extremely strong uptick in price, and I'm betting on it. Positions: 2/12 $89 c, 2/12 $90, 6/16 c$110

**Ticker:** $DIS

**Market Cap:** 341.8 Billion

**Assets:** 201.5 Billion

**Subsidiaries:** Disney +, Pixar, Hulu, ESPN, FX, ABC, etc

First, Disney is a safe as fuck investment. It’s a blue chip and should be a part of your portfolio. But fuck portfolios, this is a casino, so why will Disney moon? Why the fuck does Disney need a DD? Well, I'm Long $DIS, but today will also make for a good earnings play. 

**Disney Plus.** Have you heard about it? Well, millennials with kids sure have. As the millenials start pumping out babies after 12 months of social distancing, they’ll quickly learn kids get bored easily, and fast. Disney Plus will be as big as Netflix in a few years, and will probably eclipse it for multiple reasons. They have a huge library that they own themselves, and the ability to have streaming premiers, etc. Not to mention the package with Hulu and ESPN. Netflix has a market cap of around **250 billion** with only **40 billion** in assets and 1.5 Debt-to-Equity vs Disney 0.7

Don’t get me wrong, I’m long Netflix too, but clearly $DIS is the better deal here when you consider their other revenue streams. The fucking rocketship that Disney Plus is has only just started getting priced in, and is where Netflix was 6-7 years ago, but with an accelerated course to get there since people already adopted streaming. They also own their own content and have been producing since their inception, and have a better moat than Netflix. Even if the revenue from Disney+ doesn't match Netflix, they'll be able to pull a bigger profit and recycle old IP. 

Oh, let's not get into sports. ESPN, Cricket, etc. Mickey already has his dirty paws in everything. More independent services to charge for. 

Their earnings have taken a hit from their parks and experiences being limited from COVID. But the vaccine is rolling out, and their peak profit from this is in the Summer, where COVID transmissibility tends to be low, and partying tends to be high. This will have a much less effect on earnings than predicted the parks get busier this year with vaccinated people ready to go HAM from a year of isolation. Their parks are operating at 35% capacity, but they aren't at capacity for the bulk of the year. Even if the parks take a significant hit this year, it won’t even be noticed as $DIS tears through hyperspace. Fuck the moon. We’re talking Star Wars^TM type intergalactic travel. 🚀


**Revenue Streams**

Media Networks: 28.4 Billion

Parks/Experiences: 16.5 Billion

Studio Entertainment: 9.64 Billion

Other: 17 Billion

**Earnings Play**

As for an earnings play, they report today. This is a casino. They’re still holding low considering the uncertainty with their parks, but park travel is low in the winter, and should have a low effect on earnings. But while kids were home, not in school, and causing a ruckus, Disney + subs increased dramatically over the Fall. Look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=disney%20plus) and notice the clear increase over Q4, probably fueled by the Mandalorian and the holiday classics people go nuts for.

Why a long-term short squeeze isn't possible,0,lhpkw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhpkw7/why_a_longterm_short_squeeze_isnt_possible/,46,1613092988.0,"Thinking about all the craziness with GameStop stock over the past month made me think about how this is a great example of a real life game theory with the prisoner's dilemma.

So what is the prisoner’s dilemma?

“The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.” (Investopedia)

Applying the prisoner’s dilemma to what happened with GameStop is relatively simple. The best-case scenario (based on the stated goal) is for everyone to work together and “hold the line”. This keeps the price of GameStop high and forces the hedge fund managers to lose money covering their shorts. On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is if no one buys or everyone sells their positions in a short period of time. This resorts in the shorts still being profitable for the hedge funds and ultimately the little guy has no impact on the market. Now what really happens, and what did, is that tons of people bought and held in the beginning, which is what shot the stock price to the moon. Now after about two weeks people started to bail, which represents the other two scenarios in the prisoner’s dilemma. Where half of the party rats out the other half. With GameStop this is represented by some people starting to sell. The early sellers make most or all the profits leaving those who hold long term with a mostly worthless stock.",2021-02-12 03:23:08

PANDEMIC PLAY!,27,lhpi8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhpi8y/pandemic_play/,30,1613092797.0,"So I’ve been watching $CLX for some time now.. and Iv finally entered a position yesterday. 
We’re still in the middle of this whole COVID thing and Lysol and other cleaning products have been going FAST at local super markets. $CLX is currently at a 10 month low for whatever reason after beating earnings.. It’s low volume and low IV. 
I personally went in on some 4/16 220C that are currently trading for .80! If this thing returns back to 210-220 range, those calls will easily quadruple. Clorox had a 52 week high at almost $240!

Here’s a statement from the recent earnings call! 

It was said:

On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double digits increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our Cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and, importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments.

I think it has a lot of upside potential!

EDIT* Proof of position.. I’m broke after buying $GME at $396 and this is all I have left LOL. I’ll add more once I get paid tomorrow

The SEC has been active in the ""popular rebellion"" trading inspired by Robinhood among other sites. This appears to be the only relevant petition for comments. This is unfortunate. Some argue that these traders represent individual investors. This is clearly untrue. Individual investors these days invest primarily through mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard's $7billion holdings) and are strongly negatively affected by the stock market declines attributed largely to increasing volatility driven by the ""popular rebellion"" traders.

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.",2021-02-12 03:03:48
The case for H&R Block (HRB),20,lhoz45,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhoz45/the_case_for_hr_block_hrb/,51,1613091424.0,"At the time of this writing, HRB is trading at $19.46. I am holding 100 shares @ $19.61, and preparing for a liftoff between now and April. Let me explain why.

H&R Block is one of the largest tax firms in the world. They specialize in assisting individuals and businesses with paying their taxes. Their target market is primarily young people (age 20-24) who aren’t familiar with paying their taxes. Sounds like a lot of you apes, right? 🦍 

Anyway, the US government is expecting to open the tax season on February 12th, which is tomorrow. Because of an unprecedented number of young traders entering the market this past year, capital gains taxes among H&R Block’s target market is expected to be extremely high. (AKA the 18 year olds on the subreddit who made $20,000 on GameStop and weed stocks.)

H&R Block has traded as high as $37 back in 2015, and I’m expecting it to top that in the next few weeks. Furthermore, it pays a dividend yield of 5.28%, so the boomers are also interested in it. In my view, we’re looking at a perfect storm for H&R Block, and the earnings from this tax season will likely be heftier than most people recognize. 

TL;DR : young people who made money trading stocks and don’t know how to pay taxes will go to H&R Block. Stonk goes up, everybody happy.",2021-02-12 02:57:04

This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. ""paper hands"" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right.

Some (RAD) Rite Aid DD and Updates,34,lhop5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhop5b/some_rad_rite_aid_dd_and_updates/,27,1613090673.0,"Hello WSB back with an update on my Rite Aid play.  Up 50% from when I entered my positions yesterday and held through the dip early.  I think we will continue to see upward movement through the end of the month after the earlier movement this week.  

I am posting this again today as people thought it may be too late yesterday, but today is a great time to get in.


**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


MORE PROMISING NUMBERS

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

**UPDATED INFO**

The biggest criticism I see of rite aid are its debt and the fact it is a drug store.  

As for the debt, I believe this is already priced in.  Even with the 3.5 billion in debt Rite aid is STILL UNDERVALUED BY A BILLION DOLLARS. 

As for rite aid being a drug store, they have recently partnered not only with HEB grocery but they also launched their telehealth to generate additional revenue. 


Tl;DR: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it’s STILL fundamentally undervalued.

BB/AMZN Speculation: Blackberry IVY for the automotive industry is just a cover. We are thinking too small.,1057,lhooz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/,308,1613090664.0,"175 million cars currently runs on BlackBerry QNX blah blah yada yada we’ve all read a hundred DDs on why BB is going to dominate the EV software market and IVY is gonna collect harvest boatloads of data which BB can sell for a pretty penny. 

But think about it. 

Like, wrinkly-brain think about it.

Amazon doesn’t build cars or sell car insurance so what the hell do they really want out of this Blackberry partnership?

The answer is drones. Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:

1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year 

2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles 

3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)

4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc (IVY)

Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as CEO of Amazon in Q3. The same Andy Jassy from this article about BlackBerry IVY:

“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

Blackberry IVY isn’t just some pet project for Amazon’s incoming CEO. It is quite possibly their MOST important project. Drone Delivery means that your Amazon Orders can get to you in MINUTES rather than days, and that they can come to YOU based on your GPS location instead of just your home or work address. 

Amazon’s plans for drone delivery is no secret, but always seemed like a far-flung future kinda thing. Until now. 

There must be a reason why Jassy of all people was chosen to take the helm at Amazon. What can he bring to Amazon that he isn’t already bringing from his current position as head of AWS?

TLDR: Drones and Amazon’s domination of urban airspace

The Snakes and the Wall the Fish Built - Path to the Moon Part 4,19,lhoko4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhoko4/the_snakes_and_the_wall_the_fish_built_path_to/,17,1613090333.0,"Once upon a time a bunch of Snakes decided a **Game** was **going to** have to **Stop**.

A clever deep sea fish convinced a bunch of **Retarded Fish** to **build a wall** to stop those pesky Snakes from stopping the game.

The **Snakes did not like this** one bit, they could not have walls being built without their permission, so **they did all they could to bring it down**. First they stopped the Fish from getting more bricks. Then they moved bricks between themselves which made the wall smaller. The Snakes were crafty motherfuckers and they had been **playing games with walls for a very long time.** This led to **an impasse** where the Retarded Fish would build up the Wall while the Snakes would tear it down. It looked like this could go on for a very long time.

Along came a Snail, a very clever Snail and in this reality the Retarded Fish listened to his idea. It was hard for them at first, being Retarded Fish but eventually they listened and **they took their own wall down** at his advice.

Suddenly a magical thing happened\*\*.\*\* The **Snakes thinking they had won** stopped moving stones between each other. They **had no wall to tear down.** They gave each other pats on their scaly backs. However the **Snakes** now **knew** that **the wall** the **fish** had tried to **build was popular**. They knew that the **fish might try again** to build the wall. The Snakes knew that if the fish should build the wall again it would be **better for them to make some prophets off of it**.

See the **Snakes had no interest** in the wall **the first time** it was being built, they had **an interest in taking it down**. Once the wall had been taken down and their losses recouped they had **no business in seeing the Game Stop completely**. Snakes like building walls even more than Retarded Fish.

**Now the Snakes had a vested interest in seeing the wall built**, as they could easily cover their positions from a low level, their was **nothing to stand in the way of the Retarded Fish.** Magically after following Snails advice, **the Snakes were now helping** the Retarded Fish build the Wall. The Retarded Fish went and got more Fish. Family Fish, Friend Fish. **Every Fish and Every Snake joined in** building this wall.

Each day **the Wall grew higher** and higher and very quickly it **reached the moon**. The Snakes were on the Moon, the Retarded Fish were on the Moon, all their Family and Friend Fish were on the Moon. **Everyone now had an interest in seeing the wall built. There was nothing to take it down.** They all lived happily ever after Rich as Fuck on the Moon.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, nor is it a true story. Unfortunately Retarded Fish are **too stupid to know good advice when they see it**. Too close they are to read the writing on the wall. It says ""stand back, stop holding and **do what ever the fucking Snail tells you**."" So simple it could have been to reach the moon but for the stubbornness of Retarded Fish.

I am joycey-mac-snail

My name is **LEONIDAS**

**I AM KING** 

**I AM YOUR WIFE'S BOYFRIEND**

When this is over you will beg me to take her from you. You are all **Kings and Queens in your own right**  but you don't act like it. You act like Retarded Fish.

&#x200B;

Edit: TLDR for you fucking retards. **NONE OF YOU SHOULD BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE STOCK MARKET IF YOU CAN'T READ A FUCKING CHILDRENS STORY.**

It's simple, bring the wall down and the Snakes will stop tearing it down. When you start building again, the Snakes will be helping you all to build it high.

High enough to reach the moon.

Has been on a constant uphill trend for the past month.

Up 10.68% this week and 44.65% this month. 

ViacomCBS has its investor day on February 21st and just like Disney+ I expect them to increase share price exponentially. 

For those who don’t know ViacomCBS - VIAC is the stock for the new releasing streaming service Paramount+ (I know “AnOtHeR sTrEaMiNg SeRvIcE”, but this is different hear me out) 

Paramount+ will include mega Titans combing to create one of the top streaming services in the world. 

Viacom includes - Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, ⭐️BET, C M T, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network.

CBS has - CBS All-Access, Showtime, and live Sports & News. (CBS sponsored the super bowl this year, it also host the PGA WorldTour, March madness, and the biggest college football games out of the SEC)

On top of that Pluto Tv has also joined them. Pluto TV Provides television to lower income house holds and is free television that makes its revenue off of ads.

Paramount Pictures has a huge collage of movies and they also own 49% of Miramax which adds hundreds and even up to thousands of other options. These movies are timeless from Transformers, The Godfather, Wolf of Wallstreet, Mission Impossible, Star Trek, etc. 

On top of that Paramount was a huge part of creating Netflix and Hulu originals we all love. (13 Reasons Why, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Defending Jacob)

The stock has only been moving up the past couple months and after their investor day I expect them to make a killing and finally place themselves up there with Netflix and Disney+

Investor day - February 21st

Earnings - February 24th 

Paramount+ streaming release date - March 4th

This streaming outlet is in a whole different position then all the rest. It’s live TV / Sports mixed in with timeless TV shows and movies. I personally believe if they live up to their word this could be revolutionary and also could put the Nail in the coffin for Cable TV.

JUST WAIT

Once these companies get uplisting onto the NASDAQ , and become available on Robinhood, a lot of people will begin to realize the staggering revenue difference between US operators and Canadian ones that already exists. As we seem to be trending toward legalization in the US, time is slowly running out to get in but it’s far from too late.

There will be a pullback in the sector as a whole soon as the hype dies down again which will make the opportunity even JUICIER.

My favorites are the etf MSOS (only thing available on Robinhood that gives users a portion of US companies), which holds operators like TCNNF, GTBIF (first public offering was just bought by blackrock for $100 million), CURLF, and GRAMF (a Jay-Z and Rihanna backed company that off the star power alone may have a ton of room to grow)

Because it did and no doubt there was a great bit of excitement. 

But if you look at what's going on this week as far as volume goes, it has gone down. It seems like the stock is going to move much more slowly with a lot less investors with interest. Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon. 

Those who are holding see a short squeeze as on the horizon. They see dollar signs. But how realistic is that really? We keep getting information that the next report is around the corner and the shorts will be revealed as being in a bad position. 

It hasn't happened. It may not happen. And many of you are slowly losing interest. 

This subreddit is called WallStreetBets for a reason. We make bets. Very rarely does the great group hold shares for a long period of time. Those of you who have Gamestop options expiring soon probably are sweating. And you should be. 

The point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. 

The long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM.

Stock Trading for Dummies 101,644,lhog1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhog1u/stock_trading_for_dummies_101/,190,1613089977.0,"Take your profits and get the fuck out of these high volatility stocks. It’s fine to ride the train up, but please for the love of god, set a stop limit or a trailing stop. I’ve been apart of this community for over a year but just started investing. I’m going to give the new people some advice.

1. Research the company and see if their valuation matches the current share price. 

2. Pay close attention to all the comments on whatever you’re investing in. It’s not hard to tell the real people from bots. Most bots will tell you to hold the fucking bag, while they run off with your money. 

3. If it’s too good to be true, it usually is. I’m not telling anyone how to spend there money, but please only invest in these high volatility stocks with the future of the share possibly tanking. 

4. Don’t let high volatility stocks take up a majority of your portfolio. I’ve seen advice where people say one stock shouldn’t take up more than 10-20% of your portfolio. 

5. This one is a big one. If you see people hyping the fuck out of a certain stock, there is a good chance there will certainly be a sell off once people start seeing huge profits. It don’t hurt to take profit and buy in at a lower price. Definitely use risk management to make sure every trade is worth it. 

6. Don’t day trade, you will lose more money than you make in the long run. If you plan on investing short term, have a strategy. Invest in options that have good deltas and IV. These are certainly risky but if you like gambling on shitty shilled stocks, this one is for you. 

7. If you want to go long, invest in ETFs. Sure these will see lower gains, but over time the gains will be decent. If you want to go long on equities, make sure you love the damn stock. So many people see red and sell, this is fine if you’re using risk management and need to exit but horrible if you’re trying to make money without a lot of capital. 

8. Learn, Learn, and Learn. Learn from every mistake you make and better yourself for the next trade. I was a bag holder with GME, I lost about $600. Know which indicators lead to the stock moving in a certain directions. You think it will breakout, what will the catalyst be? Always strive to learn more than the previous day. 

TLDR: Trust your instincts, not random people on Reddit, who a majority are bots and shills. You can definitely learn from people on here, but you’re picking a needle from a haystack. You’re here to make money for your future, other people are wanting to fill their pockets, so expect misinformation. Take everything with a grain of salt.",2021-02-12 02:32:57

"DD- Valens is a MUCH better weed stock fundamentally than SunDial you retards. Highly undervalued. Epic growth, entering Australia, profitable, strong balance sheet, tons of cash",84,lho969,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lho969/dd_valens_is_a_much_better_weed_stock/,120,1613089465.0,"VLNCF :  I asked people yesterday to explain why SunDial is the move given their horrific financials and performance. The answer was ""we smoke weed and its a momentum play"". Ok, but why not go with a company that has even more future growth ahead, already profitable, fortress balance sheet, cash out the ass, and great marketing ? When you make moves on an undervalued company, you get a huge margin of safety compared to being randomly retarded.

Valens is focused on oil based products and extraction. They do the extraction for all your fav companies including Tilray and Sundial. As those companies grow, they use Valens more for extraction. Valens benefits from everyone's rise as their premier oil extractor.

(Valens) (VLNS on TSX) VLNCF's revenue is 98M with market cap of 220M; OGI’s revenue is 80M with market cap of 1.3B; SNDL’s revenue is 97M with market cap of 4.4B. Thus, VLNCF’s SP should be between $10 and $35.

How does that make sense?

105 Million is short term assets vs 22 M in short term liabilities and only 30 mill in long term. Clearly got cash. In fact too much cash since investors were upset recently with the company raising more money. They believe it was unnecessary and the stock price dropped. I believe they did it to acquire a key partner. When this announcement hits, it will all make sense.

Valens. 88% yearly earnings growth according to 8 analysts. Current price 2.10$ cad, analysts target is 3.61. Recently fell down because they raised more money they didnt need.

Simply Wall St rates them 91% undervalued with a target price of 27.40$. That seems pretty excessive to me though. My target price is 6-10$, which would make it only a 1 billion $ market cap.

They are entering the Australian market which is ripe. Read about their plans in their presentation: [https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/](https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/)

Insider buying: Last 6 months, the ceo, directors and board of directors made 6 purchases, and 0 sales.

The stock price is currently at a low so you get a huge margin of safety since you are not buying hype, but are buying undervalued. If there were options on this baby I will get them right away. Since there is not, I got stock.

Summary

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.
Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.

This estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.

Key Point - Catalysts

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

The Business

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

Home Financing

Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.
Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world.
Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.
Home Sale and Search

Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.
Auto & Personal Financing

Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.
Media

Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.
Services & Technology Development

Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.
Recent Acquisitions

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

Management

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

Financials and Growth

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr

I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

Product Channels

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)
The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

Current Market and outlook

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Which Cannabis Stocks?,31,lhn9q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhn9q8/which_cannabis_stocks/,73,1613086787.0,"Relatively new to WSB thread so be gentle. I'm writing this to give everyone some research I've done on the pot industry. The purpose here is to educate and make smart decisions with your money. Whether that be long term growth or just pumping everything for the home run to the moon, you do you. Just make money folks.

We all know the cannabis industry is on the brink of legalization. There are so many companies out there. Some will survive and some won't. The overall goal is to deep dive into this to figure out which companies have an established footprint and the best chance to become the industry leaders (think of the AMZN or AAPL of the pot industry).

Anyway, here are some picks I've researched:

**$MJ - ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF**If you're not interested in trying to pick big winners but want exposure to the industry, MJ is probably the number one most active fund that spreads their portfolio out all over. Top holdings can be found here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings)

**$PLNHF - Planet 13 Holdings Inc**  
Cannabis company based out of Nevada. For those who have been to Vegas, they have the largest dispensary in the world. Not only do they have an established footprint in retail, but they have the ability to expand and deploy and already successful business model with a $1.6B market cap.

**$CXXIF - C21 Investments**  
Competitor to Planet 13 Holdings in NV. Many Cannabis ETFs are continuing to purchase more shares since this is company is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. They have large amounts of free cash and recently brought in some high profile investment managers.

**$TLRY - Tilray**  
Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company that recently announced a $3.9B merger with Aphria ($APHA) to become the world's largest production and distribution company in the industry. They've also agreed to start exporting to the UK, giving them access to a much larger customer base.

**$TCNNF - Trulieve Cannabis Corp.**  
\*\*One of the top performing cannabis companies in the United States. They recently opened a third dispensary in Jacksonville, FL, bringing their total footprint to 73 locations in Florida. Similar to Planet 13, this company has most of their presence on the east coast.

**$CRON - Cronos Group**  
Cronos Group engages in the production and distribution of pot. I consider this one of the safest bets since it based by Altria, the tobacco giant that holds 45% of the company. They've posted consistent, solid earnings and continue to look into lab grown opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient.

TL;DR - These are some of the most popular weed stocks that offer you idiots to expose yourselves to the legalization of marijuana. They have the best chance to continue massive growth as opposed to picking the next penny stock.

Edit: had to edit $C21 to correct ticker $CXXIF. This one is the only one that didn't have a massive pullback today.",2021-02-12 01:39:47

This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. 

**Introducing MorphoSys:**

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.

**The numbers:**

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.

**Conclusion:**

MorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.

GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.,96,lhmw52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhmw52/gme_was_a_game_weed_is_an_artificially_inflated/,222,1613085730.0,"I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

That's my two cents!",2021-02-12 01:22:10

Why hedge funds should fear $AMC & why their trolls will post here,263,lhm7ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm7ic/why_hedge_funds_should_fear_amc_why_their_trolls/,214,1613083775.0,"TL/DR:  **November 10, 2021 Opening day for Ghostbusters Afterlife**

I'm not one for surprises so I put it right up there in the title as a big FU to all those betting against AMC right now.

I'd like to make something abundantly clear. AMC is is not going anywhere. Not only will they weather this storm and come out on top but there are companies like Sony and Columbia that are *banking on* the existence of a Box Office to recoup their investments in silver screen flix. I guarantee that right now there is Peter Venkman merchandise already sitting in warehouses waiting to hit the market (and likely gamestop stores, lol).

Now I'm not goig to sit here and do your research about Thanksgiving release date movies and Christmas etc... but you can bet that the entire movie industry is looking for COVID to be over just as much as the travel industry who's buying up island destination properties.

For everyone and anyone who's negative with AMC I'm wondering why on earth they'd take a loss versus waiting till the summer when this stock will easily exceed $20/share (IMHO of course). I see no reason to concede shares back to those who shorted them simply on principle.

If you'd like to do your own research about AMCs financials I suggest posts like [this one][https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lctc6u/i_cant_believe_how_many_people_are_more_retarted/]. While I can seem to find it, someone here had stats on what AMC makes off of MoviePass alone. Let's not let the media con us here. 

HOLDING STRONG.

Having said this, I wish everyone here good luck and good fortune and I will most definitely see you in-person @ Ghostbusters

Both of these stocks would see 20% gains then trade sideways before they got popular, now they dump every morning. Chill tf out seriously.

Edit: “BuT i’M tAkInG pRoFiT” you’re not just taking profits, the retail market is clearly scared and is dumping. I take profits every day on SPACs and rarely see dumps as awful as this. Stop sharing your tickers, popularity is the enemy (unless you want your beautiful stonk to literally implode.)

Carvana Ooh Na-Na: The WeWork of Used Automobiles,47,li5yaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5yaf/carvana_ooh_nana_the_wework_of_used_automobiles/,56,1613142500.0,"Profile:

We're here to talk about Carvana. You probably heard of it and your friend Jeff who recently bought his Subie WRX off Carvana won't stop telling all his friends how seamless the process was. For those who don't know;  Carvana performs almost all the functions a physical dealer would offer: buying and selling cars, accepting trade-ins, and financing purchases except they're strictly an online-only used-car retailer. With so many online used car e-commerce choices and alternatives; Carvana's advantage is that they make their process as contactless as possible and they take away the hassle of haggling with a sleazy salesman. Carvana does not allow their customers to test drive the vehicle before they purchase but they do offer a 7 day return policy for any reason with some caveats. Carvana will deliver your purchase for free if you're within 75 miles of its physical location or they will charge you anywhere from $250-$1000 by a 3rd party delivery company. One of their gimmick is that they have physical car vending kiosks in 24 locations where customers can use a token to pick up their car like one of those old gumball machines you used to see as a kid.

Valuation:

&#x200B;

[Stock Price](https://preview.redd.it/b3tidam2vzg61.jpg?width=1519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18c57488f752cb434aa9a73b3dde77d57cfbf9b8)

CVNA was trading about $80-$100 a share pre-covid and reached as low as $22 during the peak of the pandemic. CVNA IS now trading at its ATH hovering around $290-$300 a share. They have a market cap of $49.74B which is bigger than notable online e-commerce giants such as $CHWY($43B), $EBAY($42B), $W($29B), $KMX($20B) and $ETSY($27B). Carvana have been consistently losing money and have yet to turn a profitable quarter. They lose approximately $1500 on every car sold last year, taking overhead costs into account. The company is being evaluated like a Tech SAAS company but it's really a WeWork for cars.

[Financials](https://preview.redd.it/wks9vxvyuzg61.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd4168d9a3cb6e2cd32b0a3588d5f8a54d61b1c6)

Economy:

You might've already heard that used car prices have been going up due to the constraints of manufacturers producing new cars coupled along with people having extra money from not going on vacation and also the additional income from the government's stimulus checks. This means Carvana is making a higher premium when they sell but they're also paying a lot more to attain inventory. The purchased cars will sit in inventory and will get continuously markdown until they are sold. In order to make space, Carvana will even sell at narrow to negative margins just to keep churning through inventory. With the influx of demand, it is impossible for quality control and customer service to keep up with the momentum of increasing sales. Take a look at their BBB rating of 1.4/5 with 882/1385 complaints coming from the past year. Tech companies are allowing their employees to work from home and cars are becoming less of a necessity unless you're in the suburbs. Chances are if you're looking for a car, you'll wait for the market prices to come back to normal and continue to use your ol faithful 2011 Honda accord or 2012 Ford Focus as there is really no rush with sheltering in place still in effect.

Shady Practice:

Carvana is family owned and is being run by Ernest Garcia II and his son Ernest Garcia III. Ernest Garcia II is the majority stake holder of Carvana and played a part as a straw borrower in a real estate scandal back in 1990 with Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loans. He is also the owner and chairman of DriveTime which is a company that specializes in selling used vehicles with their demographic being  customers who can only afford cars with sub-prime loans. Ernest then went to start Carvana as a subsidiary of Drive Time which is basically Drive Time but for millennial and gen z because who doesn't want to pick up their vehicle from a vending machine right? Carvana is not a used car marketplace, its a bank that preys on unexpecting victims by deceiving them into loans they cannot afford. The Garcias were also sued for insider trading when CVNA stock was trading at its low in the height of the pandemic. Stock prices fell during Covid and they took advantage of the artificial stock price and offered shares for sales to their private investors even though they were not in dire need for money.  The Garcias knew the stock would rebound as they have full disclosure of the health and financials of the company, and were not facing a liquidity issue of any sort. Fast forward to now with CVNA sitting its ATH, Ernest Garcia II have been dumping his shares starting at the end of October and have been steadily offloading over 2 billion dollars worth of shares.

&#x200B;

[Recent Insider Trades](https://preview.redd.it/y4b1u9q4g2h61.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8e648e3b4c4e09a825b075452004a96f8306ef1)

TLDR; CVNA is a shady bank disguised in the form of a used car e-commerce. The owner have a history of engaging in white collar crimes. The company have not been profitable but they obtain an absurd evaluation compared to their peers. Take a look at insider trading and you can see that the owner have been dumping his shares.

Summation:

Buy your Puts for its upcoming earnings or whatever date you feel comfortable but beware this POS stock is being backed by the likes of Wells Fargo and Citi Group for those juicy sub prime loans and who knows who else the Garcias have on their payroll. I didn't even get into the topic of their competitors such as KMX, VRM, Lotz but yeah do your own research instead of listening to some stranger on the internet. Peace.

Edit: Ernest Garcia III sold 6.8 Mill shares since the end of Oct and coincidentally he filed his form 13G today and it states he has 16 Mill shares outstanding which is 18% of CVNA shares. That means he dumped about 30% of his position since the end of October.
