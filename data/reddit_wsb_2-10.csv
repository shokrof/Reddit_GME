No more GME threads....Please,0,lg5cba,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5cba/no_more_gme_threadsplease/,7,1612912297.0,"Dearest Tards,

While you have your breakfast of glue covered crayons, I’d like you to hear my suggestion. 

My girlfriends husband is in this sub and all he’s been doing this past weeks is reading the GME threads and claiming to know exactly what the price of GME ought to be. He’s never visited yahoo finance, and doesn’t even know what an investor relations section is. He listens to Robinhood Snacks podcast which is where he gets all his stock advice from. 

The GME thread is all he is counting on, and it’s giving him an unrealistic expectation that this play is a “sure thing” rather than realizing it’s one of the riskiest bets currently available on the market. 

What’s even more retarded, him and his boys club can not stop publicly announcing every single thought thats on their mind, which means every single player on Wall Street can see exactly how to manipulate these apes. 

The GME thread made sense last week when it got filled 4 times with 100k comments (the limit), but today, it’s an invitation to advertise you’re retardedness and it does more harm than good. 

If newbies need a GME thread to ask questions on, well guess what, every fucking question has already been answered if you just use the fucking search bars. This subreddit is very well organized and we don’t need an extra retarded thread. 

TLDR: no more GME thread. It’s an invitation to coordinate and let’s HF see exactly what you are thinking.",2021-02-10 01:11:37

Unlike some people, I didn't throw my savings into GME or any of the other meme stocks. I put in a few hundred dollars when GME was at 30 and left it there. I'm in no scary financial situation, as a college student I have no mortgage, no giant financial obligations. I've always been an incredibly frugal person and I don't care about getting the huge payday that a lot of you guys are dreaming of.

But I want blood.

I'm sick of all of these Wall Street fuckers getting away with all of the shit they pull. I grew up getting shit on by many privileged assholes who didn't have to work for shit, so maybe I'm just a bitter person. Maybe I'm sick of feeling like all my hard work (Putting in ungodly study hours, doing extra work for ungrateful teachers just to boost my grade a fraction of a whole percent while these privileged fucks could cheat and lie their way through school) is for naught when these hedge fund bitches cry and whine for mommy government to take care of them and get everything handed to them on a silver platter. Or maybe it's just my optimism that makes me want to believe that a normal petson can make a change for this world. I want to help people. I want my life to mean more than than just being a grain of sand in an unfeeling world.

He says that heads over there have been in contact with ""an American company called Cresco and Medmen"" believe it or not, to Merge/acquire for their shipping/brick & mortar stores once USA laws loosen up.

No more info than that really but the way I look at it (very excitedly), is that This would be Altria's big US play as Cresco had the cultivation, multi state licenses, but most importantly the supply chain via their wholesale strategy, and MedMen has the brick & mortar locations plus licenses.

We all know the old JV Cronos has with MedMen (MMEN [CNSX exchange], (which my buddy had no clue about)

$CGC - A goliath on their last legs.,104,lg4qkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4qkd/cgc_a_goliath_on_their_last_legs/,98,1612910591.0,"Hello all,

I will keep this post really simple. Canopy is a weed company in Canada that has lost money for the past 2 years after being semi-acquired by their parent company Constellation Brands. **Canopy is worth 17 billion dollars despite never producing a profit.**

Canopy has burned 1 billion dollars of direct cash burn over the past year and invested roughly another 1 billion in United States and Canadian businesses. These investments have amount to 1.9 goodwill and a horrible cash position at 673m.

&#x200B;

[Sept 30th](https://preview.redd.it/nwnon28ungg61.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4cbe3bd3bae43ca3b36673ace4e81af09cff3a1)

Canopy reported earnings today and stated that they have 1.5B in cash and cash equivalents, a loss of .39 billion (hilarious wording or $390 million) at the end of the quarter today. They have not uploaded their current balance sheet to SEDAR.

So they either have less investments or spent another 170 million in direct cash. Putting us at around 500 million in direct cash.

Hidden in today's earnings/press release -

*As additional consideration for the assets being transferred and the termination of the royalty agreement, Canopy Growth will make a cash payment to CRC of $115 million and issue an aggregate of 3,750,000 commons shares to CRC.*

Canopy will need to spend another 115 million and dilute shareholders to divest from another horrible Canadian business they acquired back in 2018 or whatever. This will hit the books next Q as Canopy Rivers has to vote/agree to that consolidation of capital.

From there, we have $500 million - $115 from this settlement = $375 million in direct cash after this transaction set up for next quarter, and projected cash burn from operations at another $100 million. **To be fair, the CEO has been cutting costs and it is all over the press releases about their efforts.**

Either way, they are at to be fair $275 million in direct cash and 1.2 billion in investments going into next quarter. **They are going to have to raise capital.**

\----

Topic change, well Canopy is in a growth sector. Sales must be booming in Canada, with a population of 35 million people! Yea well, they were. In November, it actually started to decline.

&#x200B;

\---

Okay, so what about Constellation helping out Canopy. Well If you look at the actual agreement, Constellation extended the payment tranche out to November 2023. So they hold the option to deliver 5 billion dollars to Canopy by November 2023. That's amazing flexibility for Canopy, right?! Yea you would think so, but the reason it was extended is directly related to Constellation's balance sheet right now.

Constellation's last Q:

&#x200B;

[They have 152 million on the books right now. ](https://preview.redd.it/bckpgtjmqgg61.png?width=2161&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06aac3dff38aa251ec2adaf74b82debfb8a92a)

Now, no one is doubting Constellation's ability to raise cash. They have immense liquidity, but if you actually look at their balance sheet. They have 10 billion in debt. They can either provide shares to Canopy and royally fuck over current STZ shareholders, or take on debt to provide it. **The deal is going to get restructured.** They will never provide 5 BILLION dollars to a company that can turn a profit.

Options Chain:

There's my position. I am all in bitches. Weed cannot go up forever. The company is worth 17 billion dollars. STZ is not going to provide 5 billion dollars to a company that already accumulated 1.9 billion in goodwill, will need more cash to fund US legalization, and cannot even turn a profit.

# This is for those who are on loss, are not selling and are waiting for the squeeze 400$+ either to moon or cover your losses.

As you have have noticed the new reports are out, it may seem that the 120% is out of the table but apes still have a chance.

# This will require work and dedication for those involved.

IF the numbers apes have are any indication to go by apes still have a chance.

Lets talk some numbers:

The reports are of a 78.46% short interest, yet apes can make some interesting math with other numbers.

The  Shares Outstanding is of **69.75M** this is the reported total number of shares in GME this takes into account all shares including those of the company itself and private.

Before the report  **61M** shares were being shorted, this was  at 35$ a share.

according to the Bloomberg terminal that is what professionals use to invest it has now around **21M** or more shares being shorted (**I BELIEVE ITS MUCH MORE AT THIS POINT**). This number surely has changed to a bigger number over the week.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rrwhus9eylg61.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be3d9b604c2426d44e2604e59d93299b121c432

# if APE can read keep going...

# The graph below is not 100% accurate as this info varies from source to source (you may have noticed this)

This is the max pain theory, what this graph tell us is that with the stock at 70$ or lower most owners stand to lose, meaning there are more positions at that point and higher for buyers. As you can see in red is the majority of the PUT or shorts. This can also mean that most people would be profiting at the 120$ or higher share price. And hedgies will be bleeding again at 120$

**Moar numbers for apes...**

As of **today**, GameStop's [Institutional Ownership](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/InstitutionalOwnership/GME/Institutional-Ownership/GameStop) is **87.86%**.  This number seems to vary from many sources.

# THE PLOT THICKENS

# The outstanding% can be as high as  143.68%

according to the Bloomberg terminal which usually the most accurate place to look at.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ux549f3jylg61.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8e5d5f8595a00a655f8b9037a3fd282afe5b89

&#x200B;

At the same time it reports a FLOAT of 72%... this mean 72% of the shares are open to the market.

This can only mean that the outstanding% is being manipulated by many maneuvers which surely includes the interest short % and other factors. This tells us that HFs are inflating the outstanding% by many different means, this can mean that the FLOAT is also inflated.

If they have inflated the outstanding so much to 143.68% it makes difficult for then to cover the 78.46% interest. In fact it seems like a very hard task without having to BUY IT HARD!

&#x200B;

# NOW TO THE PLAN!

We need to grow the value above the max pain. Hitting around 120$ will possible trigger another big growth and squeeze!

&#x200B;

# BUT APE IS BROKE APE HAVE NO MOAR MONEY!

&#x200B;

Apes this movement have received global coverage, what I investigated is that the biggest growth in value for GME happened during the time #GAMESTOP and  #GME were trending on twitter.

Apes need to make twitter accounts and make the movement noticeable for the news again.

# APES DO IT!

# THIS WORKS!

# RECAPITULATING

OUTSTANDING% is OVER 143% and the Shorts are 78.46% this means they are in a difficult position to cover their shares, even if with an inflated FLOAT, [ortex](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/NYSE/GME/short_interest) reports a float of 45% which may or not be more accurate than the current inflated float on Bloomberg. According to the MAX PAIN, if apes grow the stock to 120$ HEDGIES WILL BLEED AND HAVE TO START COVERING! THIS WILL TRIGGER ANOTHER SQUEEZE!

&#x200B;

# THE MARKET CLOSED AT  50.31, GETTING TO 120$ IS REALISTIC IF APES GO ON THE ATTACK!

Disagreeing short interest reports for GME: proof of market manipulation?,2615,lgkea2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgkea2/disagreeing_short_interest_reports_for_gme_proof/,427,1612954849.0,"I've been following GME today since I have read some DDs on the hedge funds allegedly manipulating the market, but I think we might now have hard proof that they indeed are doing it.

When the market closed at 4pm people there were immediately links showing GME to have a 41.95% short interest from more than one website including MarketWatch. I don't know whether it was legitimate users or bots posting them. Meanwhile, Finra had no new results and were still showing the old short interest value for some reason.

Now, Finra has finally updated and came up with a 78.46% short interest, definitely more expected since it's very reasonable to think that at least some hedgefunds have not covered their shorts.

What interests me about this difference of almost double is that it seems to speak of obvious market manipulation from the hedge funds. They must have paid off the earlier websites to publish a false 41.95% result. How else could you possibly spin it?

INO...Beat down, heavily shorted for no reason and rumor of super catalysts. Still cheap and I think its about to moon. May save us from Covid but treated like a nobody. 
AMC....Of coarse, I highly doubt this company will go bankrupts. However I don't see anyone going to thearters this year. However its ripe for a takeover bid and thats why I'm buying in.
NIO....who doesnt love NIO. Nio coming to America would definitely be a challenger to Tesla. At 62 bucks, undervalued.
Workhorse...Lots of potential for this heavily shorted for no reaosn mom and pop vanlife company. I'm all for them challenging Ford and GM.
GSAT and NOKIA.....underrated and undervalued. I'm all in on GSAT Tomm. Nokia is working hard for that 5g. I think they will be way higher by 2022.

Now I've been an off-an-on customer of Papa John's for years and actually enjoyed their food but I don't think anyone can deny that the overall quality has been going down since big Papa was forced to step down.

Currently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I’ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we’ll see a rebound. So I’ll keep holding

Position: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too

Edit: stop telling me to sell. I’m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake

Edit 2: to the guy who said “AMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat” but who’s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less


EDIT3: **Were going up after hours +2.18%** this is it boys *and girls*, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $420.69, here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-02-10 02:11:10

Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).

They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

One day a very clever fish convinced a bunch of retarded fish to buy tickets for this meal and hold on to them which increased the price exponentially. The retarded fish could then sell the tickets back to the Snakes making a profit. 

Soon enough all the other fish in the sea heard about this Game and came to help. But by then it was too late, the price of a meal ticket was more than any little fish could afford.

The Snakes seeing this plan had succeeded in almost bankrupting them did a cunty spineless move and sold tickets between themselves to make the price of a ticket go down, so the retarded fish couldn’t put them out of business.

The retarded fish were obstinate and they continued to hold onto their meal tickets despite the price going down. ever so slowly, ever so painfully as many of the fish who got in late lost money and sold off their tickets. 

Some retarded fish thought they could make the price go up again by buying more but this was ineffectual as the activity of the Snakes was too much and more and more fish each day were giving up and selling their tickets to make some cash back and feed their fishwives and retarded fish children.

Silly fish thought a smart snail watching from the sidelines, if only the retarded fish could see that if they stopped buying more tickets and let the big fish who bought lots of tickets sell one at a time, the price would lower so more fish could buy even more tickets. Eventually the Snakes wouldn’t have any tickets to sell between themselves.   

The smart snail offered to help the retarded fish defeat the Snakes by delivering a clever strategy for success. “Go away crazy snail, that would never work,” said the retarded fish. “We don’t want the Snakes out of business we just want to buy tickets.” Stupid retard fish they thought the game was only about buying and holding tickets.

If only the retarded fish would stop sending each other memes and sucking each other’s dicks all day they might actually take over the Big Meal Business, if only they could see that it was them who had all the numbers they needed to swarm the Snakes and take all the tickets from them and their would be nothing the Snakes could do about it in time.

Poor Retarded Fish, thought the smart snail, guess they’ll never learn, I guess now they’ll always be Poor Retarded Fish. (sigh)

\- On February 1, 2021, in the patent infringement case, Ironburg Inventions Ltd. v. Valve Corp, the jury unanimously found that Valve Corp infringed Ironburg’s controller patent and awarded Corsair’s subsidiary Ironburg (a subsidiary of SCUF) over $4 million

&#x200B;

**My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)**

**-** I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.

\- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. **The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.** Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. 

\- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators.

Aphria/Tilray Merger,1035,lg5lq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5lq3/aphriatilray_merger/,405,1612913032.0,"Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.

This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.

I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.

**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.

Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the ""industry standard,"" Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).

Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.

Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)

**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.

I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.

The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*

**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time

I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.

I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.

**My positions:** 100 APHA @ $11.13,  2 TSLA @ $408.66,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $17.04,  100 SNDL @ $1.13,  100 22 RIGL @ $4.40

Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.

A trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.

More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.

""In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations,"" they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.

The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.

In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.

With the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The ""risk  reversal"" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.

If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.

The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.

Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.

The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.

During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

$UMC and other “less glamorous” semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months,107,lg5kmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5kmw/umc_and_other_less_glamorous_semiconductor/,41,1612912946.0,"With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can’t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer’s limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the “big fabs” that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can’t get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these “big-name” computing technology companies that you’re used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don’t mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn’t trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion’s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It’s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There’s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other “less sexy” fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.

So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand 🚀🚀🚀 , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.

**TL;DR:** PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week.

[https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750)

## The Play

If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.

***What are convertible notes?***

Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the creditor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***What's a call option?***

GTFO

***But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be ""in the money"".

***What's the ""strike price"" for PTON's convertible notes?***

This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above **$240/share**. 🚀 That's 65% upside from today.

***How big is the loan?***

PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M.

***Is there an expiration date?***

Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***What's the interest rate?***

Get this, it's **0% interest**.

Let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **The creditors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***What's the significance of PTON using call options?***

They state in their 8-K that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.

🚀🚀🚀🚀

**How to play this?**

Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.

Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.

If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.

## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF

This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🌝🌕 and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## Fundamentals

***Institutional ownership?***

70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this. 🚀🚀🚀

***Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.

PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People *want* to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.

It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.

PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.

Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***End of the pandemic?***

Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***Positions***

6/19 160c 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**tl:dr;** Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.

**Disclaimer**; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.

**EDIT:** Please don't downvote people who share bearish views in a polite and reasonable way. It doesn't help anyone to suppress opposing view points. Pic for the thumbnail:

Sony's most recent Game Developer acquisition is *insomniac games*  which includes spider man, Ratchet and Clank ❤️, Spyro ect ect.

&#x200B;

Sony's Aim is to get everyone on their ecosystem, and once that happens they win the game. In a year that price to earnings could decrease due to the increase in their earnings, at which point they will become severely undervalued.

&#x200B;

PS5s are being sold at a loss, because the game is in the ecosystem now. Once people are locked in, they start printing cash boys. What am I saying, they are already printing cash.

Here some notes for the real nerds:

Sony's biggest segment (in revenue) - Game and network services. which include PlayStation consoles and Software sales (games). Operating magin around 12%

Next biggest in terms of revenue is their financial services. Operating margin of around 13% and growing steadily for the past 6 years.

Semiconductors - Swings wildy, actually only 11% of total revenue but has done well on the back of the semiconductor shortage.

Music - Sony signs hugely popular artists, operating margin at a solid 17% average.

Pictures - Sony pictures is huge, and owns really popular brands, but only comprises of 8% of the companies operating income. Operating margin a rough 3%.

Oil got crushed March 2020 due to corolla virus and went negative for first time. I started putting money into Levered ETF's (GUSH, NRGU) around this time and have seen some pretty good returns but the best is yet to come.

Keystone Pipeline is gone which brought gas from Canada all the way through the US (the pipeline would be carbon neutral) which was putting the US on a path to gas/oil independence from the Middle East. This will push the demand of gas to the Middle East where there is basically no regulations on how the oil is treated - but hey were trying to save the earth!! This shift in demand from local gas/oil to the Middle East will drive oil prices back up. Strap in retards.

Daddy's DD of the week: $BB,2314,lg4gx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4gx4/daddys_dd_of_the_week_bb/,381,1612909786.0,"So i've been doing some research on certain companies and have been doing well on the one's i invest. This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, ""[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).""

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

Whether this is short or a long term play, I LIKE THE STOCK!

Wealthy investors C and D are politically aligned to B (Coal).

Investor C buys a long position in A, then loans out its shares to investor D with no intention to ever sell. 

Investor C reinvests the interest received from this lending into B.

Investor D sells the loaned shares to new investors E, F, and G.

Investor D uses the proceeds from the sale to pay off the loan interest then reinvests the remainder elsewhere or into Company B. Investor D is under no pressure to cover as they have a mutual agreement C will never sell.

Now in this simplified example, consumers EFG believe they are investing in their aligned interest, Wind, but in fact, the money is being immediately redistributed to Coal.

&#x200B;

**Major Highlights**

* 55% increased revenue YOY
* Over 100% increased revenue
* Full year of surpassing earnings expectations
* Outlook to increase revenue by another 5-10% throughout 2021

**Competitors**

* Primary competitor is LOGI.  CRSR outpaces LOGI in earnings growth.  CRSR operates at a market cap of 4B, compared to LOGI's 15B, despite having a revenue approx. half of LOGI's, pointing to CRSR being undervalued.

**Issues**

* Low float, leading to higher volatility.  Can be a benefit if looking at playing options spreads (keep that IV crush away from me)
* IPO Lockup.  Ends on March 22, so expect a potential decrease as early investors take profits.

Overall, CRSR has another quarter of showing a quickly growing company with a huge chunk of their market.  Bullish

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”

*****

> # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.

Yearly revenue up about 58%. But that's not even the main draw for me.


**THE BEST PART**

They are expecting nearly **$2 billion** in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $4.16 billion. They are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. Which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate. [AMD is trading at over 10 times their expected revenues in 2021...](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e44df3ff133f4000628a0be/960x0.jpg)

For such a small market cap stock, CRSR is an absolute steal 

And they are profitable quarterly and yearly! Planning to launch a bunch of new stuff this year. 

Potential acquire target which will sent them over 40% up overnight.

The stock will double in no time..buy! 🚀🚀🚀

Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it,1208,lg9ktu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg9ktu/some_dd_on_tlryapha_since_none_of_you_seem_to_get/,417,1612923415.0,"All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:* The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price.

The End of the Telcos,21,lg9dup,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg9dup/the_end_of_the_telcos/,100,1612922932.0,"Everyone take a look at the following stonks:  
Verizon, Centurylink, AT&T, Frontier Communications

None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.

All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.

These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural ""broadband"" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.

Verizon and AT&T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!

Now, Verizon and AT&T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.

The fact that both AT&T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.

If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.

**tl;dr** The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out.",2021-02-10 04:08:52

There's a little thing called opportunity cost. Selling at a loss sucks, but it can be the profitable move. If you hold a stock because it's at a loss until it hits X in Y months you will likely have less money than if you sell now, re-invest it and hit 30% on whatever you know is going up (weed, TESLA, renewables, online gambling, pretty much anything except treasuries right now).

How to go from a Virgin GME Ape into a Chad GME Investor on WSB,503,lg8qhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8qhg/how_to_go_from_a_virgin_gme_ape_into_a_chad_gme/,94,1612921305.0,"GME gang, we've got an image issue, and I've come to realize that while GME may be a good investment depending on what DD you choose to listen to, *you* are the biggest problem GME has.

Are there bots and shills here? Undoubtedly there were, maybe there even still is. At most I think 10% of the participants are/were bots or hired trolls. But what those guys do most is amplify the worst we have to offer on either side of this stock to set the tone. After that ball is in motion the shills and bots and trolls could walk away and we'd keep burning for weeks.

Consider this a social short squeeze. A bunch of newcomers here and give OGs short fuses. Then some outside actors come in and applies leverage to the friction between new and old users. Finally, OGs will squeeze GME holders into becoming social pariahs. And before you know it your own private portfolio has become a badge of shame. Regardless of everything else, *this* squeeze I'm describing *has* squoze.

So what can we do to get back into the good graces of our gracious, yet strained hosts? 

* Stop being a dork.  
* Stop clogging the sub with low-effort bullshit
* Stop flexing, 
* Stop acting like a junkie, e.g. ""YoU HoLdInG?""
* Stop using the wrong fucking flair, (for fucks sake it's not hard!)

And here's what you can start doing instead:

* Learn what other people are interested in
* Listen in on other DDs for other tickers
* Participate in discussions outside of GME, broaden your horizons
* Laugh at your own stupid mistakes
* Step outside of the GME threads and into others. Integrate with the community

Listen, hold your GME if that's what you want to do. Only you know your current situation and risk tolerances. I'm still holding, but I'm diversifying, and I'll be putting some of my gains from other investments into GME to lower my cost average. 

I don't think anyone here really wants you to sell GME. Instead, I think they want you to shut the fuck up about it. At least for now, while it's doing nothing of real interest.

Read and write your own GME DD based on numbers instead of vitriol. If and when GME flies again, be cool about it. Be quiet about it. And post the biggest fucking gains this sub has ever seen. 

Mods, I think we can get rid of the GME daily threads for a while. They currently only attract trolls and weak minded people who need constant reinforcement. I think it's time GME gang learns to stand on the merits of their own investments instead of huddling around each other like penguins in the long dark antarctic winters.

Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.     
    
If you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it’s currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.    
    
So how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?    
    
Well, all of DoorDash’s competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales. **DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.**    
    
Just six months ago [Postmates was acquired for $2.65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates) which put it at 4x sales. **At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.**    
    
DASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don’t give a motherloving frick about branding.    
    
### But don’t take my word for it on valuation, take smart money’s word    
    
[DoorDash raised money just a couple months ago at a $16 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/#:%7E:text=DoorDash%20has%20confirmed%20that%20it,money%20valuation%20of%20%2416%20billion). That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.     
    
You don’t have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. “It’s true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they’d have paid.” - Jim Cramer    
    
I don’t care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. 😘      
    
## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It’s over.     
    
There are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we’re going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don’t have to take my word for it that this company’s business has peaked. **The company says so itself in its own S-1.**   
      
>The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.    
    
To put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.    
    
 >”Delivery via smartphone is one of those venture-funded sectors where business executives appear to have taken seriously the old joke about “losing money on every transaction but making it up on volume.” – New York Magazine    
    
[“DoorDash and Grubhub and Uber Eats... it’s a tough business for them. It’s very competitive. I think the business model is hard.” - Panera Bread CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzQJdBHo3tw).    
    
## And Now the Fun Part     
    
There are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don’t know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren’t actually able to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the coming months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.     
    
I love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is “if you know a drop is coming, why doesn’t the market just price it in?” The answer is because it can’t. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn’t matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.     
    
DoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.     
    
The first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $127.50 right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn’t triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $190 to $127. It’s important to know March 9 is not a hard date exactly...some insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.    
    
I was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash’s daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you’re about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.     
    
Door Dash’s second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up “all remaining shares” according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.     
    
These two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.    
    
## Positions     
    
### FDs
        
I never buy FDs. I’ve never once bought them in my entire life. But I’m putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I’m confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its 🤡-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I’m sorry to say, that you’re not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you’re patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.     
    
### Puts
I own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I’m normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.    
    
I also own the August 20 $145 puts.     
    
And finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:    
Bought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and     
Sold the $172.50 calls.    
    
I went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $172.50 after the lockup expiration and I’ll be having a Merry Christmas. That’s as close to risk free gains as you’re ever going to see in your life.    
    
### Bull case    
The only bull case is that we’re in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.    
    
### What are the negatives?    
I plagiarized liberally [from an old Citron Research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf), although it doesn’t even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It’s only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.    
    
### Parting Words.   
I would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don’t care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.    

## Give Me One More TLDR At The End    
This stock is going to collapse because it’s wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.     
    
Love you guys.",2021-02-10 03:31:13

Just before it does come out I wanted to check that people understand what it is reporting.

The Settlement date of a stock is T+2, basically 3 business days.

So Just so everyone understands, that means the only thing you'll see is trading up to January 27th.

So up to that moment it had not actually hit the highest point, which occurred on the 28th, and for many firms they'd only receive their margin call after the close of the 27th, not during the day.  

So I'm just putting that out there, control your expectations and think ahead about what you expect to hear before it comes out 'cause i think emotional thinking will overwhelm some people at that point.

It is extremely likely you will still see a very high short interest, likely still over 100%, possibly even higher than 140%.So please be aware that this is BEFORE the price maxed, that a large percentage of those companies will have had to close their positions the very next day when the stock tripled in value, but that will not be reflected here.The specific hedge funds everyone is completely obsessed with also claimed to close their positions after Wednesday. This report is as of Tuesday, you will not be able to use it to confirm a conspiracy theory that they lied.

So do with the information what you will, I still expect some people to weave it into conspiracy theories, but at least know what the information in terms of the dates it covers.

EDIT: This applies obviously to the other stocks too. If you still really look forward to the report go read the old ones at FINRA so at least you understand what you're going to be getting

It's pretty safe to say there are some 10 figure bank accounts circling the drain right now looking at fails-to-deliver data and bargain prices with their mouths watering getting ready to checkmate the fuck out of their competition before they even know what happened.

Disclaimer: very high IVs on everything on the option chain. This was one of the memestonks from the GME era, which drew down very quickly. For those interested, short % of float is around 33% so this is not going to be a GME squeeze. 

Not going to talk about politics either because yes that is a major factor. You can go to plenty of other boards to see when Kamala will make the special agriculture ~~mandatory~~ legal. There are much better other stocks within this green ecosystem, but don't show this kind of massive inflow into the highest strikes (so lots of pent up demand, which in turn should drive the delta and gamma higher). 

So here it is. For the non-YOLO July 2021 and Jan 2022, the $4 strike (33% higher than the $3 which is a big jump) is getting around 5-6x of the volume today. Similarly on the OI, there's a lot of people buying. 

Yes, once higher strikes on chain are introduced, there might be a drop in interest in the $3 and $4. However, that's not to say there will be even more demand for the cheaper $5s and higher strikes, once again driving the gamma machine.

"Yesterday, if you followed my advice on TLRY you'd be up 100% in 24 hrs. Today, let’s talk about WKHS & OSK.

WKHS is at all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See: https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20
Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

> “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”

Oshkosh’s reply: 

> “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

The 5-2-3 Strategy: A New Way To Invest,506,lgdlw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgdlw1/the_523_strategy_a_new_way_to_invest/,122,1612933931.0,"For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.

&nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

I have 10 left which I'm holding. I got $2,092 out of the 14k I put in.

I don't know if I played the hand they manufactured or if I came to my senses, but I feel relieved. I crunched the numbers and invested in the cruise industry and realised my profits would make up for my loss. As I'm more certain that the cruising industry will rise again more than GME.

Now, if we're being honest with ourselves I put money into GME because I wanted to get rich quick. And then it turned into wanting to ""stick it to the man.""

Well, I read a post on here that swayed me the other way with logic I just couldn't ignore. It was something along the lines of ""if you know you're fighting a battle that's rigged, why not get out and invest in something that has more of a chance?""

That made the most sense to me out of all the other bullshit posts of people trying to get us to sell.

I may have lost 14k, but once the cruise industry gets back in gear and it goes to it's regular value (or higher) then I'll have made 69k in profit (he he). And while I'm not a millionaire, it's still more money than I realistically need and I can always reinvest part of that profit.

Point is, hold if you want, sell if you want. Do what makes you sleep better at night.

Honestly fuck the hedge funds they'll get their karma one of these days. And if it turns out GME goes up, I still have 10 @ 89.98.

Kicker is - I think ROKU is going to double again this year all day long... I am all in on this play until ROKU is done printing money... Going to 30 million, 50 million then 100 million even if it takes a few years.

The Importance of VWAP (part 2),197,lgbl0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgbl0i/the_importance_of_vwap_part_2/,64,1612928584.0,"Alright artards, listen up because I'm seeing bullish things.

Last week I wrote a post that looked at the GME chart and various important levels from a volume perspective (and the psychology behind that)....this is a follow up to that post.

Here is that original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume\_based\_ta/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume_based_ta/)

This second post will be short but I just want to highlight one thing. Take a look at this chart below (or your own) and notice how ever since that faithful day when 5m idiots got boned by Robinhood, price has not closed above VWAP (in this chart normal VWAP is orange and white line is anchored VWAP from the top)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/)

For those that don't know what VWAP is go google it, but in short, it's basically a volume weighted moving average that holds a lot of weight for traders and is an indication of where the balance of power lies within a market trend. As I mentioned, price has failed to close above VWAP since the major high two weeks ago. This is an interesting place for the chart right now because it is fighting with the pretty important $50 level. Why is $50 important? I think it's important because most of you idiots got into this trade above $50 meaning that we might have hit max pain on this trade as everyone is in the red. We will just have to wait and see...

**TLDR: If we hold $50 and finally manage to close above VWAP (today or tomorrow), then the odds tip in our favor for the party to start again. I'm not necessarily convinced that we are going to see this go over $500 but I think we will see a significant bounce and make a lower high relative to the last peak two weeks ago (say, $150/$200 range). Also, major bullish bonus points if we break above the red downtrend line and hold it as support.**

This is not financial advice. Make your own decisions based on your own assessment....i'm just trying to educate people on some TA concepts. I took a 40 share intraday position this morning at $47.80 and I plan to swing it through the night if we close above VWAP. If we fail to take VWAP I will be flat at the close.

&#x200B;

Update: Just made a convincing move above VWAP on big volume. Its about to retest back into it and if it holds thats good.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/)

Update: and it failed below. I got stopped out on 30 shares already and unless something miraculous happens into the close I will flatten on the final 10.

Final update on the day:

Ok folks, todays close was really interesting. Take a look at the chart below. About 1 hour before close we were above VWAP and then broke under with about 45 minutes left on the day. Then about 15 min before close we started to climb back up into VWAP but rejected. At that point I closed the rest of my position. LITERALLY at the final 30 seconds of the day we spiked above VWAP and closed above. To me this looked more like a weird liquidity quark rather than a convincing trend change but then the after hours action started and wow...this might get interesting tomorrow. Price just broke the downtrend (red line) and is currently testing as support. I put less weight on this price action as its happening after hours but if it holds that trend and holds VWAP in the first 15 minutes tomorrow then I think we see a big green morning.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/)

&#x200B;

Back again:

I just want to note that IMO this is the best risk/reward entry point for GME right now. GME closed above VWAP yesterday for the first time since the major peak (granted a bit of a weird close but still got it), then broke, tested, and resumed off of the downtrend support. Then, it fell through VWAP in the AM, held the low of yesterday, and then recovered in a big way. Now it's retesting back down at VWAP (as to be expected). Personally I'm adding here.

Tonight’s SI report,7313,lgb0h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgb0h7/tonights_si_report/,2530,1612927083.0,"Tonight’s report has been built up to be a make or break point for GME. I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let’s start with what we know about tonight’s report:

1) This report is based on self reported data. 

2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.

3) The data report covers up until the 29th.

So what are the possible outcomes:

1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.

3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven’t covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. 

Ok so I’m going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?

1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.

2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.

3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.

4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it’s a strange world we live in so I wouldn’t completely rule it out if they covered.

5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn’t already been done.

6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.

7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.

Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn’t bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. 🦍🙌💎🚀🌕

Edit: The report is supposed to reflect until the 29th.

 Payday 3 is going to be develeoped and released in 2023, is this too early to talk about it, is it apeshit to bet on a game for profits? 

Price is in krons so market cap is around 140million USD and it was around 50 million USD when raid happened. 

These guys saw they need new engine and they are going on Unreal Engine, i believe it is a great potential, they made the whole payday from stripped down racing engine. 

There has been heads changing in last years and last DLC's on payday2 were the most successful. Company is not profiting yet their share price rose with the success of DLC's, it was 0.5 kron at police raid, 1 kron after things settled down and now pushing high 1.5's. This is %300 with making positive annoucements and a damn DLC.   


What you think, does it make sense to bet on a game? Also for their genre i can only see GTA's heists close and GTA 6 does not seem to be releasing soon. Also for 2 year period, this is not an AAA game but a game that lives with addons, will it be short? Can it suck because it will be underdeveloped?

"Say it with me...R G B. If you are too busy crying about lost tendies and not looking at the $CRSR discount today, you don't deserve money",411,lga6ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lga6ua/say_it_with_mer_g_b_if_you_are_too_busy_crying/,178,1612924994.0,"So you could continue to moan and lick your wounds that you didn't become a millionare in 3 days, or you can sack up and make your money back on a surefire play.

Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish. 

This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked. 

**Why?**

Because its 2021 and every stock is doing the same thing post positive earnings. 

Check out [LOGI](https://imgur.com/D0FoKHV)....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast. 

CRSR is currently at the bottom of that curve right now.

Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows

Every $CRSR financial metric is extremely positive, huge gains over last year.

""But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you.""

No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.

**Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was oversold in direct reaction to GME**
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/holders?p=CRSR

So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for 7.5 million shares...price drops again. 

The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire ""runup"" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction to where it should be.

The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and *possibly* tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.

We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that.

Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME & AMC thing through.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Welp, I'm familiar with the furniture/mattress industry.  The demand for furniture and mattresses is through the roof right now.  You can verify this yourself if you want.  Go to your local furniture store and ask how long it will take to custom order a sofa (change the fabric/leather).  The likely answer will be 6-8 months.  This is obviously because of Covid.  


Prices for furniture and mattresses are rising on an almost weekly basis right now.  This is due to Covid shutdowns at the factories, the stimulus checks being right in the wheelhouse of furniture prices (hmmm, stuck at home and I just got $600-$1200 for ""free"" what should I buy? A new sofa!), and, believe it or not, a hurricane a few months ago that wiped out foam factories and caused a huge delay in manufacturing.


I'm long PRPL (I know it was a meme stock on WSB for a while, but look at it's gains over the last year).


Long LZB.  They're 7-8 months out for new orders right now (I know this because I still get their ""update"" emails for retailers for some reason).



And I'm long ~~TSI~~ (edit TSX, whoops).  Tempur-pedic and Sealy merged a few years ago, but they didn't fully integrate their operations until last month.  They actually shut down production of their mattresses in December until Jan 15 of this year so they could optimize their production.  Up until that point, they were essentially operating as two separate companies.  Not anymore.



I'm just sharing what I've witnessed over the last year, and investing in furniture/mattresses has worked out so far, and these issues in the industry don't seen to be going away any time soon.",2021-02-10 15:28:19

Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.

My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.

Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done. 

I am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now. 

I am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt. Good luck and Good fortune to all of you. Lets rock the world.

The real GME play is next month's earnings,121,lglvol,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglvol/the_real_gme_play_is_next_months_earnings/,157,1612960116.0,"Listen up apes; I know lots of you lost a lot of money over the past couple of weeks because you jumped on the hype train too late and bought the peak. I didn't. I invested in GME in December and took my 3000% profits on the 29th when it became clear that the momentum was over and that Wall Street would play all sorts of dirty tricks to prevent a true parabolic squeeze. I may not be half the autist that u/deepfuckingvalue is, but since I actually made money off this stock maybe you should listen to me instead of the bagholding conspiracy theorists who have been reaching the top of this sub lately.

GME won't be going to $1000, or even return to $420.69 anytime soon. That being said, GME is still an undervalued company with great growth potential. Lots of smart people have put out excellent DD on this company and I won't attempt to equal their work; if you want an overview and some valuation estimates just visit [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com) or watch Roaring Kitty's old streams.

Here's the deal: short interest is still pretty high and mainstream investors largely remain convinced of the BS ""next Blockbuster"" narrative. This belief, plus the WSB bagholders who are gradually cashing out is pushing the stock below the $60-$100 range I believe to be approximate fair market value. **GME is unlikely to rocket again until this belief is challenged, and the best opportunity for that to happen is the Q4 earnings announcement in late March**.

[In the sales report released early last month](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results), Gamestop reported strong sales figures for the incomplete 4th quarter of 2020 and indicated that it expects to report a profitable earnings report in March. **If GME reports a Q4 profit next month, it will directly refute the bear thesis of financial ruin and impending bankruptcy. This could cause another short/gamma squeeze around earnings, though likely smaller in scale than craziness a couple weeks ago.** The earnings announcement could also include new information about the company's innovation efforts, improvements in e-commerce and customer service, and creation of new revenue streams (PC building kiosks anyone?)

This is not financial advice and you should make investment decisions according to your own research, investment goals, and personal risk tolerance. I currently have 63 GME short puts at the $60 strike expiring on 2/19, and after assignment I plan to hold through earnings and maybe buy a few calls beforehand.

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,12041,lglrg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1345,1612959657.0,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

A cross trade is a practice where buy and sell orders for the same asset are offset without recording the trade on the exchange. It is an activity that is not permitted on most major exchanges.

Why is it important?

This is important for one particular stock that shan’t be named, because when you cross trade, it doesn’t affect the price of that particular stock.

Now what these traders are doing to beat the system is, they are buying stocks when the market is close, and sell those stocks when the market is open. Creating a massive negative pressure, when we plebs are looking at the price, but no effect when they are buying their stocks and we are asleep.

TLDR- Imagine a boat where you row forward every time you buy a stonk, and row backwards every time you sell.

I see people who don't get the concept of yolo and think this is some sort of investing forum or collective get rich quick scheme, and sadists who think it's a place to *""egg people on into doing a stupid bet then laughing at the results""*.  Maybe I'm wrong, but to me none of that has ever been WSB.

I'm not trying to gatekeep the culture, I wasn't here at the start although I have been around on and off for more than 5 years, and I think of WSB as a place where we make or become market memes, and occasionally share an intelligent high risk bet, or the large gains/losses from one. 

A place where there's more discussion than *""I like the stock""* - often using leverage or options in ways that will lose a novice money. A place where money is taken lightly and no one is gambling their house even if they are putting hundreds of thousands on the line.

I don't really care if people want to keep holding Gamestop in hopes of triggering a short squeeze to a million, if they can do it that's fine, but there's no finesse to pressing the buy button on a stock and honestly it's kind of boring compared to past plays. DFV's play was interesting and WSB worthy because he came up with a thesis, had conviction and posted the results, and along the way he didn't just buy stock he also flipped options to make like $13+ million in addition to the stock he was holding. Excellent content.

I'm curious to hear what other people who have been around here for more than 6 months think as well. Is there any way to keep the old culture, is it a lost cause with so much new blood, or maybe you even like the new evolution of WSB?

There's plenty of publicly available information that you should have read before YOLO-ing hard-earned money into a so-called 'movement'.

* Ryan Cohen bought shares at **$15** in mid-December.

* All reported insider transactions in 2021 have been sales of shares, ranging from **$19 - $36.**

* Kurt Wolf, a Director of GameStop **sold 810,000** shares of GME on January 12/13th at **$19 - $30.**

Now please explain to me how you, a reddit user with a moderate amount of karma, can justify a price for GameStop that is higher than $36 per share. What do you know that the insiders who work for the company do not know? Please enlighten everyone about “cloud gaming” or whatever. Maybe call Kurt Wolf and explain it to him.

He's a douche. I get it. People were too mean to him though. People made it way too personal. It's fucking scary seeing you guys turn into a mob. Remember when Reddit tried to find the Boston Bomber, they accused the wrong guy, and he [censored by automod]? That was super fucked up. I'm glad nothing like that happened with Andrew Left, but you guys probably scared the shit out of his friends and family.

Uber FD DD... 50/50,35,lgkw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgkw39/uber_fd_dd_5050/,47,1612956539.0,"So, I was just burned on Lyft and Uber puts because I didn’t do any DD and went in with just a ‘guess’ and ‘anecdotal’ evidence that they would have bad earnings and a larger loss than usual. So, I present to you my grappling at straws reversal. 


So Uber is the most well known ride sharing service with a market cap of $110 billion whilst still not being profitable despite many desperate  suggestions that they will turn a profit by the end of 2020. 
Uber has had a hard year as their revenue dipped 50% due to the virus and their losses tripled. They were hemorrhaging cash like always but more. And then they took the unprecedented step of selling their AI research division off. This has huge implications as from my understanding was their business model was to get a huge market share of the industry and then when autonomous vehicles are around it will enable robotaxis making them humongous profit.


This may seem bad but it’s very bullish. They sold it to start-up Aurora Technologies and will invest $400million giving it a 26% stake. This would be 10% of their revenue pre-covid and a much larger %age in these cash-strapped times. Though Uber has a very strong balance sheet dropping pre-covid from 10B to 6B in their most recent earnings - Q3 2020. This shows they are actually pushing to achieve profitability and may give a nice speech for earnings showing their bullish gameplan. 



UberEats was much less of a cash loss than Uber whilst still being a cash hole and during the pandemic this really shone through. Delivery rose 134% year on year. Also have you noticed their new ubereats fees such as the service fee? Bullish.



Ubers Q4 2020 earnings is after market close today and their EPS estimate is $-0.56. This is  huge expectation and I think it would be their most profitable earnings ever. Q1 2020 their EPS was -1.7 and Q4 2019 it was -0.63 - just pre-covid.
…
I’m not so bullish anymore but a FD is a FD. 



Lyft shares had an EPS of $-0.58 beating estimates of %-0.72 and they didn’t have the same opportunities such as fortifying their balance sheet by ‘selling’ their autonomous vehicle division or a profitable food delivery division.



Finally, I just want to make my money back and so this DD is just to justify myself and hope for the best. Pre-market prayer can start from now.

*""  Pursuant to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission request, FINRA   makes short sale trade data publicly available for off-exchange (OTC)   trades in exchange-listed securities reported to FINRA’s Alternative   Display Facility (ADF) .  FINRA makes two types of files available: (1)   Daily Short Sale Volume Files; and (2) Monthly Short Sale Transaction   Files (collectively, the Short Sale Files).

There are individual files for   the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq  Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.   There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale  Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed  securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.*""

I’ve noticed that barely anybody is talking about this stock even though they had multiple commercials during the superb-owl. 

ViacomCBS which owns - Nickelodeon, ⭐️BET, VH1, MTV, Comedy Central, C M T, and Paramount pictures

Is collabing with CBS which owns - Showtime, CBS access, and Sports ball (like NFL, NBA, College football championships, and the PGA Worldtour). 

To create their own streaming service. Disney + has already took all their content off of other streaming platforms and these services have the right to strip their content off Titans like Hulu and Netflix as well. 

Nickelodeon - has started their slime cam on NFL games to add their own cartoon touch to it. (yeah it’s corny, but it’s a nice twist) 

BET and C M T - have a select audience who would much rather pay for a streaming service then stay on cable tv to watch their programs.

VH1, MTV, Comedy Central - these channels are most of the older generations demographic and if they put old vintage content on there (MTV Cribs, Tosh.0, Beavis and butt-head) I see a lot of people wanting to relive those shows.

Paramount pictures - produced the Wolf of Wallstreet. I don’t even have to say anymore. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

CBS - is America’s most watched network for the 12th consecutive year. That means humans really like this TV guys.

I’m not saying this is a million dollar idea and im not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock and it’s potential is endless. Netflix is at $559 a share and I can easily see this one hitting $150 by the end of this year. 

Current status - $65 3/19 and looking to buy many more.

Aphria Inc (APHA): my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀,1455,lgj8fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgj8fp/aphria_inc_apha_my_final_post_before_merger/,747,1612950945.0,"Hello, some of you might know me from [my initial post before new year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn4wck/aphria_inc_apha_yes_its_cannabis_yes_its_about_to/) and [my follow-up post two weeks later](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwiuyl/aphria_inc_apha_blue_america_and_free_tendies/).  I suggest you guys read those first, because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts. I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger. I won't post again before merger, because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price. Next post will be about gains after merger.

# Introduction (another look back)

Well, well, well. I have to take you guys back to the beginning. After a long time lurking, the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit. What a journey that has been. I have to remind you guys that before [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) after they acquired Sweetwater, basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria. Then I made my post after the merger announcement, still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at (again a shout-out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA). When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow-up post, some people finally took notice (although still not a lot). And here we are right at this very moment, the entire subreddit is currently talking about it. 

I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read. But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD. I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk, getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life. That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now. Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich.

# There's no denying it: Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels

I told you guys before, once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks. This is exactly what happened. Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now. There might be minor political obstructions, but there's no stopping the general movement. Once the American legalization movement is done, it will probably also influence European regulators. Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point. If it isn't already, let me give you another couple of reasons why.

**It's not about the joints, it's about the CBD oil.** Let's be honest: to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it. You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image? CBD motherfucking oil, I would even say it has a very positive image. Most people probably think about it like this: joints = junkees in the park getting high, CBD oil = people suffering from cancer relieving their pain. Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted, that doesn't change the general consensus about the product.  
You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects, CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people. People will be buying drinks, food, even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it. The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products, because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana (EU mostly). Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025.

**Markets are fucking insane right now, cannabis mania 2.0 is inevitable.** I don't have to tell you guys about it. This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again, except this time there is actually nothing holding it back. The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018. There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment, so I quote old pal George Soros: ""The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more"". The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people. Green energy, EV, cannabis: all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them. Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around, can you guys believe it? The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment. Praise the lord, Amen.

# Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage: TLRYtards are missing out

**There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria. There, I said it.** I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post, but here is a small summary. Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray. Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive 0.8381 shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0.8381. The only risks are (1) the merger doesn't go through or (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced. 

Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0.67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0.57 at this moment. I've seen other people post about this, but they are missing something. As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced, the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0.8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date. The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA, the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore. All you have to do is compare YOUR buy-in price with the Tilray price. As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0.8381, you will profit from the merger. It's as simple as that.

**TLDR:** Cannabis = arguably best growth market for the near future or long term. Aphria = best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger. APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement = free tendies, no reason to pick Tilray. This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price.

**Positions:** I still have my measily 30 shares @ $8.74 that I've been holding since the start of December. If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in, I will probably buy more.",2021-02-10 11:55:45

Anyone that's been here a while knows this kind of trash talk especially isn't normal or okay, it's not what we're about.

A large hedge fund vs. Reddit army story was shot out into the public. Mysteriously, buying ability was cut before the projected timing of the squeeze on social media. Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they're smarter than us & kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN'T shorting GME aren't trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y'all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can't remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you'd be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you're a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you're probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over. 

This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.  

🚀🚀🚀

tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren't active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they've probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I'm not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.

EDIT: I've been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren't selling in true WSB degenerate fashion. Anyways, I think I'm going to get off this sub and hold until this all blows over...",2021-02-10 11:49:24

2nd rule of wallstreetbets is that wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit  


I've been subbed and unsubbed from this subreddit about a thousand times. I've lurked for years. I've posted. I've commented. The number of times that I've seen the term bagholder in the past 6 years I could count on one hand. The number of times I've seen the term bagholder in the past week would rival my loss porn in zimbabwean dollars.  


Wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit. Bagholding is what happens when you make a good investment, get greedy and miss the window of opportunity to cash in your investment. I can't be a bagholder because I wasn't ever investing.  


I'm a gambler. This subreddit is for high risk high reward gambles particularly ones that occur with stocks, options, and trades. If I buy a stock and hold on to it as it falls to the ground, then plunges through the ground, then winds up in Satan's basement it's not because I was bag holding. It's because I made an epic gamble and the gamble lost.  


This subreddit for the longest time has never had gains as it's highest priority. The honor has always been reserved for the highest %change. It's always been about taking risks. And it loves to see a high %loss just as much as a high %gain.  


DFV isn't a hero because he put 13 million dollars into his pocket. He's a fucking hero because he dumped 50,000 into a deep OTM call. For months he lost money. Crazy amounts of money in fact. And you know what, he held. And this subreddit loved to see his losses. He's a hero because he held onto the ball long after most people would have sold.  


But if the 4 million new people on this sub had logged in May of 2020, they'd all be talking about DFV as a ""bagholder"".  


If you use the term bagholder, you don't understand this sub. Go elsewhere. Go to r/investing. Buy an index fund. Collect some dividends and set them up for reinvestment. But don't come here and pretend that you know shit about shit. You don't even know the fucking language, let alone the culture.",2021-02-10 11:30:30

I encourage you to go look at both S3 Partners and Ihor's twitter and see for yourself that they have always been consistent in the format that they report their data.

But I know you are retarded, so you won't, so I will share them for you.

Ihor's explanation
https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356019385706688512

The above tweets caused a shit storm around S3. People claiming that they were fudging numbers, got a call from Citadel, and that they changed the way they report SI to be sneaky. Here's some additional tweets by both S3 and Ihor (who works at S3) that objectively show that they have always been consistent with how they report short interest. 

Jan 29th S3 reporting float with both SI and S3 SI

Jan 5th Ihor reporting float with both SI and S3I
https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1346561814956552193

They have always reported SI % AND SI S3 %. They have always stated that the former is the traditional and the latter is their method which prevents the percentage from being over 100%. These above tweets are just limited to GME. You can browse their tweets over a variety of other stocks and see the same method of reporting. This data is consistent with other sources, it's not like S3 is out there peddling numbers that no one else agrees with.

To consider as a bear thesis.

&#x200B;

1. Every 5-7 years there is a significant correction. Save a quickly recovered Covid crash we're on year 12. 87-91, 91-98, 98-2003, 2003-2008, 2008-Now?
2. Last time PE ratios were this high (2008) they crashed back down. Previous was the dot com bust.
3. Today's Volume was stupidly low, which is concerning.
4. It wouldn't be a stretch to say we're in a mania phase of a bubble.  Look at all the new 'dumb' money pouring in.
5. The economy doesn't ""feel"" healthy, the divide between rich and poor is getting worse, real unemployment is high, no definitive end in sight for the covid-pocolypse.

&#x200B;

Then all the contrary stuff.

1. We're on QE (some fucking high number). The Fed is going Brrr, has been going brrr, and doesn't look like they are gonna stop going brrrr.
2. Along with going Brrr they are keep rates super low, which means there isn't a place to put money other than stonks.
3. Yellen has been fed chair during booms, and doesn't wanna fuck up her rep. She's more concerned with unemployment than inflations, which means she's gonna keep going brrr, and she's Keynseyan AF.
4. Biden et al probably don't want to be seen as responsible for a market crash, and I don't know how much longer they have to let it crash where they can say it's from Trumps policies.
5. Maybe the March covid-crash was enough for the steam to be let off, even though it was temporary AF.

Grantham is generally bearish, and he's saying he expects early summer correction. [https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)

I'm looking for something concise from Mohammed El-Erian

Michael Burry seems bearish, but last I saw was still long a lot of domestic equities.

Anyone else?

So I guess I'm thinking inflation is gonna be a bitch, the fed will keep going brrr, and the market will get increasingly uncomfortable because it seems like it's on borrowed time, but will continue going up until it doesnt.

[Finra - GME](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) \-- **Short Interest**: 78.46  
[Finra - AMC](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G) \-- **Short Interest**: 15.70 (some people have reported that it's not updating for them and they still see 38.12)

[WSJ - GME](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME) \-- **Short interest** **% of Float:** 41.95  
[WSJ - AMC](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC) \-- **Short interest** **% of Float:** 66.06






**Edit 1:** As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don’t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float

**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.

**Edit 5:** I’ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC. I’m holding both. The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know. To the moon 🚀🌒",2021-02-10 10:09:56
"Disney ($DIS) Earnings (iChing, Horoscope, Tarot)",163,lgh9kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgh9kw/disney_dis_earnings_iching_horoscope_tarot/,68,1612944521.0,"**$DIS**

Current price (6:32 pm, February 9, 2021): $188.80

IPO price (09:30 am, November 12, 1957): $13.88 ($128.66 in 2021 dollars)

For my first query regarding Disney's stock price, I consulted the iChing - an ancient Chinese divination method that involves flipping 3 coins 6 times in order to form a hexagon based on their results (i.e. heads or tails).

The upper trigram of this query was Gen, while the lower trigram was Kun, giving us the result of 23. According to [divination.com](https://divination.com), this means [""Splitting Apart.](https://divination.com/iching/lookup/23-2/)""

Key takeaways: 

I don't believe we need to take ""Splitting apart"" literally, as in indicating a stock split. The bottom line of the iChing reading indicates the need for patience and bravery, which to me is a bearish signal. We may have to wait longer for parks to open, or earnings may not be as good as expected.

If we are to believe positively in the executive leadership of the Disney Corporation, then the second line indicates a willingness to change. I take this as a signal that they are pivoting to focus on direct to consumer revenue streams such as Disney+.

The third line clearly indicates the announcement of a partnership - or perhaps the ending of one. We will see on Friday.

The fourth line references to the misfortunes Disney has faced in the pandemic, but gives us hope that these times are coming to an end.

The fifth could indicate many different things. I feel that it could either be a positive signal relating to the pandemic coming to a swifter than expected end (positive vaccine news?) or it could indicate a growing dissatisfaction with political and other forces hampering Disney's business model.

The sixth line is absolutely bullish. I expect very positive forward guidance based on the iChing reading.

**Horoscope for Friday, February 11, 2021**

**DISNEY SUN: SCORPIO**

**DISNEY MOON: CANCER**

Data source : [Cafe Astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/scorpio-daily-horoscope-day-after-tomorrow.html)

Key takeaways:

""Today's New Moon occurs when Venus aligns with Jupiter in your solar fourth house, dear Scorpio. It's a beautiful time for feeling warmth or a **feeling of abundance**.""

""It's a time for emphasizing cooperation, trust, and faith.""

""It can also be an excellent time to clear space around the home. Whether you're going bigger or creating the illusion of more space, it feels good. ""

""There can be nice progress on a long-term project.""

""You might enjoy fond memories or activities that focus on comfort and familiarity.""

""You're inclined to make meaningful changes that enhance your current \[...\] arrangements.""

""Avoid acting on impulse, and instead, focus on learning about your true needs.""

To the WSBer reading this, it may seem bullish. But if you happen to be a member of Disney's board, I advise you to look at that last line and make sure that the decisions you are making as a company are good for the company as a whole. Avoid short-sightedness and rushing into things.

Predictions based on the horoscope: Bullish. Partnership. Scaling down parts of the business that are no longer profitable. New project announcement. Something tantalizing about the parks and cruises reopening.

**Tarot**

I only drew one card, the [Upright Magician](https://randomtarotcard.com/TheMagician.jpg).

[Keywords](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-magician-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings): willpower, desire, being resourceful,, skill, ability, concentration, manifestation

This is an incredibly bullish card for $DIS. 

""There can be increased financial opportunities available right now, you’ll likely just need to pursue them with gusto. The magician works with many tools to make his will manifest.""

**Random Number \[1,300\]** (courtesy of [Random.org](https://Random.org))

**292**

According to [this website](https://www.sunsigns.org/angel-number-292-meaning/), this number symbolizes getting insight and understanding in order to solve pressing problems. Note that is also in the 97th percentile of possible numbers. I interpret this as bullish on Disney's stock price and forward guidance.

**Conclusion**

Disney is going to blow out earnings and the stock price is going to skyrocket.

After 2 hours on hold with Fidelity today, they told me Robinhood had rejected the transfer. The reason they gave was that I had margin on my account. The problem is, I had already followed a redditor's advice and had downgraded my account to a cash account days before. I had made sure everything had settled before I initiated the transfer. 

Now, in Robinhood's app, I no longer can find the option to disable instant deposit/margin. It seems they've hidden/buried it further. This is absolutely unacceptable.

Ryan Cohen is at the helm of this dying company. YES its a dying company that's why its a high risk high reward play. Could cohen fail? Yes he could and the company could go bankrupt. Do I think it will happen? Not at all especially with this free marketing.

People were doing amazing DD before your screaming drowned them out. Calling gamestop and finding out some stores are shifting into Gamestops 1.5 focused on building pc's and build a pc kiosks.

If you want to make your money back keep it in GME and talk about the upsides and bring actual conversation to the table. Make your voices heard to gamestop management you want them to involve pc building. I think bundling game pass and a built pc at gamestop is a great way to take share away from steam give it to Microsoft and build some capital for gamestop to utilize.

Give feedback on the app, what is easy and hard to use. Join the powerup Pro rewards program. BUY STUFF FROM GAMESTOP. 

Gamestop has a chance to actually be a 20-40B company if they get a stranglehold on pc parts. they have the ability to beat CyberpowerPC and IbuyPower because they can afford lower margins for prebuilt pc's with their already set up distribution centers. They can open stores in all the areas microcenter doesn't exist. Microcenter does 2.5B in revenue with only 25 stores countrywide. that's insane!

Desktop PC market is 8 Billion yearly revenue. Bro that's a lot of market share they can chip away at. 

Seriously stop looking at SI and making up shit to cope and actually help the company turn around to save your investment.

I believe everyone here, from what I've seen, is just looking at the number on the report and say OMG LOOK AT THAT SHORT INTEREST!
  
  
The notice from Finra, however, says that is not an accurate way to read the data.  Bolding of key points below is mine.  
  
FINRA believes that the following three key points about the short sale volume data may help market participants better understand and draw informed conclusions about the data. As discussed below, the data: **(1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not—and is not intended to—equate to short interest position information.**  
  
  
Keys to Understanding Short Sale Volume Data  
First, as noted above, the data in the Short Sale Files includes only trades that are publicly disseminated and excludes trades that are not publicly disseminated. **As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.**  
  
A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.  
  
Second, as noted above, the data is published separately by FINRA for each FINRA trade reporting facility and by each exchange, and is not consolidated. **Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.**6  
  
For example, suppose that for security ABCD, FINRA published a combined short sale volume of 3,000 shares and total volume of 15,000 shares for all of its trade reporting facilities.7 Viewing only this off-exchange data published by FINRA, the percentage of short sale volume to total volume would appear to be 20%. Suppose, however, that there was also activity for ABCD executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that day totaling 125,000 shares, of which 12,000 shares were reported as short. This volume is published by NYSE on its website, separate from the volume published by FINRA. When considered together, the overall percentage of short sale volume to total volume for ABCD that day is 10.7%, which is much lower than the data published on the FINRA website would suggest.  
  
FINRA notes that the SEC has a webpage where market participants can find links to the short sale volume data published by FINRA and the exchanges,8 which may facilitate consolidation of the data and provide market participants a more complete picture. However, some exchanges charge a fee for access to their data.9  
  

Finally, **short sale volume data does not—and is not intended to—equate to reported bi-monthly short interest information.** FINRA rules require firms to report, on a per security basis, the total quantity of shares held as short positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts twice a month. FINRA publishes the short interest data for OTC equity securities on its website, while the data for listed stocks is published by the exchange on which the stock is listed. **Although some websites redistribute the Daily File and refer to the data as “short interest,” it is not, in fact, the equivalent of reported short interest information.**  
  
**Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related (i.e., short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.**  
  
For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD.",2021-02-10 09:28:03

One thing I see is an endless amount of people talking about their losses on 10 shares of AMC or 2 shares of GME. **I'm down a little over 7k on AMC and GME alone right now AND I KNOW THIS IS ROOKIE SHIT.**

GME squeeze has been squoze? I believe so... for now.,0,lgfy5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgfy5g/gme_squeeze_has_been_squoze_i_believe_so_for_now/,219,1612940571.0,"I am of the opinion that many of the HFs have covered their short positions. This was more or less confirmed by the NYSE short interest report published today.

As seen [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/iZE8xhq) short interest dropped from 132% to 46% from Jan-15 to Jan-29. (EDIT: short percent of freefloat dropped from 132% to 46%)

I pulled out of GME to stop the bleeding (I know, paper hands). I entered at 321.

Since I have made some money back on GME puts. The short interest report published today is a bearish indicator if you were planning on holding out for short squeeze. I'm sorry to say that a short squeeze is less likely than before. It's unlikely that we will reach the same highs as before unless shorts double down again. We will have to keep an eye on the short interest for the foreseeable future.

For now, bearish sentiment around GME is indicated by the [2.78 put/call ratio](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).

Today I placed an order after hours for a GME $50 put expiring on 2/19. Not financial advice.

Here are some good and interesting stocks to add to your research list. Not everything has to be A GME AMC bagholder debacle. Where are they now?

Anyways, There are many good plays to watch out for: OPEN,  offers to property sellers through an online process, improves and repairs the properties it purchases, and relists them for sale. Markets are changing folks. People want instant demand. OPEN had a nice runup today but within the next 6 months will be wayyyy better. This is a strong hoousing market play that will shake up the industry. Like uber to taxis. Q4 earning on 4-March-2021. Don't sleep on these guys. Holding long with stocks on this one.

&#x200B;

PLTR. Ive been mentioning this one time and time again. I firmly believe in this company. They have a strong leadership team. They are pulling in big contracts and their financials are looking promising. They havent mooned just yet and I am personally invested in this company. However, I am only mentioning this stock for the potential it has. It is a massive analytic software company that can do amazing things. Their software program combines massive data queries into a seamless almost gamelike visual representation easy for the user to comprehend. Yes they had a nice runup recently do to an IBM partnership. I am holding long with stock since it was $18 and i have LEAPS for Jan 2022.

&#x200B;

A more risky stock with the potential for a large runup is CLOV. If you dont know who Chamath is, he is a legend now and someone i highly respect in the financial world given his background, knowledge, and calling out those hedge funds during the GME debacle. CLOV is a healthcare provider play. Now why is this a risky play? Well with Biden as president of the USA, he plans to decrease medicare eligible age from 65 to 60, I know thats huge. Currently, each week, there are 10,000 new people eligible for medicare. those are some massive numbers, numbering billions added in revenue for the industry. Chamath is on of the major reason behind this stock. He is a person focused on growth. He assisted Facebook back in the early 2000s and look where they are now. His backing of CLOV will put them in the spotlight especially if there are positive changes to medicare (especially since offfering medicare plans is their specialty). Chamath walks the walk and talks the talk. But as always do your own research. I personally invested stock in this company. and i look forward to see where this goes.

&#x200B;

Look at the big picture everyone! Stay positive and ask lots of questions.

&#x200B;

So now what should you do with this information??

TLDR: OPEN, PLTR, CLOV good stocks. DO YOUR OWN DD

Rolls Royce isn't doing so well. They're losing billions. Their stock is in the dirt, and it looks like people have started picking it up, for dirt cheap.

Some day, the pandemic will fizzle out and air travel will pick up. That will cause the demand for jet engines to pick up, and if RR is still alive by then, their stock should start a recovery.  
If one was to invest in Rolls Royce, this might be the time to yolo in and **hope they don't go bankrupt**. And then wait out the pandemic and hope for their recovery. So basicly, it's a really stupid investment. Unless if it works out, then it's not stupid. If RR survives, they might come out the other end with their fat trimmed, ""lean and mean"".

Obviously not financial advice. This is merely an observation. If anything, it might just be interesting to watch how low their stock can go.",2021-02-10 08:19:46

A thread on pfizer,41,lgtdtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgtdtj/a_thread_on_pfizer/,102,1612991680.0," 

The consensus here and in the market is that all the money to be made on Pfizer has been made. I disagree for a few reasons and am currently pumping money into this stock as much as I can. Before reading this, I want to state as clearly as possible I am not in any way a professional/financial advisor I am a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student the only proper education in this area is from yale open-source courses and from books like stocks for the long runs. I believe Pfizer will bottom out at a worst-case scenario of 32$ if I see 32$ I will yolo my portfolio into 3-month 40$ calls, but what I am hoping for is it does not recover until the next quarterly report in which case I will yolo my portfolio into five day or single day calls. Again, I cannot stress enough I am not a professional please do you own research before following me and also if u see a flaw in my theory please tell me. I also want to state that Pfizer has a market cap of 200 billion we do not have the buying power to in any way pump that I am not trying to generate hype around this, but it is 50% of my portfolio.

1 investing fundamentals. 

One of the most important ratios in investing is the price to earnings ratio. This fundamentally indicates if a stock is over or undervalued. In the book stocks for the long run which is high on yales economics reading list the author states that a p/e ratio of 16 or higher is overvalued currently the market average is 27 indicating a stock market crash is coming however Pfizer’s is currently twelve. As a dividend stock which it historically has been it would be undervalued based on pure economic theory. To give some examples of competitors p/e ratio Johnson Johnson=26 AstraZeneca= 26 moderna is not profitable. My point here is that Pfizer has one of the best prices to earnings ratio of any company on the market right now indicating it is undervalued. This also indicates in the event of a market crash Pfizer will be one of the best stocks to be holding.

2 currently in a large dip that Pfizer always recover well from

The Pfizer share price has tanked in the last few weeks as wall street decided that spending 2-3 billion developing  the COVID-19 vaccine to save the world was too much money to spend (typical fucking scum of wall street). As a historically consistent  dividend paying stock Pfizer is a well-liked stock by hedge funds and pensions these funds do not reward bad quarters and pulled out this has caused the price to dip over 10%. In the last few years this happened before in July Pfizer announced that it was planning on changing its business model all these funds pulled out and the share price dropped 8 dollars, from this and the fact that it is fundamentally undervalued I believe it wont drop more than 8 dollars. 

3 the vaccine revenue will actually take Pfizer to the moon. 

For all these hedge funds focusing on dividend stocks quarterly profit is all they care about Pfizer spent large and didn’t earn extra last quarter Pfizer is expecting at least 15 billion dollars in profit from the vaccine alone, when you add this to their typical earnings that is 65 billion expected earnings a 30% increase on their usual earnings , they will absolutely smash their last quarter performance, all the investing into the vaccine has been done now it is time for them to cash in. on top of this Pfizer has massively cut expenditure by splitting the company into two Pfizer and viatrus (I will address this at the end)

4 AstraZeneca vaccine might not work.

It does not work on the Brazilian or south African strain. 

5 professional opinions 

Every market pundit I can find is estimating that the share price hits 42 dollars this year, some estimating up to 69(nice) while I don’t always trust sources such as CNN money or market commentators in general what It is to me is a validation of my estimations and research. 

6 change in direction to become a growth company.

Last year Pfizer announced they were changing their business model from a revenue to growth company meaning they offloaded essentially all non-patented drugs which provided consistent but low revenue this allows them to focus on developing new highly profitable drugs such as the COVID-19\_\_\_0 vaccine while these have high start-up costs of 2-3 billion Pfizer is worth 200 billion and can easily ride out the volatility of 1/5 investments not working when for example the Pfizer vaccine will net them 15 billion minimum (could be more if AstraZeneca fail) that is not all the investment will makes the miRNA technology means they can make a new vaccine in 2 months if needed, this technology will be ridiculously profitable. Typically, investors buy into companies with a growth business plan at wildly overvalued prices e.g., tesla p/e is 1700 because the prospect of future growth outweighs the lack of current earnings Pfizer is a company aiming for huge growth who are also one of the most fundamentally undervalued stonks on the market. 

Conclusion 

Pfizer share price is wildly undervalued the market will not take long to correct this when it bounces back it might rocket to the moon and I am strapped in for that moment but even if it doesn’t it will get a 15% gain; I believe that the dip is turning now . my plan is to do this. 

A hold the shares I have buy 3 month calls with 40% of my remaining portfolio.

B if I see 34 dollars put 10% of my remaining portfolio 3-month calls. 

C if I see 33 dollars put 30% of my remaining portfolio in 3-month calls. 

D if I then see 32 dollars yolo my life’s savings (10 times my portfolio) In 3-month calls. 

E if the share price is still below 40 dollars coming up to the next quarterly report, I will yolo in 5-day calls aiming for a 2 dollar gain per share (Pfizer has a huge market cap it will move slowly)

This is my opinion on Pfizer I am not in any way qualified to give financial advice  for honesty I am saying I have a position I Pfizer, but I do not believe it is conceivably possible for us to adjust the share price of a 200b dollar company . Please if I have missed something let me know before I yolo on this am I just retard",2021-02-10 23:14:40

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‘bigger than any one account,’ CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday’s premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is “bigger than any one account,” said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump’s second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he’s no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

*****

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/)

Cresco Labs ($CRLBF) - Why I like this weed stock,264,lgs5q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgs5q7/cresco_labs_crlbf_why_i_like_this_weed_stock/,156,1612987161.0,"TL:DR at the bottom. Not financial advice.

With weed stocks gaining momentum, I thought I share one which I believe is undervalued vs other key players. Cresco currently operates in 9 US states.

This analysis will focus on what I believe are the three most important factors for cannabis - Revenue, Revenue Growth, Liquidity.

***Revenue - Cresco vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 355M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.5B
- Canopy Growth: 477M Revenue ; Market Cap 18.3B
- Curaleaf: 472M Revenue ; Market Cap 11.6B
- Cronos: 37M Revenue ; Market Cap 4.8B
- Tilray*: 201M Revenue ; Market Cap 6.7B
- Aurora: 273M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.1B
- Aphria+Tilray: 803M Revenue ; Market Cap 20B

If we look purely at revenue, only Aurora and Aphria/Tilray merger appears to have a similar market pricing to Cresco, with a Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 11 and 13 respectively vs Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 10 for Cresco. The 4 other stocks vary from a ratio of 24 to 133.

This means purely on revenue, Cresco could be considered to be undervalued vs other key weed stocks.

***Revenue Growth TTM vs 2019 - Vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 175% Growth
- Canopy Growth: 111% Growth
- Curaleaf: 114% Growth
- Cronos: 54% Growth
- Tilray*: 20% Growth
- Aurora: 10% Growth
- Aphria+Tilray: 99% Growth

Cresco has by far the highest revenue growth ratio. And this is just looking at ttm vs 2019 as Cresco have their 2020 fiscal calendar report in April. This means on top of these figures, some of these companies would have had more time to grow revenue vs their fiscal calendar 2019 due to differing fiscal calendars.

***Liquidity***

Below I'm only looking at current ratio and quick ratio. The higher the ratio, the better.

- Cresco Labs: 1.06 / 0.53
- Canopy Growth: 6.09 / 5.16
- Curaleaf: 1.42 / 0.64
- Cronos: 4.73 / 4.62
- Tilray*: 2.82 / 1.86
- Aurora: 1.54 / 0.97
- Aphria+Tilray: 4.44 / 3.09

Cresco has a lower market cap as it is a possibility it does go bankrupt this year if things turn for the worse. However Cresco has a positive EBITDA in their last earnings report and if it does get an injection of cash/stronger results than expected, there is massive room to grow to reach the same value as other companies in the same category.

One of the things that is holding it back is that you can only trade the stock on OTC markets or the Canadian exchange. If it does enter a major US exchange, I can see it go big.

Just like every other weed stock, this stock has growth plans with new dispensaries in yada yada, will have better productivity due to yada yada, increases cultivation by xxx% in yada yada due to yada yada space, and has a new Chief Commercial Officer who has great experience in CG in companies such as yada, yada yada, and yabbadabbadoo. Do your own research, all weed stocks have something new and exciting like this one.

Trades as $CRLBF or CAD$CL.CN. I have 120 shares.

TL:DR: Dude weed lmao

I do sympathize with it, it must be annoying seeing a complete sea change in a sub you enjoyed.  I personally lurked, and kind of ingratiated myself. I don’t post to the sub really, just comments.

The best way to solve this would be for someone to set up a new sub, something like “GMEBETS” whatever and then the influx of only GME posters can migrate there. This allows apes their own enclosure, takes pressure off the mods and allows for discussion of other stocks/plays to flow more freely on here.

Compass Pathways [$CMPS] - Trusting Peter Thiel With My Psychedelics Bet,278,lgr4yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgr4yj/compass_pathways_cmps_trusting_peter_thiel_with/,139,1612982739.0,"Hello fellow degenerate gamblers,

Kimchi here... back with another DD to make you all some tendies. My last posted DD was all about headphones... ended up being a nice 5-bagger *with stocks*. I'm here today to tell you about Compass Pathways \[$CMPS\], a company I think will be my next multi-bagger trade.

***Psychedelics:***

Why psychedelics? Psychedelic (and $CMPS in particular) companies tend to focus on the medical aspect of shroom use, looking to create medications to **treat illnesses that are traditionally underserviced**. Compass, for example, focuses on treatment resistant depression - essentially depression that hasn't been able to be treated by medication, counseling, etc. Depression rates have been rising for years and CMPS and other psychedelic drug makers look to **target those most affected**.

[Depression rates increasing](https://preview.redd.it/bygysv8wcmg61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=3392bcff460f4e60e1d30201a20b4977fac5fc9a)

Psychedelics have also been anecdotally shown to help with [PTSD](https://maps.org/research/articles/6230-the-veteran-psychedelics-for-ptsd-what-a-long-strange-trip-it-s-been) and [opioid addiction](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/09/10/ibogaine-psychedelic-opioid-misuse-therapy). It's a field that's just now starting to gain traction and hopefully those who need help the most will be able to get it as the science develops.

***Why Compass?:***

So why $CMPS out of the many stonks in the psychedelics universe?

*1) Compass Pathways is the only psychedelics company currently listed in the US.* 

I don't mess with OTC stonks (have been burned too many times) and I don't mess with Canadian listings (who calls their currency the ""Loonie?). Don't know why other companies haven't listed in the US yet, but I'm not messing with those companies until they do.

*2) Peter Thiel is the largest shareholder and they have a superstar board/advisors.*

Everyone here knows and loves Peter Thiel; he owns 7.5% of the company. The board members at CMPS include the former R&D head at **Merck**, the former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals at **Johnson & Johnson**, former Executive Director of the **European Medicines Agency** among others. Their scientific advisory board includes doctors from **Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Imperial College**, etc. This is a company stacked with talent.

*3) CMPS has received FDA ""*[*breakthrough designation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-startup-edges-toward-fda-approval)*"" and are currently on phase 2 trials.*

Breakthrough designations are typically given when preliminary clinical trials show **significant improvements over existing treatments**. ""Breakthrough therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible.""

*4) CMPS runs the COMPASS Discovery Center, which is working on finding uses for psychedelics.*

The biggest pushback against $CMPS is that they're currently only working on one product, COMP360, for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. However they also run the COMPASS Discovery Center, a collaboration between Compass Pathways and various universities to find new uses for psychedelics. **$CMPS will be the exclusive licensee for all new compounds generated.**

*5) They're just seem like good people.*

Sure this may not be important to company profits in the long term, but this is something that makes me feel a bit warm and fuzzy inside. They recently [raised](https://www.standard.co.uk/homeless-fund/compass-pathways-support-the-homeless-fund-london-b919073.html) over 1.4mil GBP (Around $2mil 'merica dollars) to **help the homeless in London**. Maybe I'm stupid, but this helps me trust the company's leaders a bit more.

**Target Price:**

I'm not a research analyst so I'm not going to break down the numbers in terms of sales of COMP360 or potential profits from licenses from potential discoveries at COMPASS Discovery Center. Smarter people than I can do that analysis...

However, just looking at how high some of the weed stocks got in 2018, I don't think a market cap of $20bn is a stretch (that would put **$CMPS at around $500 to $600 a share**) if the theme takes off. GW Pharmaceuticals, a cannabis company that specialized in creating medication from cannabis, recently got acquired for $7.2bn. I put my trust in this star-studded company to do some incredible things.

**Positions:**

5,500 shares (I don't do options) of $CMPS.

**tl;dr:** Psychedelics has the potential to help those with depression, PTSD, addiction, etc. Trust in Peter Thiel and $CMPS to take us to tendieland.",2021-02-10 20:45:39

I’m well balanced and even now average out at $131.37 including taking enough profit last week to be in the green overall(ahead of what remains invested) and taking into account I invested $4.5k on behalf of my brother which negatively impacts my position. 

I’m up.

I’m comfortable.

I can remain in play indefinitely with zero impact. 

Having said all that, the perfect time to buy across my whole journey is right now. Squeeze ain’t been squoze. Price is reasonable AF. Future is bright. Marketing is free, and as a side bonus there’s half a chance of breaking a hedge fund. 

The future publicity through movies, docos and financial text books is infinite and I can’t see any way that you lose money in the short, medium or long term. The Social network... enough said.

VFF - The perfect storm in weedstocks,222,lgqyww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgqyww/vff_the_perfect_storm_in_weedstocks/,122,1612981975.0,"Gonna keep this brief bc apes hate to read. 🍅🚀

VFF has the LOWEST float of any major LP at 65m shares. Deduct the approx 10m shares the ceo owns and you're looking at 55m shares float (add another couple of mil from the insiders/directors and it's even less). Less shares means high volatility means large potential energy means 🔥🔥🔥 in a bull market!

They are profitable right now. No other public LP can claim that now or in all of 2021. Heck CGC just said they won't become fcf positive til 2024. In the immortal words of Chris Tucker, ""do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?"" Profit = good!

So while they can run with their silly tiny float, they are actually a great company to invest in because they actually make money, have low debt, and have over 100m in the bank. 

Low float + profitable rn + weedstocks = 🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🍅🍅🍅

Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest,573,lgpn8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpn8y/nyse_v_offexchangefinra_short_volumes_for_gme/,118,1612975888.0,"**The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded ""upstairs"" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...**
* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**
* **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
* **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.**

&#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Comparing NYSE to OFF-EXCHANGE short volume with respect to GME's Float.](https://preview.redd.it/4qhtpaqqflg61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ca1196548a84f92c5c8d87b1c83b2f863cf812)

* Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Short Volume\/Total Volume from FINRA and NYSE Daily Short Volume files, respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0zdmv7czlg61.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=df17986998464f35f8053bb0c3c3daa92285cdf2)

* Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.
* Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+

&#x200B;

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

&#x200B;

|FINRA|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|84,529,878|155,033,361|79,236,275|
|Short Exempt Volume|1,119,003|**3,437,532**|**4,306,437**|
|Total Volume|193,791,490|415,527,741|146,617,603.00|
|Short Vol/Float|1.80|3.31|1.69|

# NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!

&#x200B;

|NYSE|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|13,279,699|49,046,558|19,041,023|
|Short Exempt Volume|587,776|**5,075,452**|**7,304,781**|
|Total Volume|31,822,868|105,950,709|43,875,824|
|Short Vol/Float|0.28|1.05|0.41|

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

# NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker...

# Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?

# RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!

*""For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes.""*\-  [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:**

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2. **""Short Exempts""are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**
4. **Still waiting on FINRA for the**  [**FINRA Monthly Short Sale File**](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021)

Not advice of any kind, I should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit, and I miss chewy runts!

Edit:  u/SolveThisProblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for SI: In the post I used short/(outstanding shares (yahoo finance) to calculate the 226% to 78% SI change, however Morningstar/FINRA  use shorts/ float which is (Outstanding Shares - Insider Holdings - Untrading lnst.

NVAX - 3 to 4x potential - Market ignoring recurring revenue,44,lgpjiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpjiw/nvax_3_to_4x_potential_market_ignoring_recurring/,48,1612975417.0,"As NVAX was late to party, analysts estimated its initial revenue lower.

But given the [mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants) and booster vaccine development in full steam, I think covid 19 revenue are very likely to extend beyond this year. [UK authorities are already laying out plans](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) for annual vaccination. In such scenario, NVAX is actually better placed than Moderna.

So Q2 2020 onwards, I dont see NVAX revenue to be lower than Moderna. Market is already beginning to realize that. I expect its market cap to come inline **🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I believe most people are likely to go for Novavax when it comes to next jab because:

1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)
2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)
4. They plan to make a [Combo vaccine with their Nanoflu](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax/novavax-to-explore-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-post-pandemic-idUKL4N2H42Z7?edition-redirect=uk) \- so instead of annual flu vaccine, people can simply go for combo
5. And obviously [highest efficacy (95.6% original, 86% UK, 60% SA strain)](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3).

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.

On Jan 29th, Principal investigator of their UK trial had expected [full analyses target of 100 cases to be reached in 2 weeks](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/944923#vp_2). It seems we should be pretty close to next price action now.

Some people involved with this (which is honestly a big part of why I'm about to Forest Gump my ass through Vietnam, across the fucking country, and back home to lose my virginity to a chick with AIDs just to get this thing):

* Shaq
* Kevin Mayer, Former TikTok CEO
* Lebron ""hold my dick"" James
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
* Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO & COO

The announcement ***just*** came out. [Full version](http://on.wsj.com/3aP3Gzc) for those of you with actual attention spans.

For those that don't. Here are the **highlights**:

""Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion.""

As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.

Beachbody is expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year.

""Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies""

Other awesome things about this team:

* Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody [owns the majority stake in their shared company Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#Divisions))
* The company [also owns P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#History)

**My Basic DD:**

The company is well diversified between 3 separate entities. Each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.

Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but it's not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.

The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance that the biz actual works

Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and ***HEAVY*** digital marketing spend.

**YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.**

Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn't you think they'd fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven't you learned from 2008?

Face it! We're apes. And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?

I'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me. I can't afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I'm basically fucked and don't know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?

**I STILL HOLD.**

This isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.

**This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.**

For ONE fucking time in your life - just do **NOTHING** and **HOLD**.

WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we'd have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what. War isn't held by rules.

Southwest ($LUV) For Reopening (long term play) - and how to do your own DD,146,lgkscb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgkscb/southwest_luv_for_reopening_long_term_play_and/,56,1612956186.0,"Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night wondering which airline stock you should go long for the post-pandemic reopening? Well autist, if this is you, then you should stick around for this DD. I'll be comparing the four hottest airlines and make a case for why I $LUV Southwest. This can also serve as a walkthrough if you still don't know how to do your own DD. So grab a beer, strap on your helmet, and review the alphabet one more time, because hopefully by the end of this you'll learn how to do your own DD.

# Financials

Ok, let's start by examining some financial metrics. Now, we don't want to just look at a snapshot of these companies' financials at the end of 2020; we also want to see what these metrics looked like before some guy decided to chow on some bat soup. This will help to give us an idea of how they changed and what to look forward to as we approach reopening.

For the 7 million of  you new here (holy fuck), or for those of you with aggressively smooth brains, I'll go over some of the more complicated metrics.

* **P/E ratio** (price-to-earnings ratio) - share price divided by EPS. This can help us determine the relative value of a company's share price compared to its competitors.
* **P/S ratio** (price-to-sales ratio) - market capitalization divided by revenue. This shows how much investors think each share is worth compared to the company's revenue.
* **Profit Margin** \- profit divided by revenue. This tells us what percent of revenue actually turns into profit.

These are simple calculations, and you can find all the data necessary on yahoo finance \[1\]. If you don't know what profit, revenue, EPS, or market cap are, then at this point just buy 0DTE SPY puts and hope for the best. Below is a table of these metrics for UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV for the year 2019.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$88|$22.1B|$43.3B|$12.5B|7333|0.51|28.9%|
|AAL|$27|$12.4B|$45.7B|$10.4B|7105|0.27|22.8%|
|DAL|$58|$37.6B|$47.0B|$10.4B|7945|0.80|22.1%|
|LUV|$54|$28.0B|$22.0B|$6.0B|12558|1.27|27.3%|

&#x200B;

LUV's P/E and P/S ratios from 2019 may suggest that it was overvalued compared to the other airlines. But this won't matter to you once we see how much better they are doing compared to the rest of the field in 2020. Below is a table of the same metrics for these airlines for the year 2020.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$43|$22.1B|$15.4B|\-5.0B|\-1.70|1.44|\-32.5%|
|AAL|$16|$9.8B|$17.3B|\-7.6B|\-0.87|0.57|\-43.9%|
|DAL|$40|$25.6B|$17.1B|\-6.5B|\-2.05|1.50|\-38.0%|
|LUV|$47|$26.3B|$9.0B|\-1.9B|\-8.64|2.92|\-21.1%|

&#x200B;

Again, the P/E and P/S ratios could suggest that LUV is overvalued compared to the rest of the field, but a valuation above its competitors is warranted because of how much better its profit and profit margins are. But these metrics are just a part of the picture; we also want to analyze a company's balance sheet to see how it fairs in terms of its total assets and liabilities.

# Balance Sheet

A company's balance sheet can easily be located on their annual 10-K or quarterly 10-Q SEC filings \[2\]. The data for this analysis will be extracted from each company's 10-Q form for Q3 (since not all of them have filed a 10-K for 2020). The two sections on the balance sheet we want to pay close attention to are the assets and liabilities.

In the current assets section, we'll be looking at AR (accounts receivable) and most importantly CASH, because CASH is KING. It's important for a company to have lots of cash on hand because it shows how able they are to pay off short term debts. There are other sources of assets listed in the file, but I'll skip those since they aren't as important as cash and AR.

In the current liabilities section, we'll be looking at AP (accounts payable) and maturing debt (debt that is owed pretty soon). All you need to know about AR and AP is that they are basically opposites. AR is money that a third party owes the company pretty damn soon, and AP is money that the company owes a third party pretty damn soon. A good rule of thumb is that these values should generally match up. Here as well, there are other sources of liabilities listed in the file, but I'm skipping them because they aren't as important as debt and AP.

Lastly, we'll also take a look at long-term debts and debt-to-equity ratio, to determine how much debt a company has to pay off in the future and how much debt they are leveraging to finance their assets.

Still with me? Ok good, more numbers now. Shown below is a table of the current assets of UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Assets|Cash|Accounts Receivable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$16.5B|$13.2B|$1.2B|
|AAL|$21.4B|$0.2B|$1.1B|
|DAL|$25.0B|$16.5B|$1.5B|
|LUV|$16.1B|$12.1B|$0.9B|

There are two things you should note about this table. First, around 75% of LUV's total assets is cold hard cash. We like to see that. This also compares closely with UAL's cash. But another thing to note is how dogshit AAL's small pp pile of cash is. They're in some shit and will probably have to leverage more debt to make short-term payments. But regardless of that, so far so good for LUV. But let's see how everyone is doing with their liabilities. Shown below is a table of the current liabilities of these airlines.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Liabilities|Current maturities of long-term debt|Accounts Payable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$15.8B|$4.6B|$1.8B|
|AAL|$16.3B|$2.7B|$1.0B|
|DAL|$19.7B|$5.0B|$2.4B|
|LUV|$7.8B|$0.7B|$1.0B|

Hopefully by now you're starting to see how much doper LUV is compared to its competitors. LUV has more than double the current assets to liabilities, less than $1 billion in short-term debt (which is easily covered by their amount of cash), and generally equal AR and AP. No other company listed here checks all three boxes.

Finally, we'll examine long-term debt and debt-to-equity ratio shown in the table below.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Long-term Debt|Debt-to-Equity Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$22.3B|7.74|
|AAL|$26.5B|\-12.36|
|DAL|$29.8B|22.6|
|LUV|$10.1B|2.64|

Immediately glaring off that table is the fact that DAL is levered to the tits and AAL has a negative debt-to-equity ratio. So in essence, DAL is dogshit, and AAL is dogshit wrapped in catshit. But our shining star LUV has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 2.64 which, when considering how the pandemic has impacted air travel, is pretty fucking stellar. And compared to the rest of the field, LUV is sitting pretty with only $10 billion in long-term debt.

# Business Operations

Now that we've seen the numbers, it's time to dig a little deeper to see how Southwest's business operations will lead it through the reopening. Most of the following information can be found in Southwest's 10-K filing (I'll link any alternative sources). Southwest began operations in 6 new airports in 2020 and plans to begin operations in 8 more airports in 2021, including Chicago O'Hare (hint: that's a big one).

The Boeing 737 MAX also has a role to play in all of this. These aircraft are more fuel efficient than their predecessors (hint: this saves costs), and Southwest is quick to add them to their fleet. I know you're probably thinking the MAX is dangerous and a liability to the company, but I promise you the MAX is probably the safest plane in the sky right now because Boeing knows they'd be in deep shit if they fucked it up again. Southwest will start flying MAXs again in March, and they currently lease or own 41 of these aircraft, which is about 5% of their fleet. This year they will be adding 107 more MAX 7s and MAX 8s, which will then make up 17% of their fleet.

But what really sets Southwest apart from these other large airlines is that the vast majority of their business is domestic, so during a reopening economy, they will see operations return to normal much faster than their competitors that also rely on revenue from international flights.

Finally, Southwest continues to offer low fares in part due to their use of higher complexity flight plan optimization models. They use linear flight systems instead of the simpler and more common hub and spoke methods that other airlines utilize \[3\]. If all that flew over your head, don't worry, all you need to know is that this helps Southwest save costs.

# Institution Holdings

For any DD, it's also important to see if institutions own a certain stock. It's always good to have the big boys on your side in an investment. Let's see how institutional ownership compares across the airlines we've been studying.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Institutional Ownership|
|:-|:-|
|UAL|57.2%|
|AAL|43.8%|
|DAL|60.9%|
|LUV|76.0%|

As you can see, the big boys favor LUV over the rest \[4\].

# Technicals

Fuck outta here with your crayons. This is a DD for a long-term play so miss me with those head and shoulders, cup and handle, batman, or dick n balls lookin ass patterns.

# Final Notes on Macroeconomic Trends

After being locked down for a year, there's going to be some serious pent up demand for vacations and travel. Southwest is in a perfect position to meet these demands with its low fares, and will emerge from the pandemic mostly unscathed relative to its competitors. Also, two bags fly free? Say no more fam. With that being said, I think Southwest is on pace to eclipse its ATH and I see its share price worth no less than $80 EOY (maybe more considering the retard strength of this market).

However, this thesis and price target is completely invalid if the market turns bearish, no matter how successful the reopening is for airlines. But, as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the heights of this market, then calls on everything.

&#x200B;

Positions: LUV 1/20/23 70C

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, congratulations. If you didn't, fuck you, read the TL;DR I guess. Did I leave anything important out? Do you disagree with my thesis because of some critical information that I didn't pick up on? Let me know. Also if you enjoyed this and want to see another DD, I'll take some suggestions.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

* LUV profited way better than its competitors during the pandemic
* LUV has a great balance sheet compared to its competitors
* LUV is adding more destinations and using more MAX aircraft ($$$$$)
* Institutions love LUV
* Pent up demand for travel this year means $$$$$$

Do Market Makers need to report naked short sales ?,35,lgngko,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgngko/do_market_makers_need_to_report_naked_short_sales/,19,1612966224.0,"Apparently Market Makers can perform naked short sales if it's in the course of bona fide market making or whatever

I was curious if they need to report to FINRA but I haven't found anything that clarifies that one way or another, however I did find this one letter that is on the [SEC.GOV](https://SEC.GOV) portal using google lol, this is from 2003 though!  So maybe the rules have been updated since? Anyways here's the letter

Why BB's Contract with Motional is Bigger than We Realise.,338,lgl1ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgl1ub/why_bbs_contract_with_motional_is_bigger_than_we/,73,1612957100.0,"There are already numerous posts about the news that can out today but I wanted to put this out there because I saw a common theme among the comments that a lot of people don't know how big Motional is.


https://www.techrepublic.com/article/blackberrys-qnx-to-power-motionals-driverless-vehicle-platform/


I had the same reaction until I looked them up. Motional is not some fly-by-night start-up.


1. They are a $4 Billion joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv where Hyundai put in $1.4 Billion dollars and has the backing of the South Korean government which expects them to have fleet rollout by 2024.


That means we know there's some serious intent with this company and they have the money to pay for BB's products.


https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362322/hyundai-aptiv-motional-autonomous-vehicle-joint-venture


2. Motional isn't just a concept, it has a product out on the roads right now. As of Feb last year, they already had 100k paying customers via Lyft. That's right, they already had a soft roll out. They are targetting a full self driving robotaxi service with lift in 2023.


https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/


3. On the same note, they are launching robotaxis with Via in the first half of this year. This year!


https://motional.com/press_article/motional-and-via-partner-to-launch-a-platform-for-public-on-demand-shared-robotaxi-rides/


4. Along with Amazon WS IVY partnership expecting to make bank in 2023. It seems like BB is poised for an explosion in revenues starting in 2023. Most tech companies out there are priced well into the future yet BB seems to be priced for this or next year at most. If the market can wake up to this then BB could do really well. 

This is on top of Baidu, and all the existing clients of QNX.


Those are just my own thoughts so I welcome further discussion.

$f Ford is a huge money making opportunity right now! Easy 3x in a few months when Mach-e starts hitting the streets🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,233,lgmx2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgmx2u/f_ford_is_a_huge_money_making_opportunity_right/,241,1612964092.0,"🚀🚀🚀🚀
Basics. Market cap is smallish roughly 40bIl. Means even if they double they are still tiny compared to Tesla! Even if the 10x they are half the size of Tesla. This means room to grow 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy brands and consumer loyalty. Has factors in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.🚀🚀🚀🚀

New CEO! Who reshaping and got the business back on track! Auto sales are up significantly and they closed under performing regions.

Time to talk about UNG,0,lgmxdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgmxdj/time_to_talk_about_ung/,29,1612964124.0,"Mods blocked my first post for some reason so here it is again

Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use [natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/images/whf_longformat_0132018.pdf) to heat their home and the other half uses electricity, but guess [what the majority of electricity generated in the US is with natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20was%20the%20largest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25) at 38%. Most people are ignoring it because of the green stock push, but the only green is dollar bills :D Starting tomorrow and in the upcoming weeks its going to get extremely [cold](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/index.php).

Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until [2022](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46476). This means that production is not replenishing storage as fast as other years. Right now there is a small surplus in working storage if weather holds (hence the long term trade) that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.

The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask [Japanese utilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/asian-spot-lng-price-hits-record-on-cold-winter-supply-crunch) what happens when storage starts to run low!!!

**Why buy now** its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.

$UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.

There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .

Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC

For those of you that want to follow the [natural gas storage numbers](https://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) (updated every Thursday at 10:30 ET)

**TLDR:** If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.
