Now SEC is investigating, brokers are disallowing buying more calls. This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a “well shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?”

We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didn’t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.

It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that can’t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I don’t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one.",2021-01-28 21:30:35

My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come.

 I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

$GME price has nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with financial economics,382,l6u96y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6u96y/gme_price_has_nothing_to_do_with_fundamentals_and/,61,1611861358.0,"Firstly, all of you diamond hands and smooth-brains are hereby promoted to Brigadier General today. Paper hands should be ashamed to succumbing to the pressure from dementor hedge funds.

I would also like to preface this post with the fact that this is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequiality, poverty, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.

Billionaires are not baddies, at least not all of them. It's what they decide to do with their wealth that is the problem. Using one's wealth perpetuate inequality and injustice is not cool. If all hedge funds were dismantled tomorrow, there will be absolutely no negative consequences to society or social fabric. Hedge funds are not the greatest capital allocators. In fact they are shit at it and the last couple of weeks have proven it.

Sending lots of love to the following billionaires / millionaires: Elon, Chamath, Ryan Cohen, even Warren Buffet and Dr Michael Burry

Fuck you's: Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital), Steve Cohen (Point72), Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi (Maplelane Capital), Ken Griffin (Citadel)

\------------------------------------------------

Now to the main part. What you fellow degenerates, smooth-brains and soft-heads have discovered is called a 'market inefficiency' and are correcting it. The market is acting exactly like it's intended to act. **You are not the problem, you are actually the solution.**

***Why fundamentals don't matter?***

Fundamentals stopped mattering the moment $GME's short interest breached 100% of the available float. See, markets should work as a two way function (you should be able to derive x from y and y from x). There is no possibility at all to buy more than 100% of the available float at any point in time, so why would it be possible to short more than 100% of the float? Why would the market allow such an asymmetric property? Well it shouldn't and the market would and is correcting that.

***So what does matter?***

What really matters now is first principles. Yes, exactly like Papa Elon resumes most of his thought processes as far away from foolish abstractions (read 'fundamentals') down to first principles, this is exactly the same thing what the market is doing right now.

The fools at CNBC (fuck you Wapner - hope you are reading this), CNN, Boomerberg have described the price as being irrational, devoid of logic and reason. So let's break this down for them starting from first principles, Economics 101.

Supply and demand form the most crucial concepts of economics. Whether you are an academic, farmer, banker, hedge fund loser, smooth-brain redditor or a CNBC reporter, the basic premise of supply and demand equilibrium is integrated into your daily actions. Only after understanding the basics of this can the more complicated aspects be mastered.

So let's look at the demand and supply of $GME shares

Demand side:

* Bullish investors - it is no secret that a lot of the investors have taken a position after the narrative around $GME's business model and future prospects are significantly more optimistic with Ryan Cohen now in the driving seat. Now that brankruptcy is out of the question, it is for each investor to decide what the fair value for the stock is. I will leave this part to each one of you individually, as I am just a degenerate smooth-brain redditor that doesn't know shit.
* MMs (no, not market manipulators, just market makers) - these guys sold a ton of short-dated call options to you and haven't learned a shit from what happened last Friday. They are going exactly the same path this friday. There are now around 300k of OI that are ITM (probably more by end of today), which translates into 30M shares that need to be found to the option holders by EOD tomorrow.
* SS (no not the nazi troops, jsut the short sellers) - yeah, you know exactly what's going on here, since this is the essence of the story. Short sellers borrowed around 70M shares and must get them at any price.

Supply side:

* Float - these are the shares that are openly traded and exchange hands every day. Around 51M shares (probably less since you all have diamond hands)
* Share issuance - the company can decide to issue new shares. I believe $GME shelf issuance ammount is around $100M. At yesterday's share price of $347, that's only 0.3M shares. But let's round up to 1M

So what do we get:

Demand = 30M from MMs + 70M from SSs + 10M from bullish investors (this number is out of thin air, I have no clue what it should be). **Total demand: 110M**

Supply = 51M from float + 1M from share issuance. **Total supply: 52M**

Demand / Supply ratio: 2.1x

I will let CNBC, Boomerberg, CNN find another security, commodity, bond or whatever that has that demand / supply ratio and then make judgement on the price for $GME shares.

Finally, *the invisible hand* is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, characterizes the unseen forces that move the free market economy. It is that very invisible hand that came back to slap the shit out of the 'masters of the universe' hedge funds that decided to ignore the most basic principles of economics.

If any of the hedge fund dementors read this, note that the free market will always, always humble you and put you back where you belong. Fuck you!

Their reasoning was that I didn't have enough cash to exercise the calls and they don't know if trading of GME will be halted for some time in the next few days. Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I ""also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now""

I told him that there are apparently enough hedge funds with no risk management either, and that we wouldn't be in this situation otherwise. But he didn't seem like he wanted to hear that.",2021-01-28 20:18:32

In 2008 I was in the middle of my first enlistment.  My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.

I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.

I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.

And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.  And always remember the motto of the Marine Corps, ""Semper fidelis""--Always Faithful.",2021-01-28 20:16:28

&#x200B;

As you're all aware, Point72(along with citadel) injected \~2.7B into Melvin.  The reason why I bring this up is because Point72's owner, Steven Cohen formerly ran SAC capital. Point72 is a family office, SAC was a hf. Cohen and friends got into shit for insider trading along with paying off research firms to get access to information before anyone else to be the first to profit. They engaged in frequent insider trading which they referred to as black edge and emailed trade ideas with a scale of conviction to show their confidence in the trade. By emailing their trade ideas with a conviction rating and not specifying their source protected Cohen from getting in trouble.  

At the end of all of this, some traders pleaded guilty but Martoma(who served jail time) was Cohen's super bitch because he didn't want Cohen to get caught. Cohen closed SAC and made point72 which happens to be performing outstanding well. He paid a $1.8B penalty. Digging a bit [deeper](https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/content/viewform/adv102012/Sections/iapd_AdvDrpSection.aspx?ORG_PK=161111&FLNG_PK=02571B2200080189034C92F10037612D056C8CC0), you can see that Cohen has been using material non-public information since 1999. That report shows what they have been caught doing. Imagine all the shit that they got away with.

“In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have  put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC,  and other securities,” a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch,  referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. “We made these  decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market  conditions and other factors.”

It is unclear to me at this point what ""some transactions"" means. Large transactions? Derivates on the stock? Buy orders in general?

If what is written in this article is true, the ""technical difficulties"" that some brokerages were stating yesterday evening are questionable. Maybe someone should read the terms of agreement of TD their TD Ameritrade account and comment if they are allowed to do this. Maybe some SEC rule aplies instead, I am not familiar with this yet.

A Question for today when markets are open:

\- Who is experiencing trading restrictions?

And for the whole community?

\- Are there alternatives?

So shorting well more of stock float, maybe even naked if done so, is ok for institutions, but buying a lot of stock in a collective is not ok. All of this while brokers usually make a lot of money from retail investors trading risky options / derivates, which also result in individuals losing it all.

TL;DR - If robinhood didn't change the rules to spread out the sales of all your ITM contracts you fuckers can't afford to exercise, they would have sold them all at 3;00pm Friday. The market makers would be the only buyers, they sell the shares they were holding to hedge the contracts they sold, they sell all of them at once, large push down then paper hands then stop losses and flash crash.

**BONUS MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF POST.**

\------- now to the real shit.

First off, not a bear or bull, I have GME and will add later yadda yadda. I'm just pointing out an observation.

Second off, this is just a theory. No fucking way I know if this is true. It's gonna sound scary, sure, but I want some genius fucker hedge manager who is pro-GME to tell me how horribly wrong I am.

Robinhood changed the rules and you can't buy any 1DTE or 0DTE positions on GME for 1/29. Ya'll got the memo. That sucks because we ALL know you guys were going to hold on to your positions for EVERY LAST OUNCE OF ROCKET FUEL. (I don't do emojis, sorry.) Robinhood may have just saved you by not letting you.

Most of you fuckers who have options have 100c, 150c, 200c whatever. You know you need money to exercise that - at a cost of $20,000 to exercise for one contract is a little more than most can handle, especially the newbies here.

Under normal circumstances, robinhood would sell your position on Friday back to market at about 3:00pm give or take 5 minutes. The problem is that I've seen the order sheets... It's you lot that owns most of the 1/29 call positions (tiny order sizes... 1 to 5 contracts.) That means most of you won't be able to exercise your position and that means it has to go to market ALL AT ONCE. (Again, this is under normal circumstances.)

What happens when you sell a bunch of contracts at bid to the market? The bid goes down, quite possibly below intrinsic value, the market makers buy it, especially in the last hour of the day, and they do the opposite of what they did last week.

They sell shares against the lower delta. If they are the ones that buy their own contracts back especially if below intrinsic, they sell however many shares the delta was for that contract. They don't want to hold on to those shares if they don't have to. That's not their game.

But they're not just selling for the 350c that's ITM while the underlying is $360. They're selling for the 220c they got at the same time. The 200c they also got. They don't need those covered anymore. So they sell on those as well. The more they sell, the more contracts start becoming OTM and the more they can sell against the lower delta those just became.

If you flush the market with contracts where there is essentially only one buyer - MMs - this kind of thing can happen and you can end up with a potential gamma flush. Opposite of a squeeze. Queue in paper hands and stop losses and you have a very nasty flash crash.

In essence, if Robinhood does NOT do the 3:00pm flush of contracts and instead actually spreads the sales out over the next 2 days, then they saved what could have been a potential flash crash wiping everyone out.

Good luck out there, be safe, make some fucking money, and imagine there are some damn rocket emoji everywhere.

https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/DDS/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/Dillard

Dillard's $DDS share float is only 4.24 million or 19.26%. What this means is every dollar thrown at Dillard's will affect its price 5x more then a stock with a 100% outstanding float.

The lower the float the easier it is to moon.

Look at this mornings price action. DDS ran 20% to $128 on 240k of volume before being halted and shorted back down. If this stock gets any attention it will run faster than my dad from his parental duties.

Look at the after hours activity. It ran from $82-$93 on 400 shares. That's the type of moon possibility we are dealing with. Any volume premarket can send this up 50%+.

The Total Short Value Could be Underreported - Fines for Underreporting are a fucking joke,750,l6s675,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6s675/the_total_short_value_could_be_underreported/,88,1611852884.0,"During my research on short interest and stats on short history (for my previous TA I did on GME and posted) I came across a release from FINRA. 

In 2015 FINRA fined Morgan Stanley $2M for under reporting their short interest. 

Let’s say that again - fined $2m 

If a fund is a few billion dollars deep in a short - their underreporting of short interest is way more fucking beneficial than paying $2m

This system is fucking rigged and needs to be taken down. 

The regulators are basically saying, “You can destroy companies and fuck over retail all you want. But you gotta pay $2M first.”

We must fight against censorship. WSB is showing how censorship can effect us all if we don't reject it.,629,l6s2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6s2vf/we_must_fight_against_censorship_wsb_is_showing/,97,1611852510.0,"There is a desperate and coordinated effort to thwart everything retail investors are doing, censor and ban their communication platforms, and lobby for regulations to protect the elite Wall Street investors against the retail investors.  

CNBC has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to 'protect' the retail investors from themselves.  As short-selling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars, CNBC has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected.  

These ultra-wealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine, and they are transparently using it to their advantage.  Not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors, they are also using their power to CENSOR these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech.  

Tech companies, likely influenced by their politician buddies in Washington, have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support.  Youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances.  Twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users.  Facebook has been doing the same.  And most recently, the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy Twitters largest potential competitor: Parler.  It was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to Parler.  They all used the same justification, even though their own platforms were equally as guilty, if not moreso, of the same wrongdoings.  It was blatantly coordinated censorship.  And they don't care, because they have the power.  

Droves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities, and they can censor anyone they want.  Many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the First Amendment.  And they are legally correct (barring any future antitrust legislation), but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship.  

Free speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution, it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded.  Censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100's of years.  But recently, it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored.  

And then we have WSB and GME.  

The people of WSB rarely if ever talk politics.  We are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies.  People from every background come together and discuss one thing: investing and tendies.  There is no left or right, no red or blue.....only green.  

But now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts, the wallet, the elite are using their power to censor.  

First, we have Discord.  Over 250,000 people on the WSB discord.  [And it was censored for 'hate speech'.](https://gizmodo.com/discord-bans-r-wallstreetbets-for-hate-speech-violation-1846146314)  The most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence: call them hateful, racist, etc.  

Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. 

Who do you think pulled the strings on Discord for them to censor the WSB channel?  

And now you have Reddit.  Commentators on CNBC have already called for the WSB subreddit to be banned.  And with Reddit's investor profile, who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit.  

So you see, this isn't just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs.  This is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power.  Many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said, 'yes, I'm okay with it because I don't like their politics'.  But many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them.  We must collectively reject and fight back against censorship, lest it comes to effect us all.  

I truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship.  We need to get back to 'we the people' controlling this country and not 'we the elite'.  I know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some, but when it comes to our culture and values, that slope can be slippery my friend.

I SUGGEST A FULL TRADING HOURS POST BLACKOUT TOMORROW (Except for mods if necessary) OR MAYBE BETTER AN AUTO-DELETION OF ANY POSTS MENTIONING THE NAME GAMESTOP OR TICKER GME. And during this time, we all need to know only one thing, which is to BUY GME, and don’t worry about the establishment playing dirty. We are only playing their own game while they try every dirty trick. As long as we keep our diamond hands, none of these scare tactics can or will work.** 

I’m a SPACs guy. I’ve been sitting on the sidelines for this because honestly at first I couldn’t care less. WSB isn’t my thing.

Then I started reading the news. **The hate. The vitriol.** Targeted at who?! Not the guys who shorted 140% of a stock’s float?? But at retail?? Seriously? Every news station I see, every YouTube video from the TV is in protection of the establishment, Melvin, and Wall Street. 

Then I started reading the stories from the small guys. YouTube comments. The Reddit posts. Families **devastated** in 2008. Surviving off beans and rice and out of work. And the hedge funds? They were bailed off and eventually made off with their billions. 

These same folks are ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HISTORY THIS TIME. And these folks know what it’s like to be hurt. **AKA they have COMPASSION**. The number of posts I’ve seen sharing their newfound wealth with someone who needs it … Unfathomable for what I originally had thought of wsb. It’s something Wall Street will never understand. Not a penny of profit goes to charity. Not a penny of profit goes to helping others.

**AND NOW THIS?! NOBODY is on our side except our own damn selves.** 

The brokerages are on the other side. TD Ameritrade restricted GME trading. So called 'Robinhood' sent out a notice that no more options positions may be opened for GME this week.

The exchange itself is on the other side! The Nasdaq CEO is suggesting a trading halt to allow big investors to ‘recalibrate their positions’ and that they will engage FINRA and the SEC if ‘we see a significant rise in social media chatter”. [**https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html**](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html) 

Who was there for us when we got screwed over? **Nobody**. 

“These small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.” WTF?!? We’ve redistributed billions of wealth away from the ultra-rich, and you’re worried about us getting hurt? **This reads like a feudal lord trying to protect his serfs from the “dangers of freedom”.** Piss off. 

Now that we’ve established that these people are pieces of shit enriching only themselves. First things first. 

# Fundamentals.

This company is still (even at $350!) only trading at a multiple of 3.7x 2020 revenue. Stocks like Blink Charging are literally trading at 1000x 2020 revenue. Why the hell are they complaining about fundamentals now? Chewy is trading at 25x 2020 revenue. If Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into an e-commerce business with even a quarter of the success as Chewy - this stock literally DESERVES to be valued at $1000. That puts it at 10x LTM revenue. 

Putting aside balance sheet fundamentals… GME will reach $1000 and that is a conservative estimate. With a short ratio of 6 (days to cover), and pure anger at the establishment raging around the entire US - scratch that, THE WORLD, this PT will be reached with ease.

# LASTLY. The light at the end of the tunnel.

Everyone from the SEC to CNBC to the Nasdaq CEO to the brokerages are fuming at us and they are ready to pull out any damn trick in the book to make this end. Here is the lowdown on what to do next and why none of their threats matters. 

&#x200B;

1. Moves? Buy buy buy buy buy. If you cannot buy options, buy shares. If you can’t buy options or shares, use an alternate broker. If you don’t have one, file a formal complaint against your broker. [https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?\_afrLoop=2348712962026382&\_afrWindowMode=0&\_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o\_19](https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?_afrLoop=2348712962026382&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o_19) The SEC may not do anything about it, but having a formal complaint open strengthens the case for the future of civil action. 
2. SEC: The time has inevitably come that the SEC is actively snooping around here. Looking for signs of collusion. Some have said that we need to consider getting a megaphone, an official Twitter account to represent us. But to be honest, that actually seems like the last thing we want. The decentralization of this sub is its power. What is the SEC going to do? Arrest all of us? Track us all down? There is little they can realistically do. Worrying about the SEC directly should not be a priority (unless the investigation is being perpetuated by someone powerful, like the NASDAQ exchange itself is attempting to do).
3. News media? There is just so much misinformation misrepresenting this sub’s position along with CNBC absolutely denigrating us and putting out misleading news reports. “Epic Bubble is Building. Its Less Frothy in China” “You Will Lose Your Money Very Quickly” “GameStop analyst calls it a pyramid scheme” These are literal article titles from CNBC trying to lure us away. All I can do is facepalm at these moron’s hypocrisy. We literally just like the stock. Thank god for guys like Chamath. He is only guy on the other side I heard speak up for us today. There is only one thing we can do here. Never forget. One day it will bite them for being on the wrong side of history.
4. Exchanges threats to halt the market? They can do whatever tf they want. A halt won’t magically bring the price back down. 
5. And the juicy part. Nasdaq exchange threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC? I think we need a full trading hours GME ticker ban. Or a blackout for all posts, period. The only thing we have to remember is that WE LIKE THE STOCK. And Diamond Hands.

Regulatory intervention? Not really afraid of that, this should hopefully be over before the speed of government does anything.

We need to talk about NOK,1727,l6rmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6rmkl/we_need_to_talk_about_nok/,640,1611850644.0,"I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: I've got a lot of messages, here are my answers to the most common ones:

Remember, I'm an idiot. I don't know shit. I see cheap NOK, I like cheap NOK, I buy cheap NOK. I'm not a stockbroker or anything. All I know is it's a healthy, undervalued company with massive upside potential, new space tech etc. There is downside risk, but the risk is smaller than the potential. So if you invest 5k, you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days.

Would I bet a dollar to win 100, if yesterday everyone who bet added 50% to their money? Yeah. Might lose a quarter, but could gain 100 dollars.

Do I know it's definitely going to happen? Of course not. What happened yesterday, 1bn NOK shares traded, HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

In brief, the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Political

You hear the big fucks coming in talking about SEC investigation, stopping GME from trading and what not.

We already have DD on why there is nothing illegal happening here but I present the human angle.

Before anything, politicians need our vote. It is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck.

The optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face. The People against Evil Melvin.

Tendies don't have a party. This sub doesn't have a party. Right now we don't care who the autist next to us votes for, all we know is GME gang gang will tear 🌈🐻 a new one and we'll be rich and celebrate together from doing so.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

We are in the right here. Melvin and co. can whine about it but any intervention on GME will be seen as foul play. Good luck getting a single vote out of any GME holder if they try fucking with us.

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

NOK IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY,965,l6r0w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6r0w0/nok_is_not_going_to_make_you_money/,363,1611848221.0,"To all the new users browsing this sub, I know NOK may look like the easy investment out of all the meme stocks being talked about right now. After all, it’s only $6 while GME is $300+, so it might moon just like GME did right!?!

WRONG. There’s more to stocks than just its price. Let me teach you something about outstanding shares and market cap.

Market cap = total shares x stock price

Right now the market cap of NOK is 37 billion while GME is 24.24 billion. This makes NOK have GREATER value than GME, NOT less.

In other words, GME IS CHEAPER THAN NOK.

For NOK to jump to $100 a share, that would mean it’s market cap increases by a bit more than 15 times, making it worth 555 BILLION. If it matches GME’s $300 price, that would make it worth over $1 TRILLION. To put things into perspective, if GME was worth $1 trillion, its stock price would be over $13,000!

The main takeaway is: STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PRICE OF THE STOCK. IT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING.

The more outstanding shares there are also means the harder it is to move the stock. There’s WAY more NOK shares out there than GME, so good luck getting that to go anywhere.

Finally, GME is the only stock being shorted as heavily as it is. If you don’t know what this means, just know that it means it has more moon potential.

tl;dr: NOK is a distraction. It’s not going to $100. There’s more to a stock than its price. Learn something called “market cap” and “shares outstanding.” Load up on GME. See you at $10,000 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: Buying NOK cause it’s cheap and you think it’ll get you more gains than GME is like bringing a bus to the Daytona 500 and thinking you’ll finish first cause you have the biggest engine

EDIT 2: I’m not bringing up valuations cause I think valuations mean shit in this market. They don’t. Anyone with half a brain cell can see that.

I’m bringing it up to SHOW people the relative value of NOK compared to GME so that they don’t think “oh it’s so high already, it’s not gonna go any higher. NOK is low though so it must!!”

This is not even to mention the fact that the more overvalued you are, the harder it is to increase your overall value. It’s easy to go 10x from a market cap of 1B, but it gets harder to go from 10B to 100B, 100B to 1T, etc. The fact that I even have to add this cause you guys are missing my point just shows that the hedge funds are winning in manipulating you guys to spread us out from GME

We’re living in a defining, once in a generation opportunity right now. 

Because of that, euphoria is also at an all time high where pretty much 100% of the sub believes there’s no chance we can lose from here on out, including me. As long as we keep buying and 💎👐 the shorts will have to close, and we'll all be rich while simultaneously punishing the excessively greedy. 

However, there are very few gaurantees in life and I've yet to see a post to discuss ways we could all possibly get blindsided and left holding bags while waiting for the shorts to close. 

This is probably not an exhaustive list and I am in no way an expert (definitely an idiot). It's merely meant to get us thinking and ancipating our reaction if there's evidence that any of these or other risks is likely to happen. Basically I want the actually smart people to come in an explain why I'm wrong and/or add more risks not in this list. 

1. The SEC determines GME etc. are too big of a risk and suspends trading for 10 days.

What would the reaction be from the hedges that are short and retail investors? Would they still be able to close somehow during that period? Would it fuel the rebellion even more and drive the price even higher when trading resumes? 


2. The Hedge Funds, media, etc. scare tactics and lies work, trigging a waterfall of paper hands selling. 

There is a ton of misinformation being intentionally circulated right now and we are vulnerable because of it. Stuff like ""Melvin has already closed, has to close completely by Friday, the open short % is a lot smaller than we think, bots are trying to distract us from GME, etc."" The question is, what signs should we look for that sentiment is changing and hands are getting weaker in case some of their tactics stick? 


3. Melvin has already started to close under our noses.

Is this even possible? Many sources seems to indicate the short percentage has barely changed and that their statment about ""repositioning"" to close GME is complete BS. The volume and price action trends seem to show that is the case as well, but is there a scenario where Melvin could close without initiating a gamma squeeze (assuming we continue to hold)? 


4. Melvin and other short sellers get the option to close their shorts with cash instead of shares

We are gobbling up shares like crazy to try and fuel the squeeze. However, is there a possibility the share lender would let the shorts pay back the shares in cash instead of shares, therefore not causing more of a squeeze?

As I said this is probably not a complete list and maybe some of these aren't actually risks. Anyway, let's talk about these and any others I may have missed so that no matter what happens, we have a plan to deal with it and make sure we're all benefitting as much as possible from this wild experience.

This is a strange coincidence given that Citadel bailed out Melvin's risky bet on $GME to the tune of $2.75 billion.

It's also probably just a coincidence that the purchasing of large tranches of OTM $GME options were responsible for the gamma squeezes we've been seeing (as MMs bought shares to cover these options), and a big enough gamma squeeze could eventually create a tipping point for the MOASS.

This company has 10 shares, which are traded freely in a market, lets say they trade for $1. This share has been shorted 14 times. Each of those shorts has a margin account of $1, in total $14 exists to guarantee their short positions. For each $1 of stock, $1.4 of collateral is present (the tendies).

Lets say, savvy investors realize that the $1 investment corresponds to $1.4 of capital of the short side of the trade, and bid the price up to $2. Now, at that price, shorts are required to provide $2 per share in margin. Now each $2 outlay corresponds to $2.8 of short capital. So, on and so forth $4 and $4.8, until enough short positions are covered or are liquidated, that each marginal investment of $1 nets less than or equal to $1 in short capital, as long as shorts keep meeting margin calls.

Assuming an even split of long and short recouping the difference, the value of a share of GameStonk is literally worth a multiple of itself, 1.2 with current 140% short interest..

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

**Jim Cramer:** A real life Ephialtes. Looks like him too. Genuinely wants to be a Spartan, but in the end will sell our stops to Melvin Capital so they can attack our position from the rear.

We'll do this to simplify what's going on here, and what's going to happen.

This person is you. You know that there are extremely greedy hedge funds who borrowed and sold the shares to you, betting GME goes to zero. You know that there are extremely greedy lenders that literally lent out shares they didn't even have, just to collect a little more interest on loans.

If you just hold, just sit tight, refuse to sell, the hedge fund shorts will hemorrhage from the absurdly high interest payments on the loaned shares.

It gets even better. If even one person has a single share sold short, in theory you could bankrupt that person by refusing to sell. You hold immense power and control now.

Knowing this, you offer anybody trapped in a short position a lifeline. You say ""hey, I'll let you live, I just need 90% of your net worth for these shares."" What would that person do when faced with the choice between bankruptcy and starting over with 10%? Obv buy the shares back. 

It's literally name your own price now. We have them in checkmate, you just cannot sell. They are fucking terrified because they got caught.

If you own GME and REFUSE TO SELL, then *in theory* the value of a share is equal to the (sum total net worth of everybody and every fund who short sold just one or more shares divided by the total number of GME shares) times 0.90 or so to let them off the hook. They would pay you that.

Now, back to the hive.

I'll let the game theoreticians figure out what happens when you add selling pressure to the WSB swarm. Selling pressure will be a function of risk tolerance. For example, paper hands sell when the GME share they have exceeds 5% of their net worth, etc. We need to estimate average net worth of a GME long, and average risk tolerance.

The game theoretic equilibrium state of a long vs short war probably looks like 50% of shares sold short, 50% longs. The shorts are trying to get the longs to sell, and the longs are trying to get the shorts to buy. 

In this current state, I believe so long as GME is above 50% short interest, the stock will continue to rise. What are your thoughts reddit, when will the game....stop?",2021-01-28 16:48:23

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

Also, a boatload of memes, ""can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop"" quotes, and if awards were a stock they would be spiking in value due to this subreddit. 

Inevitably there will be a movie and more of the truth will come out that this is a random group of retail investors and that hedge funds are the ones who should be investigated by the SEC for decades of privately sharing information and swaying the market with their price targets and interviews on the news. 

Not only are us retail investors curtailed on various platforms on when we can trade and what types of trades we execute pre/post market there is already information asymmetry with the information hedge funds with deep pockets can pay for and what we have access to. Yet somehow, sharing information publicly where even hedge funds can view it is seen by these delinquents as ""unfair"". I call bull and also call a Netflix movie on all this!

- Elon, cause wtf not

As of yesterday, I calculated that $154 was the average short price based on the total number of shares short vs volume held (new shorts are entering as others are closing out, which means the average short price will be going up).

The closer this price is to the actual share price, it would mean many have covered, right now since it's half the share price, I'm inferring most have not covered yet.

Other important price targets are basically the call expirations for 1/29. If the share price is above the strike prices, the more contracts will get executed thus further gamma squeeze.


Edit:
based on data posted here, I'm estimating that about 30M shorts exited, 15M shorts entered, another 5M maybe exited AH so avg short price at $204 with 40M+ short outstanding, 80%+ of float

this is a conservative estimate, meaning actual short interest may be much higher

There are legitimately WSB millionaires made off this one play. This is history, and I'm glad to have witnessed it.

But I'm seeing a worrying trend here. People are beginning to make this into a moral crusade against ""the man"". Taking down the hedge funds because of their over-greed is no longer a way to make crazy money, it's a moral imperative. Giving advice to hold GME forever, just to punish them.

WSB is not the only thing driving GME up. WSB first noticed it and so we got in early, but other players are also involved. We cannot squeeze Melvin to infinity. Eventually, the position will be closed.

I don't know where the top of GME is. It might be $500. It might be $1000. It might be $10,000. But eventually, the stock will revert to its fundamental value. It happens with every short squeeze every time. And someone is going to be caught holding the bag.

If you are one of those ""I'm holding forever"" people, that person losing all their money is going to be you. The stock is going to crash from $100,000 or wherever it ends up, and when you finally decide to sell Robinhood is going to freeze for 15 minutes and it will congratulate you on your $6 sell. Meanwhile the institutional investor with their real broker made a killing. 

Now I can't wait for the loss porn that is coming to this sub in a month any more than the rest of you. That's what this sub is about. But when that happens, remember, it wasn't ""the man"" who made you lose all your money. You were the one who decided to hold at GME $1,000,000 to fuck Melvin. And you loved the feeling of that green dildo so much that you didn't notice the giant red one coming straight for your ass.

I saw the post with the NY Times article that Point72 is down 15% because its backstopping Melvin Capital. I thought it would be smart to review their holdings to see what is going on.  It certainly looks like holdings are being sold off to generate capital.

**However, I think this is a play by Point72 to get people to jump on the bandwagon and push them them down further, which is exactly what they want.**

In reality, I think it is more likely that Point72 pivoted to puts and are fire selling long positions to drive the price down.  Could they be pissed at the Market Makers for the GME blow up?  Would the MM be left holding the bag for this play? If that's the case, there is excellent smoke screen with the Melvin Backstop ""losses"" and Point72 needing to get more liquid Friday last week.

**I speculate they literally ran one fucking algorithm on every single one of their long positions. It bought PUTS Monday 10:15-10:30am and then it sells off huge volume of shares everyday at 3:45pm.  Selling large volumes of shares into the close to ensure it is low, swing the after/pre markets lower, so its a gap down open and closer to strikes. The small spikes on Monday around 10:30AM could be the Market Makers buying the underlying positions to hedge?**

What do you do? I have no fucking clue. You could try and hitch a ride? This isnt investment advice. Just be careful this is market wide deep pocket shit that I am too smoothbrained to game.  Probably fucked on my non-gme calls.

**Okay Autists. I know this is long, with a lot of numbers and concepts, but bear with me. This is good stuff.**

When I was watching the trading today on GME, I noticed something strange regarding the price action and the volume. If you noticed overall today, GME traded around 94 Million shares total. Yesterday total shares were 178 Million. Day before that 177 Million. Day before that, 197 Million. The day before that, 93 Million. Ever since we started ripping up in price, the volume has been around 200 million shares per day. But today, when the price was so high, and with so much volatility (change in price), the total volume was only 94 Million!!! If you look at the one minute chart, by the end of the day average volume per minute was 98 K / minute. And during these crazy downward dips throughout the day, the volume was sometimes as low as 8K. 8k out of 50 million float = 0.016%. That means 0.016% of the total shares changed the price so much!! This doesn’t make sense. Yesterday’s average volume/ minute was 500K per minute. Which makes sense for the crazy price movement we had yesterday.

**I think the reason why we had crazy lows and highs today was because of short selling.**

Short selling from day traders who want to make quick profits in the day and get out by the end. Once we hit $385/ share (premarket high – day trading short sellers like to use premarket high as a good short starting point because they know a lot of long day traders and paperhanded autists will sell at that point), the short selling day traders came in and started shorting hard to make their quick profits. That’s why you see the borrowed shares on iborrowdesk.com low around these times. And you have been seeing it fluctuate throughout the last few days. So I think these day trading short sellers were pushing the stock down the whole time, and when the end of the day approached, they covered their position, and we went back up to 344 close, and 373 (close to premarket high where we dropped during the day) during the first minute of after hours.

**Why is this good?**

Because that shows us these massive dips in the day are not because large amounts of autists and every day people are selling, but because the day trader shorts are synthetically pushing the price down. That means we’ve been diamond handing. And even better, the normies are all diamond handing too. Guys, this is on the verge of the squeeze! Don’t sell and let this shit ride. I believe if we can push past 385 tomorrow, this shit will rip, as no short selling day trader will want to risk getting squeezed. And the crazy enough ones that do will trigger moderate length shorters to cover. Which will have the stock break out higher. Causing the breakout and momentum traders to come join us for the fight. Shit’s gonna rip. One hedge fund gets liquidated… more covering… another hedge fund. 

**Domino effect guys. Game over.**

Some of you may argue that TDameritrade and other brokers prevented trading GME, so that’s why the volume was low. But check this out, AMC was on that TDameritrade block list too! And they traded 1.19 Billion shares today. That’s billion with a B. With the average share per minute 2 million/ minute. And we only traded 197 Million. This is not normal. Not normal for a stock that’s breaking headlines.

I highly encourage everybody to go and dig up the charts - particularly the AH charts from 6:30 PM EST until the time that WSB came back from privacy lock to audit and verify the veracity of what I'm saying (because I'm too damned lazy to screen grab them and upload them and link them etc.).

&#x200B;

Lads,

&#x200B;

What you saw tonight was nothing short of the most coordinated disinformation and psy-op strike ever conducted by the insiders of Wall Street, perpetuated upon the retail traders of Main Street.  It drew heavily upon Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, the agility of John Boyd, the robber barony of Rockefeller, and the deviousness of Tywin Lannister.  Let's examine the course of this day:

&#x200B;

# First, the PsyOps

\-First, they sought to control the narrative using figureheads (the media).  Everything from taking Andrew Left's accusations of threats against his children at face value to claiming that a bunch of day traders somehow hacked a hedge fund, they were on full blast all day on TV and in print about how retail was the villain.

&#x200B;

\-Then, they spread misinformation.  The headline on Marketwatch this morning was something along the lines of ""Reddit already plotting its endgame to take the money and run"" or something.  It was like this everywhere.

&#x200B;

\-Then, they found ""experts"" willing to go on TV and shill these narratives to create FUD in anyone who wasn't on the rocket yet, or to create fear to inspire paper hands to sell by making wild accusations about how the SEC is going to suspend trading for 30 days or investigate people for collusion or how if this continues, there will be punishments doled out in the form of reduced access to markets.  CNBC was especially guilty of this.  At some point they even suggested that if you bought one of these meme stocks, it was possible you were helping a ""foreign agent"" like Iran overthrow the government by exploiting a strip-mall video game vendor.

&#x200B;

\-Then, they attempted to turn potential allies into enemies by claiming that, because these hedge funds who were completely innocent for shorting 140% of a stock were being brought to their knees and forced to liquidate their long positions, that we were responsible for the larger drop in the market because we were shaking MM's.  Just to put an exclamation point on this, an obvious assault on market prices in the power hour, sending everything but the meme stocks sharply lower by creating liquidity vacuums was orchestrated that took the markets down like 3%.  Because of 1 company worth 2% of Amazon.

&#x200B;

\-To tie it all home, they timed their afternoon messages to coincide with devastating actions against the ""insurgents"".  What, you think it was pure coincidence that the ""breaking news"" that Discord had banned the Discord server occurred at the EXACT moment CNBC and Bloomberg were talking about WSB?  If you believe that, I've got a bridge for you.  To tie a bow on that, they made a point to point out that, because the Discord server was a bit of a cesspool that it means everybody in WSB is a Nazi.  Because it's easier to stop allies from rallying to a cause if the enemy is dehumanized.    And, of course, all these actions happen AFTER the closing bell.

&#x200B;

# And then, the ambush....

\-But the most egregious and flat out evil move?  Happened at 5 pm, almost on the dot.  Suddenly, in AH trading inhabited almost exclusively by brokers, a VERY SPECIFIC group of equities - GME, NOK, BB, AMC, and BBBY - absolutely PLUMMETED in value.   Curiously, almost NO OTHER STOCK anywhere on the market had this kind of move.  JUST these stocks.  Quite a coincidence, eh ?  Now it's easy to blame this on the privatization of WSB, sure, but look deeper....

&#x200B;

# Inside the numbers, and how they pulled off the biggest psychological attack of all:

&#x200B;

The sub isn't why these equities collapsed.  The great thing about AH trading is the volume is so low that you can actually watch individual trades go through in real time.  Shares of these meme companies were being sold....1 or 2 shares at a time, and they were being sold for a few cents less each time, until the Depth Chart ran into a quantity of shares, and then all of a sudden a slightly larger burst of buy orders would come in.  They walked these 5 stocks down a few cents at a time until they found gaps where there was absolutely no sell action, at which time a sell would be created at a lower number just above the next order.

&#x200B;

# What was actually going on:

&#x200B;

Colluding firms were orchestrating this to hunt for stop loss orders and to systematically drive down the price when there was almost nobody around to buy dips or watch it happen.  They were ""buying"" individual  quantity  shares from each other at progressively lower numbers in their hunt while everybody else was eating dinner or watching CNBC hearing about the Nazis of Reddit.  They positively COLLAPSED the price of these 5 stocks - the privatization of WSB (which news media dutifully referred to as a ""suspension"") was done to create a sense of panic in anybody who held equity in one of these companies in the hopes that they would pull the cord and bail out because the epicenter of the movement had been destroyed after a long day of psychological manipulation to condition everybody to view that epicenter as bad and untrustworthy, and their life's savings had just been hammered.  All under cover of darkness.   And it was performed with an absolute bear minimum of actual stocks - just a couple thousand total changing hands over and over.  Don't just take my word for it, go look at the movement.  You know a lot of people out there who just have to trade 2 shares of a 7 dollar stock after hours?

&#x200B;

# Did it work?

# 

Hard to say.  What's not hard to say is that WSB coming back into public mode certainly plugged the maneuver - one which would have taken these companies down by 80% had counter-information had not been brought back.  But I'm sure a lot of people panic sold, and even more will log in tomorrow to see bright red losses and figure the game is over, so on some level it's clearly done something.  BUT....you can actually look at a GME chart and see the exact moment this sub came back, because the march downwards immediately reversed and the equity recovered almost 50 dollars in share price to get back up near the $300 mark.

&#x200B;

# Are you going to be OK?

  
Depends on if you have a strong stomach, and if those who also believe in the companies you believe in have a strong stomach as well.  I've been asked a couple of times tonight if these big firms - which have transitioned from trying to use their money to bully everyone to outright OVERTLY rigging the game and cheating because they were losing under their own already unbalanced ruleset - could continue to swing big dick to wreck everyone.  

&#x200B;

And the answer, at least with the heavily shorted of these meme stocks, is no (a couple of these are not heavily shorted).  Everything they've done has been psychological manipulation and smoke screening.  They're still backed into a corner, just like they were 9 hours ago.  They're still facing absolutely monstrous losses.  Nothing they've done has gotten them away from that.  Everything they've done has been to your mind.  They haven't gained any ACTUAL strength.    They can't control volume because they can't create shares, at least not  for more than one day.  Which is why they resort to parading out an  endless string of ""experts"" on tv casting retail as the villain and  making the show hosts dance for their masters.   But as long as people don't fall for it, these moves will not only not work, but blow up in their face because the public sentiment is now so far against them that there's a risk of a full on revolt of the entire internet against big investment.  The internet has EXPLODED in outrage that has the makings of the same type of powder keg that ignited the Occupy Wall Street movement....except this isn't one that you can just turn your head and walk past or ignore.  The story has morphed from ""retail investors find someone with their hand in the cookie jar, those scamps"" to one of ""class warfare"".  You can't control the internet, and they just attempted to do that.  When you fail, it makes things 10 times worse.  

&#x200B;

But they're going to keep pulling shit  like this to try and get people to sell in a panic, because it's literally the only card left in their deck.",2021-01-28 15:45:10
"Citadel, Melvin - Why Options didn't trade for 15 mins today. Long GME, go 🐻on SPY QQQ",671,l6p406,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6p406/citadel_melvin_why_options_didnt_trade_for_15/,234,1611840822.0,"Like many of you I woke up today trying to see if I was gonna hit my second M and was a little shocked at seeing that I couldn't get a bid or ask on any options that I had. I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.

I've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.

Questions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for

1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?
2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?
3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?

I suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.

Look at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.

I made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been\_too\_long\_since\_weve\_had\_a\_bearpocalypse\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been_too_long_since_weve_had_a_bearpocalypse_post/)

Citadel is almost BK and everyone can fucking smell it. We get one last big green on GME IMO and that will be the death kneel of Citadel. I don't know if it happens thursday, or friday, but it's coming. You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them. IF you see market red as shit tomorrow, you buy index puts and puts on whatever Melvin and Citadels longs were and you lean into it because not only is Citadel going to liquidate but the whole market is likely to go with it.

Good luck

The $GME Short Thesis and how it could backfire if retail investors behave rationally,1813,l6os3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6os3d/the_gme_short_thesis_and_how_it_could_backfire_if/,468,1611839668.0,"So I'm seeing a lot of information out here about Melvin and 6 days to cover and all that and I think a lot of it is outdated. Actually, I know it's outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $GME has risen like 300% since then. There's been a huge amount of price action, and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and there's still tons of short interest. What gives? Why haven't the shorts learned their lesson? Are they just stupid? Maybe. But maybe not... Let's consider the short's view on this situation:

**The $GME Short Thesis as of 1/27:** Here's the scene. A stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks. You know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario. However, volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action, so the days to cover is falling, making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window. Meanwhile, older long retail investors (aka bought like a day ago) are staring at what are, to them, very nice gains. It's been several days of insane price action already, and people are predicting the end is near because, well, it must be, right? The uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high.

You look at this and predict the following: **retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move, causing a chain reaction of sell-offs**. In other words, you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action (could be either way) and then there's going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price. 

So what do you do as a short with that thesis? Short the stock, of course! **Even if there's tremendous upwards price action the next day, you can just sell short again, pay off the old loan with the new short money, and now you're in an even better position.** Your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops. High interest rates from your lender don't bother you because, based on the thesis, you're only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted. This is why short interest is still strong - it's generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon.

**How the Short Thesis could fall apart:** So, the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $GME positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that ""the end is near."" But here's the thing: what if they don't? As an investor in $GME myself, I did the following with my gains - I sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now I'm just sitting on the rest as ""house money."" I'm not buying in anymore because I'm managing risk, but I'm not pulling out because I think there's more juice to squeeze and I've got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping. If this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors (and it's a pretty classic and intuitive investing/gambling strategy), volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau. 

So as a short, aren't you happy that the price stopped rising? HELL NO. You need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up. $GME remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short. You've taken out a huge loan, you're paying huge interest, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses - when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes. I think this is the scenario in which we'd see a true MOASS.

**Disclaimer: I am just a guy on the internet. I don't have specialized education in the market, but I think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the MOASS might develop. I could be totally wrong! Let me know what you think about it in the comments**

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, ""[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273),"" as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this.

I speak for myself here and no one else (and no one else here speaks for everyone else either).  Feel free to DM for more facts and context.

CNBC, whether its true or not, the past 3 days have made EVERYONE honestly believe that you are truly bought out by Wall Street, in every sense. You’ve paraded “analyst” after analyst, hedge fund manager after manager, boomer after boomer, to try and demonize and deflect blame for the GameStop situation.

**Firstly, your contributors need to stop pretending they don’t know short squeeze mechanics.**

You’ve had dozens of people on your air whining about how no one in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) cares about fUnDaMeNtALs and VaLuATiOn regarding GameStop. OF COURSE, we don’t care about GME’s fundamentals *anymore*, because we are in a SQUEEZE. We are in a squeeze in which the Shorts have DOUBLED-DOWN constantly. That means OF COURSE the price keeps going into the stratosphere. Do you actually believe your own lie that the Shorts like Melvin have closed out? I don’t, and we have data that agrees. Why would we sell our shares “’fair value”” if the squeeze isn’t done?

Secondly, most of us are well aware that GME isn’t a $100billion company, or whatever $5000/share is. I think we are all very much aware that we are in the middle of a short squeeze, NOT price discovery.

*This does not mean that our interest in GME was not a* ***value-based thesis*** *at first*.

Our most famous GME long u/ DeepF\*\*kingValue has been in GME since 2019.([!!!](https://t.co/TengJuA7O9?amp=1)). There are others here who I’m sure joined at some point way back when. If you want more credibility, the famous Michael Burry and some dudebro Donald Foss both entered large positions in GME a long time ago. These people believed in the **FUTURE** ***VALUE*** of GME. They saw that savage, unrelenting short sellers like Melvin had *pounded* the share price into the ground, actively and immorally aiming for bankruptcy. Retail bought in in September because Ryan Cohen saw enough **value** to buy stock. The price jumped to $13/share in November because Ryan Cohen expressed his vision for a turnaround that people saw a ton of future **value** in. The big spike happened when Cohen n co. joined the BOARD OF DIRECTORS at GME. Why are your hosts and “analysts” pretending that these things didn’t happen?

And the whole while, Melvin and Shorts were DOUBLING DOWN on their positions, which were already part of the preposterous, irresponsible and potentially illegal +100% short interest. And even now (as far as we know), the short interest IS STILL **OVER 100%**. STOP PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN. You’ve had people constantly claiming that the prices are reaching these levels “for no reason” and that the initial bullish sentiment was created “out of thin air”. The people who keep saying these things, including your hosts, are either willfully ignorant or acting in bad faith.

Good, decent people provided their Due Diligence on this subreddit. They pointed out the $6.4billion in revenue in 2019. They pointed out the E-commerce sales *tripling* YOY. They pointed out the ability to easily pay off debt. They even called HUNDREDS of GameStops, where we found out they were constantly selling out of inventory, AND have plans of having PC-building-stations in-store. They pointed out the rapidly expanding Gaming Market, and the ability to grab substantial market share. And yes, they pointed out the 140% short interest, **BUT PEOPLE DID NOT START BUYING $GME SOLELY BECAUSE OF SHORT INTEREST**. Smart or not, honest people here bought into GME initially as a **value** play. They did their homework. They found data. They showed proof of positions. This brings me to my third point:

In the entire time I have been on wallstreetbets, we have NEVER “targeted” a stock or hedge fund JUST to bust the shorts. Short-busting is not who WSB is. Those are the kids on TikTok, or the grifters on Twitter. Every single *popular* thesis on here has been backed up with [research](https://t.co/1ab5ppItOo?amp=1), [financial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and quality (depending on who you ask) discussion. Just because we talk like, stupid people, doesn’t mean we don’t say smart things. And maybe our ideas DO end up backfiring (see: [$PRPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcbj0n/final_score_on_prplw_32m_gain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3])), and MAYBE 85% of the members don’t know what theta decay is, but we do *not* pull stocks out of thin air, as you’ve claimed.

People here genuinely believe in these stocks. People here believe in Ryan Cohen, and the potential for GameStop to be reinvented. People believe in Blackberry’s future (present) as a rock solid software company. This brings me to my final issue:

It is disingenuous and plainly incorrect to blame every. single. price increase. on the “reddit rebellion” and short squeezes. STOP saying we are going after $BBBY – there hasn’t been a substantive post in 4 months on that. STOP saying we are pumping $NOK – we’ve advocated for leap calls in NOK for MONTHS because *we know* we cannot wait out their giant share float. And for JPow’s sake, ***STOP BLAMING US FOR A***\[movie company\]***MC, EX***\[clothing store\]***PR, AND IRBT. TWO OF THOSE TICKERS ARE LITERALLY BANNED FROM THIS SUBREDDIT, AND THE OTHER ISN’T EVEN REAL TO US. WE CANT EVEN TYPE THEM INTO A POST WITHOUT GETTING AUTO-DELETED.***  People who try to pump a stock for no reason are BANNED.  Yes, because of the events of this month, and because of the actions of groups like Citron, many people are happily engaging in one particular short squeeze. But that’s it. Yes, retail is more powerful than you may know, but we are not *that* powerful.

If you or anyone else reading this are wondering why there seems to be more internet chatter on that *one* particular movie company, hear this: *SOMEONE* has been creating fake accounts and BOTS to spam and pump up \[movie company\] and $nok, etc. to distract from GME. Ask the admins. Look at Chamath’s twitter replies. Look at **ALL** OF FINANCE TWITTER. There are newly created accounts and bots spamming the hell out of these other stocks in an effort to *manipulate* the market and save the shorts. Jeez, I wonder who is behind that? **Could it be the same group of people who bought $1.2million of GME puts right before** [**tweeting something?**](https://t.co/Fz1aTbMa2p?amp=1)

If anyone in the void is reading this, thanks. The point of this post was just to fight back in a tiny way against the days and days of whining millionaires on TV berating people they literally know nothing about. It’s to point out the ignorance of self-serving boomers saying things like “the SEC needs to regulate  *the* Reddit”, etc. The point of this post was just to get our little corner of truth out there in the world, because we all know that truth is in short supply. 🚀

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is.

Charitably-Minded Autists,282,l6ofoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ofoh/charitablyminded_autists/,42,1611838548.0,"Probably doesn't belong here, but I honestly don't think the Submission Guidelines were written with these kinds of gains in mind.

Many of you probably know this already, but if you're charitably minded you can really maximize your gift by donating APPRECIATED stock directly to charity instead of selling (incurring tax) and gifting cash.

A few fine print items to note:

-Donating stock that you have held for less than a year (short term gain) limits your deduction to your original investment (basis) to the stock. If you have held the stock for long term, you get to deduct the fair market value at the time of the gift. (💎✊)

-Charitable deductions are below-the-line deductions, meaning that you would need to itemize your deductions in order to get proper credit. If you take the standard deduction instead, your maximum deduction is $300.

-Your gains are added to your Adjusted Gross Income. If you do itemize and want to claim deduction you need to understand that your deduction is capped based on your AGI and the type of property you are donating. For cash, you can deduct up to 60% of AGI. For appreciated stock, you can only deduct up to 30% of your AGI. The IRS permits a 5 year carry forward for charitable gifting if you exceed these limits.


None of this is tax or legal advice. I just like the stock.

First, let’s talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I’ve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I’m not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife’s boyfriend’s dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it’s 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don’t want to miss it.

TL;DR: Only sell when you see the price spikes up 5x, 10x, 100x from one day to a week. This is the way.

"The real DD on SLV, the worlds biggest short squeeze is possible and we can make history",5093,l6novm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/,1323,1611836076.0,"Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago.

First things first, **don't do this until the GME rise is done.**  Lets conquer one market at a time. I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after. Then again each person is an individual and that needs to be made clear as well.

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares and call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don’t have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.  

**If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months **

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

&#x200B;

**What to buy:**

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if we pull this off.

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don’t recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee’s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust’s silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian’s or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

Disclaimer: do your own research, make your own decisions, everything here is a guess and hypothetical and nothing is guaranteed, not a financial advisor, I have ADHD and maybe other things too. 

Bear case:  silver does tend to sell off if the broader market plunges so it’s not immune to broad market sell off.  It’s also the most manipulated market in the world so we are facing some tough competition on the short side",2021-01-28 14:14:36
Why $NOK won't squeeze and why it may be manipulation,220,l6nni2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6nni2/why_nok_wont_squeeze_and_why_it_may_be/,128,1611835943.0,"Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, I am retarded also and have 1/29 $5P and $4.5P on $NOK because I am not retarded and I understand basic market dynamics and I want free money. I am not advocating any plays.

Yeah bagholders, shills, and hedge fund bots I know you won't like this post but shut the fuck up and Ill try to save you some money and explain the bullshit as to why this stock has been shilled. Out of random this stock gets pumped up by new accounts saying its the next short squeeze. Lets take a look at it and compare it to the other short squeezes, $GME and $AMC.

# Short Interest (SI) Potential

Its no secret now why some weird market forces are acting on $GME and $AMC because of forced buying due to a short squeeze. In order to trigger a short squeeze you need huge short positions to trigger the forced buying after a price increase. If you need more than that to know what i mean look up a youtube video im not gonna hold your hand, put your big boy pants and learn it yourself smooth brain. GME has the retardedly high level of 140% (which is illegal) causing insane forced buying spiking it 6,700% from its pre-squeeze levels [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME). $AMC has about 37% SI and has squeezed about 500% since pre squeeze level [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC&ty=c&ta=1&p=d). Those market forces that caused those movements are not present in $NOK. **$NOK has a paltry, pitiful, incredibly low SI of 0.94%**[source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=nok&ty=c&ta=1&p=d) **!** There won't be that forced buying pressure from shorts being forced to close out.

# Gamma Squeeze potential

Okay you're still not convinced whatever fuck you read this too. If you don't know what a gamma squeeze look that shit up it isn't that hard to grasp and i'm not you dad so teach yourself. Today an insane amount of call options traded on them, sure, but that won't affect the price much. All call option open interest is 934,240 at close, which is just 93M shares worth underlying. Even if MM's are forced to buy shares because they are selling naked there are **5.6B shares outstanding on NOK.** Even if all those calls are naked (most probably aren't) then that's only 93,424,000 shares they have to purchase which is about 1.5% of shares outstanding [source](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NOK/options) if you look at the 1/29 call options. They could close those out so quickly and at no real price increase because there's no forced buying from shorts.

# Daily Volume

Okay bag holder you're impressed they traded over 1B shares today which is a record for NOK. That matters less than your basketball games did to your dad. That 1B share volume is less than 20% than shares outstanding, but today GME did 150% and AMC did 1200% so its nowhere even close in relative trading volume to the big boys. 1B seems big but it really aint in this context.

# Valuation

Yeah some of you have no idea what i said above and may never but before you go back to drooling on your keyboard lets take a look at valuations real quick. Before GME squeezed it had a Market cap of about 300M, and AMC had Market Cap of 600M. NOK is sitting at a 35B Market cap right now, it is many many magnitudes larger than those two. its not a small cap fallen from grace it is still a large cap stock. A large cap stock is a stock over 10B is it is 3.5x the minimum of a large cap, not punt GME or AMC.

# ""Its a 5G play""

yeah sure it is to some point, but the market knows everything about it already. It didn't come out with a new product, service, get a new PT or anything else. Its not 50% better than it was a few days ago on now news. Sure it may have been relatively undervalued but it went up 40% today and nothing is new. Im not saying it’s a dead company either just that it’s worth 35 fucking billion dollars already 

# Summary

This isn't a stock to buy to punish the hedge funds. All your calls are doing is handing free premium money to them and buying their shares at insane valuations.

# What do I think it is?

Who the fuck knows why so many pumpers are out there on this stock. Maybe some are hedge fund bots, maybe they have a record number of bagholders, maybe its people who love buying on the ""greater fool theory"". I don't know but what i do know is that its not the rocket ship a bunch of virgins are saying it is. All you're doing is buying hedge fund douchebag their 3rd wife's boob job and a new yacht to fuck them in.

Call your brokerage and demand compensation for today’s outage!

I left Robinhood because they always crashed....seeing this happen with TDA and all the other brokerages is highly suspicious as I’ve NEVER had an issue after the first minute or so after market open. 

They have no issue collecting fees on option trades, but when their shitty service breaks for 30 minutes they take zero responsibility.

My position was fucked around $450 and they cut me a credit for almost half the amount at $200+.

I reached out via the the Chat App within ThinkOrSwim and you better believe I took screenshots and videos when nothing was working for proof.

I LOVE THE MOVIES: Part 1,736,l6nblw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6nblw/i_love_the_movies_part_1/,281,1611834910.0,"TLDR: buy AMC shares. My position: 7600 shares at $14.78 cost basis.

How many people have you heard talking desperately about getting out of the house? About how “I just wish I could go to the movies again!” People are FED UP with being cooped up inside. As soon as spring/summer rolls around AMC is going to sell out every single showing. 

But people will be scared to go out still!!? But they will be careful!!!?

Bullshit. I’ve seen soccer moms and dads cut off locks from Chicago city playgrounds during the height of the pandemic just to get some playtime in for their kids. People are tired AF of waiting around at home and are desperate to go to the movies, buy some overpriced popcorn, and get 5 hours of sugar sweats from pounding a pound of sour patch kids.

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

What happens when movies sell out over and over again? Price hikes! What happens when prices get hiked on a product that has zero marginal cost like a movie license? Huge profits! What happens when you buy a coke for $15 that cost $0.30 cents? Huge profits! What happens when your labor cost is minimum wage because everyone is unemployed (ok nevermind they always paid minimum wage)? Huge profits! What happens when a year of huge profits allows you to reinvest in a new and better movie experience and drive further growth? Huge profits! What happens when the stock is immensely oversold short? Huge profits! 

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

I don’t know about you, but I grew up as a kid salivating at GameStop and thrilled to go to AMC. Let’s bring back the good ole days.

As if we're all so dumb that we don't realize these stocks can go down just like they can go up.  Motherfu\*\*er, have you even been through this subreddit?  We know exactly what the risks are.

This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.  We get it more than you do CNBC.  We know there is risk.  Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.  These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

So yeah, fuck off CNBC analysts and stop telling us you're worried we'll get hurt.  That's not your real worry.  Your worry is that we're exposing how rigged the system really is.",2021-01-28 13:53:40
They want to say we dont know fundamentals? 250% float isnt fundamental,2944,l6n6fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n6fx/they_want_to_say_we_dont_know_fundamentals_250/,361,1611834436.0,"Investopedia💎💎💎 has this article talking about shorts and floats:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:\~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest).

&#x200B;

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Note that the fundamental here is that it shouldnt be above 50%💸💸💸 normally, let alone 100%. It shouldnt even be an idea under normal circumstances. We didnt create this non-fundamental scenario. They did.

Also note that shorting is called ""SPECULATION."" Speculation is not wise, well informed investing😒😒. They are betting and they always warn that it is betting. They warn non-stop that you should be very careful. They scare you away from these massive profit potentials and hide behind complex ideas.

Once they start losing, they suddenly change their tune 🎶🎶. They claim we arent paying attention to fundamentals. That we are inexperienced and making dumb moves. This is the most shrewd, clever, intelligent market move made since the Big Short. The institutional investors got caught with their pants down 😘 in public and blame us for calling them out on it.

Market Makers are not the Market. They might think they are, but they aren't. You cant time the market, but you can damn well time shorts 😂😂😂.

The biggest risk we face (and why it's nothing to worry about for now),11962,l6n4ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/,1029,1611834253.0,"Greetings all. Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap.",2021-01-28 13:44:13

First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon.

With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized.

The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the ""DD filter"" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth.

Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted.

This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information.

With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or ""anti-establishment.""

I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit. I really think Fox Business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at CNBC.

Ok, so gather around, a proper DD incoming.

Nio is one of the stonks that most joys have brought me in WSB. Now backed by several big banks and some might consider it more institutional, but I still think it has the opportunity to have a **huge upside** like in the ol' days. In other words :

""Where there was fire, ashes remain""

Why do I think that? Because of the following:

1- Earnings will be astronomical for the stonk as **deliveries of vehicles** have been spectacular: **111% increase YOY.**

2- The company is always innovating as seen on demo day with the program related to self-driving.

3- **The company knows what its doing:** they offer shares to raise more capital and reinvest it to grow the company; they plan to open a new factory in Denmark to start covering Europe, charging stations are becoming extremely popular, and they are making a shitton of them

4- And finally they are in China if don't know about this country because you missed geography in school is the most populated country on earth and a major economic player in the world, so if the company reaches 2% of the population and sells to this 2% each year, guess how much that is? Let's do the math together to avoid mistakes: 1,393,000,000 \* 0.02 = 27,860,000. The point I'm trying to get across is that there is a lot of market to cover and expand. 

That's a lot of cars, and this is only considering china. If they start production and sell to other countries, we are looking at an incredible amount of sales, and sales lead to revenue, revenue leads to a company having a huge upside as it's a possible catalyst, and that leads you to have a stonk with a huge price increase, kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house and live in the most special place in the world: **Tendie town**, those sweet sweet tendies!

**Positions**: 200 NIO shares @ 58.36

What's my background? Well, I did a WSB fund with stonks in python using a max Sharpe ratio, that got banned because a certain stock at that moment was a low-cap, but if you followed that portfolio you would have outperformed the S&P this year by 1000% approximately.

I also published a post on PLTR when nobody gave a flying fuck about the stock and was trading at 23 USD with shitron shorting it and everybody saying it was completely overpriced. **You would be up by 66% if bag hold 'till today.**

**TLDR**: So buckle up, **$NIO** will fly again. By simple math and good management, this is meant to fly. 🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-28 12:52:24

Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don’t like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money. 

Hold strong in your convictions and if you’re in a certain stock remember why and do not let emotions take over. When you do, they win and you lose. And trust me when I say, we do not get a bail out.

The brokers have given us commission-free trading. Reddit, twitter, etc. have given us a collective hive mind where ideas can be nurtured, critiqued, developed, distributed, and acted upon in concert.

However, the government, hedge funds, brokers, et. al. still practice their dirty tricks to protect their own. We should fear the systematic risk of cronyism within the halls of government and Wall Street to put the brakes on our profit making, which is our lawful American right.

Should the SEC illegally or unjustly intervene on behalf of their friends (who so often reward government poodle regulators with lucrative jobs after leaving civil service), we will need to find a large law firm that specializes in securities and class actions and is willing to setup a trust account where you give your name, nominal retainer fee, and proof that you owned $GME to establish standing in a suit.

I've lurked this sub for over a year. Throughout the pandemic, this subreddit and the discord have been my home. I turned $800 into $20k, not the most money, but the most fun I've had in some time. You guys have made me laugh. You guys have made me cry with bad options plays. You guys have made a lonely time less lonely. I've never been more excited to see others make money while I watched on the side. 

Today, like us all, I've been reading through news. William Gavin, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told Barron's we should halt Gamestop for a month to let it cool down because ""small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.”

The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us. He said we are vulnerable. He said we are too ""unsophisticated"" to understand our risks. He said that shorts at least are sophisticated. Its so stupid its laughable. As if we are simply children mashing buttons. 

We are adults, with crayons.

So Bill, please tell us how vulnerable we are tomorrow. 


“I think the little guys you describe are probably the ones most likely to get hurt,” he said. “Those that are more sophisticated—who might be shorting—they may get hurt, but they’re more sophisticated. They probably understand the risk they’re taking.”

I don't need to give you an introduction into what's been going on here, so I'll get right into the pretty pictures.

**Strategy**

1. Get data on previous week’s WallStreetBets discussion from Quiver Quant API.
2. Identify the five most mentioned stocks.
3. Buy those stocks at the start of the trading week, sizing positions based on how much they were talked about in proportion to each other.
4. Sell positions at the end of the trading week.
5. Repeat

**Performance**

I initially considered examining the sentiment behind discussion of different tickers and constructing a market-neutral portfolio, but decided that taking short positions sounded like some bear shit and chose to steer clear.

Below is a visualization showing what the portfolio looked like every week. Note the bar sizes increasing and decreasing depending on how much capital we have to invest.

His excitement tries to cut through the field of regret the memory has sparked, but it can’t.

Explanation for noobs who don't quite understand what's going on...,13228,l6kgik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kgik/explanation_for_noobs_who_dont_quite_understand/,1331,1611826375.0,"Mods: does DD tag apply? If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't.

Thanks for all the awards guys! I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your Яetard Prince for the day! I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am. I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.

I'd like to thank the academy, and my parents who never believed in me, and Scruffy, my first dog, who, like WSB, played chicken with truck, and, and, and...

Also.

1. Everyday they try to cover their shorts and no one sells stock, the stock price would literally double.
2. Everyday they can't cover means they're BLEEDING money due to expensive interest rates they paid to borrow stock.
3. They're getting some help which only means we get more tendies. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT SELL, BLEEDING THEM ALL OUT.
4. They have their tactics and dirty tricks to trap investors but as long as you know why that's happening you'll be fine. Also know the next day they will try to cover again leading to a further rise in stock price. After hours is what they can control so seeing a 10-20% decline after hours don't mean shit.

A watershed moment in Financial Mathematics: What CNBC and the Hedge Funds don't want you to know,240,l6jhbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6jhbd/a_watershed_moment_in_financial_mathematics_what/,38,1611823778.0," When a party shorts a stock, it creates a liability to repurchase the stock at whatever the price is (unbounded). This liability is secured by the assets in the party's margin account. When the liability exceeds the amount of assets in the margin account, they face a margin call. Provide additional money or securities to cover the gap or we will liquidate your position and bill you for the remainder.

The monumental discovery which is in process is as follows: When over 100% of shares are short, the long position is effectively backed by the shorts, and becomes an infinite loop. If the market cap of a stock is $50Bn, there are $50Bn in margin assets backing this price. Thus stock is in a perpetual state of fair value as long as the over 100% condition holds and the shorts have the assets, regardless of price.

So now the hedge funds find themselves in a Chinese finger trap. To push their fingers together means to liquidate their positions and take enormous losses. To pull their fingers is to continue to provide margin as the price increase until they reach bankruptcy and lose everything. In their hubris, they were trying to pull.

As these funds and brokers employ tons of smart phds to understand this math, they have undoubtedly realized this, and hence they want to cut the trap. They have restricted retail trading to prevent this limitless outflow, they are trying to bully the regulators into backstopping their position, they may halt trading.

What is the maximum fair market cap of GME? It is as much capital as these hedge funds want to throw away, lambs to the slaughter, before they throw in the towel, and its first come first serve. What is the AUM of the remaining short funds, 50Bn? 100Bn? 200Bn? more?

As we have seen time and time again, the behavior of market participants is not rationale and is difficult to predict. People are ignorant of this mathematical fact, crying about the fundamental value of the retailer on CNBC. But big money is smart, they will figure out exactly how big the pot is, and they will snap it up. Even a country could do it.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial professional, nor is this financial advice, I'm just pointing out that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of this financial math. Make your own choices and invest responsibly (only what you can afford to lose). Lord knows they are doing anything they can legal or not to shut this down.

TLDR: The Math of over 100% short interest allows for 100% arbitrage losses from the short funds. This creates the possibility for the greatest transfer of wealth of all time.",2021-01-28 10:49:38

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

New shorts are pilling in, the “news” are building a narrative that a bunch of millennials - as if we don’t have several prominent boomers among us - are “targeting” Hedge Funds in “chat rooms” (mIRC much?) to create an irrational bubble and that this is a perfectly orchestrated multi-billion dollar operation!

Wanna talk about irrational? Irrational is to value GameStop at $4, with ~$2 in cash per share, a few months before a new console cycle is launched. Irrational is to keep naked short selling well above its available free float (morning start shows the most accurate free float imo) a company that has completed a major share buyback, turning inventory into cash, paying back their 6% LT debt early and attracting a major activist (sup RC? You’ve been quiet lately). 

How come there were no “news” about this? Is everyone sleeping? How come Bank of America has had a price target of $2 for GameStop (sorry, BofA increase their PT to $10 today) for months? And by the way, what has FUNDAMENTALLY changed for BofA to increase 5 fold their valuation of GameStop? What a bunch or crooks.

You wanna know what’s not irrational?

- GME has $7b in sales in the end of a console cycle and amidst lockdowns. 

- Out of those sales +1b is e-commerce that is growing 300% YoY

-+ 50m power up members (amazon prime has 150m members)

- an established and functioning sales and distribution network worldwide

- a healthy balance sheet. 

All that while operating in an industry with a crazy TAM, with growth rates above 30% and with THE MOST DESIRABLE demographic. 


And seriously, a 3x EV/sales is a bubble for this? The e-commerce part of it alone should trade at this valuation. And let’s not forget that the only reason GME has not sold more in Q3 is because there is a shortage of product! Demand is not gonna evaporate. So discount that valuation to this year sales and you have a <1.5x time Sales/EV valuation.


So ask yourself one question:

Would you pay an +80% interest to remain short in this thesis?

The current short volume is 68 million shares compared to the outstanding shares of 122 million shares. They have 4 days to cover. This was just stated yesterday and today it ran up 50%. I believe in a good Market tomorrow it is possible for SRNE to pop massively like AMC when they stated about their bankruptcy and solving almost all of it just to survive 2021.

"DELUGE of SPAM posts of stocks like Nokia and AMC, brokers ""coincidentally"" restricting GME trades, not suspicious at all???",43,l6h6y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6h6y0/deluge_of_spam_posts_of_stocks_like_nokia_and_amc/,20,1611817811.0,"I might not be able to read letters, but numbers are easy.

&#x200B;

Nokia and AMC are doing well! Congrats to the retards who got in early, but I would be wary. I'm not hating on the gains, but doesn't anyone find it odd how these two stocks traded over a BILLION in volume today? Sure, AMC's 900m debt relief might be a plus but I'll suck off my wife's step-boyfriend if that's the reason it shot up 300%+ today.

&#x200B;

And what's up with NOK?? They might have decent long term prospects, but there's literally no good reason for all this volume today. By \*pure\* chance, a good number of the bigger stock brokers all had some ""issues"" when it came to trading GME. \[TD claims that the problem was volume\]([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804)), but how could this be the case when GME only traded 90m volume today, not even a tenth of AMC?

&#x200B;

All of this happening while we have bots FLOODING this sub with low effort garbage about buying these stocks? What are they hoping to achieve? Are they trying to \[artificially link WSB to these stocks?\]([https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/)) Are they trying to deceive new subs to buy these stocks? Are they doing their own pump and dump to offset some of their losses? I don't know.

&#x200B;

\*What I do know\* is that I'm ALL IN on GME, and I don't plan to sell before next week. CNBC can try as hard as they want to spread misinformation, I can't hear them anyway from inside my 🚀. Every day we hold is another day the short interest burns. They're not getting shares from these 💎🙌.

Long time user that recently got back in the game.
I was wondering, would this attention and popularity not be a great opportunity to kick start some good in this world? GME is a great company but can we not support GME whilst also investing in a company that makes cheap insulin, or cost effective electric batteries, or advanced PVs etc.

I’m not going to suggest a ticker up here, I wouldn’t give the SEC and MMS the satisfaction. But I would love to here some suggestions for world helping companies we could invest in as a team below in the comments.

We already reset the status quo in terms of who decides if a company succeeds in the market, could we now reset who is seen as valuable?

Going to bed now, I look forward to reading suggestions in the morning over coffee.

I'm going to include a step by step here and include pictures below for the 90% of you who can't read. 

**Text Only**

Open Robinhood and click on the icon in the bottom right. Go to settings -> Account information and write down your account number for later. Make sure that the piece of paper you've written on is edible so you can destroy the evidence later. 

You'll have to open a Fidelity account which will take about 15 minutes and require some of your basic information. Once you're in Fidelity go the ""Transact"" tab on the bottom right and choose ""Transfer"". Then select ""Transfer assets from another financial institution and click ""continue"" on the pop-up. Click ""Start a transfer"" and log in with the log in you created when you created your account. Enter ""Robinhood securities llc"" into the search bar. Enter in the account number you wrote down earlier and choose ""Individual"" for the account type assuming you're an individual investor. Or select whatever type applies. Finally click ""Yes"" and ""Next"". 

**With Pictures**

Open up your RH account and click the icon in the bottom right.

I’m stupid as fuck and totally expect to be ripped apart and for y’all to run a train on my wife. But here goes.
The theory that this bubble is different from other bubbles comes from the idea that, instead of retail investors holding the bag yet again, the real bag holders are the short sellers. But will they be forced to cover?
Here’s why they might not have to:   

1) they have huge amounts of funds, including a trillion dollar lifeline from The Citadel. They can stay retarded and at a loss longer than you can stay exuberant.

2) short selling might not cause much of a squeeze. A short squeeze relies on there being more demand for stocks than supply. But GameStop is so heavily traded, that more than 100% of the float is traded every. Single. Day.

3) the smart money isn’t just in shorts. GameStop insiders own over a billion dollars worth of stock. Organizations are buying stock when their call options become ITM. There may be smart money going long the stock hoping to take a profit before y’all can.

4) Institutional investors can change the rules. They can cease trading completely on these stocks. Or, well meaning brokers can stop you from buying through their apps, which is already happening. They could arrest u/deepfuckingvalue to kill moral. They could kill this subreddit. All of these things would cause a panic and end the bubble.

5) for many of you this is your first time buying stocks. This isn’t smart money’s first rodeo. They are smarter and more emotionally and financially equipped for this situation.

Alright, I’m ready to be killed now.
I love you all and hope you take every fucking penny from the hedge funds and market manipulators. If there was ever a time for such a transfer of wealth, it’s deep in a pandemic in America.",2021-01-28 23:49:05

It is shocking to see how much the community can impact the lives around us in such a positive way, but it is hard to see that Robinhood has fucked us with the current gamma squeeze this friday. However, it is optimal for us to remember that next week is the week for this squeeze as mentions by u/wildthangy.

&#x200B;

So what is the plan? By no means is this financial advice or market manipulation, as said in the r/WALLSTREETBETS **RULES,** but to allow robinhood to take away our tendies and gains is absurd. REVIEW THEIR APP AND LET THEM KNOW IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK.

They are doing this so that people stop buying, so we stop contributing and adding to the massive tendy pile that has made the world as a whole wealthy, this will ultimately ruin all the progress we have made to get this far. 

So please i’m asking for all of us, even the ones who can’t bare to hold due to the fear built up inside. FUCK that fear. Hold on and strap on, they don’t want nobody new to join? Fine, find other ways to buy stock, webull, etoro, td ameritrade. Fuck there’s so many other options. Leave some of the gold in the bank on robinhood and begin investing on new platforms if you would like to see this continue, otherwise the stock is most likely going to lose its momentum due to the panic from people selling from being uninformed. 

HOLD THE LINE, IT’S THE ONLY WAY TO ETERNAL WEALTH! 

TLDR: simple caveman logic:
1-robin hood ban trades on popular stock.
2-no one sells.
3-stock no go down due to people not selling.
4-stock rebounds as hedge funds are forced to buy at high prices.
5-Stonks go up.

The 🌈 🐻 have shorted over 160 million shares of AMC as of YESTERDAY. They have doubled down on their shorts. Taking into account the free float of AMC is around 100 million shares, this means the current short interest is 160%!!!

This is ridiculous, they can drive thousands into bankruptcy while they make cash, however when they loose money, they stick together and show us the middle finger, call in the institutions so they can ""investigate"" 

This is complete proof that they are a bunch of wussies and that the institutions are illegitimate! 

It's easy to predict the market when they are pulling the strings, why could they not predict this?

Now they are not allowing us to trade because it is ""too risky"" while if they do it, its all fine and dandy. And the best part if they default on their debt, we will bail them out with ""quantitative easing"" with our taxes... 

Screw them all. 

It was supposed to be by the people for the people, and not by the billionaires for the billionaires. 

If anything this has brought excitement into stock trading and investing, this makes them scared as then how will they be able to explain the big commissions and taxes? All while the average person is kept in the dark.

**Long forward:** This is the only sub that consistently makes me laugh out loud, so my small way of paying you back is to help affirm that you are right and to stay the course. I am in as of yesterday (happy to provide proof) at around $370, because I believe this thing could make VW look like an asterisk. I will probably continue to add as Melvin (and others, always remember there are others) continue to financially and socially engineer their way off the event horizon of the giant blackhole they are spinning towards. By the way, what kind of moronic fund name is that? Hold the line just so that stupid fucking name no longer exists on a website. It sounds like the name of a hedge fund villain in a Nickelodeon tween drama.

Anyway, taking the long view, this is a culmination (or continuation) of decades of unregulated financial fuckery that continues to cause larger and larger glitches in the societal health matrix and goes unpunished as our politicians also profit in the background. Tell me how a sitting senator makes tens of millions on a salary of a couple hundred thousand. They are all part of the problem. I'm thrilled retail investors are able to be able to make money in this one and fire a shot across the bow of corrupted and entrenched interests that continue to divide our country further.

For people who jumped in without having any understanding of short selling or how bad a squeeze like this can really get (I would estimate 80-90% of you based on comments), take comfort in the fact that nobody on Wall Street does either. Or if they do, they don't care. An MBA is the least intelligence-requiring degree of any masters. Being a psychopath that doesn't care about who they step on has nothing to do with intelligence. This is 80-90% of hedge funds. They are all the same and there are a bunch of other ""professional"" fools in the same boat as Melvin on this playing the greater fool game right now. They just aren't as publicly visible. Otherwise this wouldn't be +100% shorted. Melvin can't do it alone.

Before we get into it, there is no expiration on shorts, as has been reiterated over and over again. This is 100% fact, so say it three times so it sticks in your head. Options have expiration dates, shorts do not. Say that three times. This fact gets at the possible timing of everything, so it's really important to not be moved off this, no matter who is saying it.

**Understanding the GME Short Situation**

Imagine an overcrowded movie theater where it's standing room only for the long awaited premier of Spaceballs 2. Somehow a lot of people have snuck past the heavy security and are sitting on the floor everywhere, violating the fire marshall code. The theater ownership probably shouldn't have sold all these extra tickets, but who cares? What's the worst thing that could happen? They paid off the fire marshall years ago anyway.

In ironic twist of fate, all the people in the theater also happen to be a client of the notorious loan shark, Fat Gamestop. They all like to use their borrowed money to play roulette in Vegas, which means that no normal loan source will touch them. Fat Gamestop is happy to charge them 20% weekly interest on the massive loans they took out before a bender weekend. Everyone in the theater went to Vegas, got drunk, and decided to team bet it all on the number 7. They lost and came home penniless.

Now Fat Gamestop doesn't give a shit. That part is great. Since now these people owe him their lives. He wants his interest payments though. Since they don't have any money at all, Fat Melvin is getting impatient. A few broken legs don't seem to have gotten the message through. So he's getting more drastic.

As the movie starts, a few people get up and try and go to the bathroom. Surprisingly the doors back into the theater seem to be locked. Frustrated, but not concerned, they return to their seats. A few more minutes go by and people start to smell smoke. Is someone smoking in the theater? In 2021? What an asshole. Except the smell gets stronger, that's not someone smoking, that smells like fire. Some people get up now and start walking around. The inside doors are still locked and smoke is now pouring into the screening room from the project room, which also appears to have a small fire in it.

Now more and more people are starting to stand up and look around. Murmuring over the sound of the movie. A few smart people start to move towards the single exterior exit. Many more start pushing on the interior doors which are solidly locked and don't budge. The fire in the projector room is now blazing and flames are starting to lick around the corners into the cinema. 

People are really starting to panic now, everyone is up and rushing to the front of the theater towards the one exit door. The people who got there first have already realized the horrible truth, that door is also locked. Instead of ""Exit,"" the sign on the door now says, ""Pay Me - Fat Gamestop""

Everyone is now trampling each other to get away from the raging inferno inside the cinema. People are succumbing to smoke inhalation and getting crushed underfoot in the stampede to the locked door. Eventually the door gives way under the weight of humanity pressing on it and a few lucky souls spill out into the bright sunshine, alive, but not unharmed. Most of the theater ironically looks like a movie scene, with bodies everywhere.

A solemn CNBC reporter standing outside intones, ""early investigation by the fire marshall indicates the cleaning lady was at fault for the 150 deaths earlier today. Strict regulations will be put in place, restricting their access to supervised by a theater manager.""

You guest it, this is about GME

I normally just watch what’s going on and don’t post anything but now I feel the need of saying what’s on my mind. 
I am in this group for about 18 months now, and I just love how informative, fun, direct and rude yet supportive this community is. Never have I ever read anything political or discriminatory in here. Sure the tone sometimes gets rough, but that is just what we are, a bunch of retards...

This morning they nearly had me, I nearly proved my 🧻🤲, I somehow was expecting more of the morning marked and I considered selling, because I thought that was is... but then I could not believe the shit they spun together in the media about this being an alt right group... WTF!!!
All the shit they came up with the last couple of days, but that was it for me. Call me naive, but I never thought it’s like on tv, where the hedgefundpeople have so much sway of the media... 

For me it was perfect timing, the 💎🤲 are now back, and with a different agenda then just making money. Let’s burn a hole in their pockets, let’s take there money, let’s show history that the shit they pull can not stand and the system they build is not just for there gains and winnings! 
GME is the way they gave us to do just that. 
I do think there will be time to buy everything else back, once this is done and that is why I will give it all I have got left!!!

They reposition, get to safety, and leave the general public holding the bag. What we are seeing is orchestrated manipulation by the same firms who time and time again suck value from the system and leave everyone else standing naked. This must stop. HOLD STRONG. 💎💎💎💎💎💎",2021-01-28 23:45:44

I am fairly new to stocks and only do long term trading so I may be wrong when it comes to this but I have a question. 


We saw that the company that bet on gamestop losing got sniffed out and in my opinion got their just desserts while the little people who invested won which is awesome. How do we avoid another company seeing this and try to manipulate this sub to do something similar but instead that company will  gain while we lose? 

I believe this is plausible because Wallstreet has done this before (remember 2008) and I believe they will do it again. I know there are plenty of smart people on here who will see that kinda shit but what keeps the other side from flooding this sub from bots suffocating good advice?

Now, with this whole $GME thing, you've gotten more than a smile out of me. People always wrote this sub off as ""just another obscure reddit group"" or something else putting it down. Well, you've shown how ""just another obscure reddit group"" can go out there and take on the people who have taken so much from ordinary people.

Company culture starts at the top. SAC, where Melvin Capital's CEO worked, and who invested part of $2.75 billion to bail out Melvin, probably ACTIVELY hired such Wall Street Psychopaths and probably viewed this kind of aggression as a positive. Mr. Plotkin himself got away with a thing or two:

This is our moment to show these bastards that we will not waver, we have 💎 FUCKING 🙌. This overt manipulation and resistance to the little guy making some money disgusts me. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK

I’m not gonna lie, I joined this thread about a week ago as things were first looking saucy. At first I figured I’d make some quick money by riding the volatility. I sold 2 shares yesterday, and that will haunt me for the rest of my life. I thought, “hey, I’m a small player with only a few shares and a fuck load of debt, I should lock in a profit and hold what I have left.” 

WE LIKE THE STOCK

A man can only admit when he has done wrong and seek forgiveness. So I bought another share yesterday when I realized this is more than just a moment, its a movement. I want to BUY THE DIPS but RH has apparently decided that I’m too stupid to understand volatility and that they are somehow protecting me from buying stock I like.

GME reaches 2000$/share, or 42069$/shares. And then what? Most of you will have made a killing. Some of you will be millionaires. But you are going to be millionaires on the screen.  


Once Melvin is dead, the shorts will have to sell their shorts to have bread in the evening and all options are ITM, then what? The trade is crowded and nobody is (short) selling. And suddenly nobody is buying. And then contrarian liquidity will cease to exist. And huge disruptions with order flows are likely to happen. We saw that to a non-negligible degree yesterday, we are seeing it today. And it's going to get worse.   


GME is going to be worth gazillions on paper but you probably won't be able to sell until the price is much much lower. The liquidity cost most of you are going to incur is something you can't imagine right now and that the stock price on the monitor is and will be hiding. Some of you will have made the kind of fuck you money that allows you to live carefreely. Many of you will be left holding the bag.

* Why would these brokers decide to do things that they know will piss off a significant portion of their users to the point of boycotts, lawsuits and coordinated bad reviews?
* Why would the Financial Times and NBCN risk their reputation on spreading false information on WSB, Reddit and hedgefund positions?
* Why would anyone care enough about a subreddit that they will create bots to fellow-kid-spam any other stock just to cause division?

The answer is very obviously economic interests. The people and organizations behind are the ones who stand to lose from this. Their resistance shows that we're doing fine. Their worry should make us smell blood.

First of all, I am blown away with what this sub has achieved. Congrats to all of you. Hold the line and wait.. wait.. until they feel the pain.. until they start to bleed.. and then we sell! 

I was watching CNBC and Andrew Sorkin said that one reason the short is 140% is that the same share is shorted multiple times. Very simply, A owns the original share, B shorts it by borrowing from A and sells it to C, D shorts  it by borrowing from C and so on. Can someone explain if that is possible? Doesn't that mean that, in theory, the short percentage can be multiple times the float? Almost seems there should be rules to prevent this. 

By the way, I am watching CNBC and it took them a long time to ask this basic question. They will talk down on the little guys as mania, dumb money etc, but spend little time talking about how such a high short percent is even possible. Their audiences are really the wall street and not the average Joe investor looking for more information.

Robinhood will suspend orders for calls and outright longs.

The potential losses from demanding $5K a share are something like 400 billion which would require fed intervention.

Yes its entirely possible the ponzi financial system collapses if GME keeps printing higher. Remember subprime collapsed wallstreet in 2008 but that was a tiny % of actual lending.

No way will regulators allow this so expect freezes on buying followed by major lawsuits against the financial establishment.

Edit:

$5K GME makes posters on this subreddit some of the richest people on the planet.

Please bear with me, it is hard for me to put my thoughts and especially feelings into words. I see bonding and common struggle with open arms towards Boomers, Millennials, Left Leaning, Right Leaning, Race, Creed, Ethnicity. My world view has been shattered over the last few years. I am not an idiot, and while not quite a Boomer, I have been around the sun more than a few times. I always kept my head down, worked hard, tried to make a good living for myself and my family. In my business I always tried to do right by my employees and my customers. I am a capitalists', as in the idea of fair trade between free people. It's also why I am Libertarian, the less government involved in my life, the better in my opinion. I mention my Capitalism and Political beliefs because that is what has become blaringly obvious to the masses, the Elites of money & power are no longer even trying to pretend it's about making our lives easier. Sitting here reading your family stories about the '08 meltdown disasters has brought back so many emotions, as I remember losing my house, my wife and just trying to stay afloat because my young son needed me. So sitting here watching a movement, even if it does nothing more than wake the elites up and remind them that real power is the people, means more to me than any of you could possibly know, so THANK YOU for this! BTW that same son who I mentioned earlier, he texted me yesterday to tell me about this movement and that BB and NOK were next. I immediately bought both, not for the money, but to be part of something larger than myself and to support an ideal that transcends the petty BS of polarization of class and beliefs that the Elites have always used to distract and move us humans as if we are just cattle to be herded to the slaughter. However it turns out, I will hold my end of this. Thank you for listening to an old man rant and may all of you be blessed with love and happiness.
