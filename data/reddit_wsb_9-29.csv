$CBAT $SUNW $SPI $OXBR Y'all are missing the point.,4,j1fmmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1fmmo/cbat_sunw_spi_oxbr_yall_are_missing_the_point/,11,1601340416.0,"$CBAT is going to be a great play further yet:

Their new tabless batteries hold further implications than just for EV companies like tsla, the Chinese government have been looking for alternative sources of energy storage, and will refuse to use foreign businesses for the case of infrastructure development.

CBAT's already existing patents have their primary implications in the EV/ES sector, but the tabless battery announcement mainly points to  grid-integrated energy storage as an immediately profitable direction for the company.
