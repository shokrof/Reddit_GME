This is your chance to do your job and make your children proud for once.

How, do you ask?

Yes! You could be the one to write a Pulitzer-prize winning report by uncovering the biggest financial debacle of the decade.

If any such person is reading this comment, start here and choose to be on the right side of history for once.

Anyone who is social-media friendly can send this post to journalists via Twitter etc. Publications that may look into this might be the *Guardian* in UK or perhaps *CBC News* in Canada. Don Pittis is a dork but pretends to report the truth and I could see him taking a look if challenged.

Or maybe someone can get [Michael Lewis](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Michael-Lewis/4349) on the scene? Now there's a Big Swinging Dick who knows how to play the game. 

I bet others on here can think of even better avenues to break this story. It needs to be broke.

I tried to buy some penny stocks today on E-Trade and for 5$ worth of stocks they wanted to charge me a 5$ commission. This seems new to me as I've been using them for several months and they've never charged such a high commission. Is anyone experiencing this with E-Trade and other platforms today that were previously commission free? Is this their response to the volatility?

Does this seem sound to you retards? Stop munching on the crayons for a bit and think about it. You are talking about pumping it to 10-50-100-420, and not by any short squeeze, but by sheer pump of money. A situation far beyond what is happening with the other green stocks like TLRY, OGI or APHA. 

Anyone heard about the pump and dump before? About bag holders? Anyone?


Edit: For anyone that still is on the fence about this. Don't let yourselves be taken advantage of. The normal increase for weed stocks up until now after hours has been 5-15%, SNDL has 101% as I am writing this: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/sndl

Am i slightly retarded? Yes.

Is the energy sector massively overlooked at the moment? Indeed

The following Quote is taken directly from the website: https://www.powerhouseenergy.net

""**PHE uses Waste to Energy expertise to help customers destruct and recover energy from their challenging waste streams**.""

Useless, cheap and unrecycable plastic-waste can finally be turned into a monetized product, which also solves one of the greater challenges of mankind - dealing with waste streams

""**DMG¬Æ Technology developed and owned by PHE delivers value for customers through producing electricity and hydrogen as well as other chemical precursors.**""

The end product can vary from Heat, Electricity and Synthetic Gas - one which is Hydrogen.

A key differentiator is that DMG can produce clean energy from ***ALL*** difficult plastics

The DMG technology is future proof and demand will increase eventually. Why? The process generates source of high purity hydrogen for vehicle fuell cells PSV & HGV

The engineering behind the DMG technology is party patented and partly kept confidential, so that they can protect themselves.

So how does PowerHouse Energy plan on generating consistent revenue?

* Well it sounds promising: Revenues will be generated from licenses and engineering support of its DMG waste to hydrogen and power product
* Strong commercial partner in Peel NRE Environmental developing first facility and UK business plan of over 77 facilities
* The first application of the DMG technology is in development at Peel's Protos energy park in Ellesmere Port
* The Plastic Park is planned to handle around 300,000 tpa of plastic
* A target of at least 30 DMG sites around the UK will be achieved. Under the terms of the agreement with Peel, 30 operational sites would generate ¬£15.0m **JUST** in annual licence fees.
* Subsequent to Protos the Powerhouse business strategy has limited risk exposure and low capital overhead.

And we are talking just about potential Sites in England, while demand in plastic waste solution is increasing globally

Can this easily get to 0.5‚Ç¨ - 1‚Ç¨ in the next few weeks to months? Yes!

Ill definitely hold for long. I see alot of potential

A guide to how I day trade,297,lhcrcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhcrcu/a_guide_to_how_i_day_trade/,196,1613046169.0,"1. I Don‚Äôt go all in on trades, I keep some $ aside to dollar cost average if a trade goes against me.

2. I try to average 2-4% gains per trade, if it goes down 2-4% i can either take a loss and move on or if there‚Äôs no bad news and I‚Äôm confident it should go back up, I dollar cost average to lower my entry price.

3. I manage my emotions no matter what way the stock heads, if im panicking when it goes down im more inclined to make a bad decision, if a stock goes up, I don‚Äôt pat myself on the back thinking this is easy and get used to winning.

4. Sometimes there will be bad news and the stock might open 10% lower. If this news is not potentially going to end the company, I need to dictate more time to holding my position. Generally stocks tend to go up overtime.

5. I AVOID MEME STOCKS. By the time it became a meme the party‚Äôs already over, I also avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) if a stock has risen too much too quickly, people will sure be taking profit.

6. The more money i have on the table the more the gains and losses, if im making 2-4% profit per day trading day (roughly 253 days) that‚Äôs roughly 500-1000% gains in a year. If im compounding my gains the % gains in a year are a lot higher.

As for stock picking, I usually look at a lot of different charts on the stocks on my watch list and make decisions based on the recent news and trends, If the stock goes down a bit I look at the risk vs reward, if stocks are going down 4-5% + without bad news there‚Äôs a higher chance of the reward being higher than the risk.

If the SNP500, Nasdaq, dow and SPY have had a lot of green days I expect a quick pull back which is when I make trades on volatility, I jump in and out of UVXY when this happens.

I also look at the volume and which direction that volume went with the price.

There‚Äôs a rule called pattern day trading, if im trading with below $25k in cash balance and stocks, i can only make 3 day trades in a 5 day trading period otherwise a 90 day trading ban, this applies to margin accounts, cash accounts incur a T+2 settlement waiting period. 
 
I‚Äôve been using this method and it‚Äôs working out really well for me so far. 

Feel free to list your own methods that works for you :)

Edit: edited so I‚Äôm not giving financial advice, this is just my method, again, feel free to list your own.",2021-02-11 14:22:49

And now imagine that instead of alcohol it's a substance with no calories, no hangover, no increase in blood pressure, and it just mellows you out during a time when the whole world is on edge. 

--

* Several Dems (Cory Booker just this week) have said they're voting on weed by the end of the year. 91% of America supports legalization. Once weed is legalized the banks in the US open up to companies, the connections in place get set into action, and the market explodes. 

* CGC just delivered another quarter of record revenue, and they project profitability in 2022. They are building a track record winning in core markets, while also accelerating their US growth strategy. Their CEO, David Klein, was a top executive at Constellation Brands, one of the biggest alcohol distributors in the entire world. You want a huge cooperation to distribute drinks, write commercials, social media ad blitzes, SuperbOwl commerials, and then people are hooked. Constellation Brands is just that. CGC has also the advantage of a portfolio of compelling brands like Martha Stewart CBD, BioSteel, This Works, and Storz & Bickel. 

* The company has been spending large resources in developing the right brands and distribution in the U.S. Another key has been purchase of 70% of the equity in Acreage Holdings (ACRGF). The company has an end-to-end platform in 15 states, covering cultivation, processing, dispensing and branding.

Weed drinks will be one of the biggest profit centers. That's where a lot of the money. Consumers with money won't smoke or eat weed. EDIT: Yes eating is the same as drinking (my bad); but consumers are foolish and many will want to consume weed like beer / wine. Smoking certainly isn't for everyone.

EDIT: For the record I think Tilray and Aphria are awesome plays too. I just don't have the balls to play such high flying stocks, but that's probably just my weakness. Tendies for all! Imagine when NYC legalizes. We'll all be winners.

* Cohen mentioned he wants to **disrupt industries**
* Cohen has done it before with this **ULTIMATE** Destination idea with Chewy **-** calling it the **1 stop solution** \- Chewy rapidly expanded product offering to include all pet food and supplies so there was never a reason to shop elsewhere. By 2018, 90% of our revenue was from repeat customers. Cohen is planning to do the same in Gamestock (and how did Cohen achieve (90% repeat customers? cont. reading)
* Cohen left Chewy because - I‚Äôm a **business builder,** not a manager. My work was complete. But I was **no longer in FULL CONTROL.** And I **DIDN'T want a BOSS. (meaning he wont be passive in GME board, if the letter to the board didn't make the point clear enough)**

**Formula for creating Fans**(90% returning), not customers:

* **net promoter score** (NPS), a common measure of customer satisfaction, Chewy always 87 and above at Chewy. lemonade is at 70 . Netflix 68, Amazon 62, and Apple 68.
* New Hire - **Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care** ‚Äì Ms. Durkin, who previously served as **Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service**, has a start date at GME of **March 1, 2021.**
* \- **handwritten holiday cards**
* \- Our customers would send us photos of their pets all the time. We **hired artists** to turn those photos into personalized portraits of their pets, which we sent to our customers. These are **high-quality drawings**, something you‚Äôd want to hang in your bedroom. Today, **thousands of those portraits get shipped out every month**.
* **- flowers** when their animals pass away.
* \- A **24-hour** customer service line promises to answer any call within **six seconds.**
* \- And, yes, the **customer is always right.**
* \- If they needed something **faster than we could ship it, like that day**, we told them to go to a local store and buy it and we‚Äôd **reimburse them**
* **- fairly common** to see calls with customers go on for **4 hours**. That was a good thing because we knew that **meant someone was happy**. **Who can argue for four hours?**
* This created Fans, just like Apple/Tesla - **Fans tell all their friends and family** \- When people shop at Chewy, they really understand **we care about them**, we care about their pets, and they want to tell all their friends and family."" "" i don't know too many businesses that ended up not being successful when they did a really good job at delighting their customers.""

**Hiring**

* Will **hire the best people** and **delegate** into their areas of expertise. (proven by recent hires)
* We **hired for passion**. Many people quit stable jobs and relocated with their families from across the country to join us. It was a tremendous sacrifice that we never took lightly. (only 2% write back in linkedin)
* New Hire - **Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment** ‚Äì Mr. Krueger, who previously held senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC, has a start date of March 1, 2021. In his new role, Mr. Krueger will oversee the management of **e-commerce fulfillment centers.**
* New Hire - **Matt Francis** to the newly-created role of **Chief Technology Officer**. Mr. Francis has a start date of **February 15, 2021. Engineering Leader at Amazon Web Services.** responsible for overseeing e-commerce and technology functions.

**Mindset**

* P**rioritized long term growth** over short term profitability (just like tsla, amzn, turning GME into a growth stock, so a ps ratio of 1 is just crazy cheap now)
* A**ims for Hypergrowth**
* M**ove fast** \- In just 3 months we built a website, found a distributor and partnered with a third-party logistics company when starting Chewy. Expect to see the same in GME.
* **Workaholic** \- lead by example and expect my team to work hard too
* **Fast** \- **build Chewy first fulfillment center in 6 months rather than 18 months (as estimated by an Consultants initially)**
* Great character - **Respect co workers** \- And I couldn‚Äôt expect them to treat each other with respect if I was being a **dictator.** **humble**
* **Confidence to be misunderstood,** to able to **believe in his vision** and see pass competing head-on with Amazon and the pets.com failure during the dot com bubble
* Aims to **underpromising and overdelivering on sales**
* **Simple formula** for success in Chewy that can be duplicated in GME 1. amazing customer service 2. low prices 3. fast shipping 4. selection
* **Dares to dream - aims to be industry leader** \- last thing you want to be is a subscale e-commerce company. You‚Äôre a dead man walking, and Amazon will crush you.
* **not afraid to go against** the the board/traditional rules - building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.3%'s budget. hiring expensive executives even though we weren‚Äôt profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member. (proof that he will make GME team do what he says/take over as CEO)
* Transformation of GME started - By the end of the latest fiscal year, GameStop will have closed more than 1,000 stores since mid-2019
* Adding PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables and gaming TVs to its store.
* I learned the value of **hard work** and being a **jack of all trades**, and that you should **never be afraid to do things yourself.**

**Others:**

* **Ability to raise money** \- raised **6 rounds of financing** totaling more than **$350 million** from **T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Greenspring, Lone Pine, Verlinvest, and the investment bank Allen & Company for Chewy**
* Vertically integrated e-commerce requires **flawless execution** across many fronts ‚Äî marketing, supply chain, merchandising, and everything in between
* **will protect shareholders** \- Those investors put their trust in me and my vision,‚Äù Cohen writes, ‚Äúand I repaid them with returns.‚Äù
* **never afraid to say no.** I was constantly bombarded with new ideas, and when you‚Äôre growing quickly it‚Äôs critical to stay focused, so I said no to almost everything. There‚Äôs a time and place for ideation, but in the early days when resources are finite, it‚Äôs important to choose a handful of things and do them extremely well. (just like Steve Jobs)
* **can handle a big business** \- scaled from 3 employees in 2011 to over 9000 Chewtopians by 2018.

REMEMBER!!! Cohen aim to Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the ULTIMATE Destination for Gamers. ULTIMATE. I for one wants GME to go into manufacturing and make a Macbook quality Gaming laptop. Its about time this thing gets made)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

update 1:  alot of ppl are asking what the price target is. So im going to give it a shot, but since im such a newbie, pls advise if im calculating this wrong.

P/S Ratio     =    current share price        /      \[1 year revenue/ shares outstanding\]     

**currently**

0.626           =              $49.64                     /             79.3      

**2 years down the road, maybe**

20                =               **$1585.94**                /             79.3 

&#x200B;

# $1585.94 ... ~32x in return

&#x200B;

**Assumptions:**

PS ratio of 20 - im comparing with the companies below, which can be very controversial because i heard we are not suppose to compare PS ratio between vastly different companies, but im doing it anyway. And of course, GME is being priced as a growth stock at this PS ratio level.

TSLA = 27      ROKU = 38     BYND = 26    LMND = 78     SQ = 16

&#x200B;

1 year revenue - stays the same. Which I don't believe it to be true since there will be additional revenue from adding PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables and gaming TVs to its store + boosted online revenue (Cohen is very focus on). Which also means my price target of $1585.94 is too low.

  
Shares outstanding - stays the same. (which likely will increase but it shouldn't be too much since Cohen explicitly mentioned ""Maximizing Stockholder Value"" + his track record of Chewy

As a holder of GME shares (and also AMC, BB, and NOK shares) reading this article gave me a lot of hope. In the past two weeks, we've been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We've even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.

For those who don't want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from r/WSB are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.

Please read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we're a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen's leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we're diamond hand apes! 

Also to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they're tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We're not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I'm down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won't have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn't raise no quitter!

[GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis. A comparison with AMC + Others,441,lh99ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh99ir/gme_volume_vs_price_linear_regression_analysis_a/,184,1613034896.0,"Hey everyone,

I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it. 

In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:

* AMC
* ATVI
* GM
* GME
* JPM
* SNDL
* SNOW
* TSLA
* UPS
* V


The criteria was just ""fairly popular stocks"", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.


I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.


What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a ""sign"" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. 
 Here's a general definition of R^2 : 
>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.

Here are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):

* AMC: 0.6766
* ATVI: 0.579
* GM: 0.0012
* GME: 0.907
* JPM: 0.6203
* SNDL: 0.3488
* SNOW: 0.0948
* TSLA: 0.7087
* UPS: 0.6852
* V: 0.39


I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current ""reasoning"" for holding is that there's a lot of ""weird"" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as ""maybe it's this, maybe it's that"". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).

PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.

Apparently Cindicator Capital is run by ~~Hybrid~~ Inbred Intelligence, but they just aren't quite smart enough to understand the collective wisdom of r/wallstreatbets that I can boil down to just three letters:  GME.

To solve this, they want to hire a true autist (more than 1 year at Wallstreetbets and at least 1,000 karma--none from prayer threads) to guide them down wisdoms' paths specifically to play FD's (someone tell their HR department what that stands for...).

# They are paying $200k base + 30% of profits.

To help these morons out, I'm posting the job listing in full here, since that would have been the hybrid intelligent move in the first place.   I think we should all apply with a top line comment, and then make fun of the applicants in the thread.

Also, /u/dhsmatt2 :  your job sucks.   Apply for this one.

I can do better than that:  Stonks only go up.   That is more accurate than 70% since 2019)***. Now we‚Äôre looking for someone to strengthen our trading team and help us build new products.¬†

**About this role**¬†

As a Sentiment Trader, you‚Äôll be the voice of the millions of traders.

**What you should have:**¬†

* An active member of r/wallstreetbets with an account age of >365 days and karma of over 1000; **(no prayer threads.   They don't need to take your energy.   They just want FD's.)**
* Clear, unbiased thinking that defies authority;  **(Don't worry about the first part.   Defying authority.   Check.)**
* A refined taste for memes and a sense of humour.  **(The fellow kids meme was made for this one)**

A Strong Case for the TLRY Shorts - Don't be left Holding a Bag,634,lhb2z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhb2z5/a_strong_case_for_the_tlry_shorts_dont_be_left/,379,1613040517.0,"TLDR: Are you really going to tell me that a merged Tilray and Aphria warrants Tilray trading at 4x Google‚Äôs revenue multiple and 2x Tesla‚Äôs multiple when they don‚Äôt even have positive cash flows?

OrganiGram: 21.7x

Aurora: 18.6x

HEXO: 16x

**EDIT 2:** My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Listen up y‚Äôall. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‚Äòround. Remember, true diamond hands don‚Äôt care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let‚Äôs learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today‚Ä¶and the day before‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I‚Äôm proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I‚Äôm here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I‚Äôm not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I‚Äôm going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I‚Äôm going to use only numbers directly from TLRY‚Äôs merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let‚Äôs start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company ‚Äì nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria‚Äôs stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation‚Ä¶we add the merged company‚Äôs debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) ‚Äì and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, ‚ÄúWhy do multiples matter?‚Äù. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to‚Ä¶..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That‚Äôs saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzvunu13trg61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=0534676fa415203dce905ff045d66bb79e37695d

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don‚Äôt get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the potential‚Äù. Potential isn‚Äôt realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren‚Äôt even US focused. Seriously ‚Äì read their securities filings.

Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads.",2021-02-11 12:48:37
Being on the other side of the weed stock rally,75,lhb2m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhb2m1/being_on_the_other_side_of_the_weed_stock_rally/,163,1613040486.0,"
So weed stocks have been pumping this week. The only catalyst I've found for that is Virginia passing a bill that will legalize it by 2024( https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/virginia-lawmakers-pass-marijuana-legalization-bills-75716927 )

TLRY, APHA, ACB, SNDL, are some of the stocks being bought. My question, is why are people investing in Canadian based weed growers/distributors on potential for it to be federally legal in the United States? Why would it be profitable for the US to import all of its weed in the case that it does become legal on a federal level? Don't international trade tariffs and everything else that goes iwth importing foreign goods make it less than ideal, when compared to growing it domestically? Sure, there is some % that is legal imported for medical use, and research pruposes (TLRY and CGC) but how much is really being imported today, and will it stay like that if its federally legalized in the US. It's not like its that hard to grow it here either - most of the US has a climate for it, and if it doesn't you can build greenhouses. Am I missing something here?

The problem is, there don't seem to be any US based, publicly traded weed growers/distributors. So people just flocked to the Canadian ones. I don't get it.",2021-02-11 12:48:06

Good news there is still a great sleeper play out there . This has been discussed in r/stocks and here in WSB weeks and it‚Äôs simple merger math. 

Buy APHA not TLRY.  Why? Because APHA will convert to TLRY shares for a profit at a .838 to one. In other words 100 shares of APHA will convert to 83.8 TLRY shares.  One TLRY share at close was $63.80  and one APHA only $26.34.

83% of $63.80 is $53.46.

APHA is trading at a $28 per share discount! 

APHA is a great company and actually the one buying TLRY (Reverse merger) the two are poised to do very well with legalization and the tickers will switch in the 2Q of This year.

#What you can do to keep this place great

* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.

* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.

* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!

* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.

* Don't ask ""what the next move is"" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't ""pump and dump"" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.

#What we're doing to keep this place great

* The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.

* In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.

* We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

* We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.

#Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!

Over the past week, there were multiple *really good* DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.

But you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. 

Don't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.

#A note on the moderation team:

The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.

This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.

"NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?",99,lhab8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhab8w/ntdoy_is_the_most_undervalued_company_how_do_you/,114,1613038127.0,"Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:

1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...

2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...

3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?

4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...

5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.

6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.

7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.

8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE üòÆ

I picked up more shares at $12.00 during the after-hours dip.

&#x200B;

# Numbers

* Earnings **(that's right, this company makes money. what a concept üòÇ)**  
for fiscal year 2020 were $1.801 billion compared to $1.409 billion for the year before.  
Have you ever seen a boomer telecom company grow **earnings** by 27.8% YoY, despite a minor dip in top line revenue?  I don't think so.  Leadership over at üí°**$LUMN**üí° has one thing on their mind: ü§ë  

* Since the original DD post, a fellow ape ü¶ç told me that learning üöÄmultiplicationüöÄ would help me with my financial analyses. So I'll try that here.  
At an after-hours price per share of $11.96 with 1,085,666,000 shares outstanding, that puts the **P/E ratio** for the past fiscal year at **7.22**.    **BURRY** wasn't joking when he sniffed out the value here.  

* You might look at the report and see ""-$2.12"" EPS, but this is due to an accounting trick to write off the boomer parts of the business that they're divesting of.  Do the math yourself, retard.

&#x200B;

# Congratulations to everyone who has followed me, and by proxy BURRY.

We may see a dip in the next few days because the market hates companies that make money, but don't fear. I'll personally be picking up more calls tomorrow if we continue to dip.

1. Why would you ever put money into a HEXO that‚Äôs up over 100% in the last month that just went through a 4/1 reverse split to be eligible to be put on the NYSE???

Well let me answer that question for you children. HEXO OWNS THE #1 POSITION IN WEED DRINKS IN CANADA! They own 42.5% of Truss, A company that is targeting the 71% of Canadian pussies who get turned off of weed because they have to smoke it. I‚Äôve never met someone who hates being high (under the correct circumstances) but I know a lot of people who hate it smoke. What if they can üçπ it?? Do you understand the potential, currently weed beverages are currently 1.9% of the Canadian market (1.4 US), experts agree that weed bev‚Äôs can grow to 15% weeds total sales

2. But let‚Äôs talk about how much money are they are losing... because they did lose $170m million in the Q2. They only lost 4.2m in Q3üöÄüöÄ. Not to mention CGC, currently having one of the largest market cap evaluations at 20B market cap only posted 440M net rev, compared to HEXO‚Äôs 41M with only a 1.24B market cap. Now let‚Äôs get to what everyone wants to here about. Are they really growing though? 

3. TLDR on weed stance 

Heavily invested in Quebec, Greece, and Colorado. They aren‚Äôt branding any further currently (waiting for American legalization imo). They produce way more bud then they can sell but because the price of a gram has fallen from 5.29 last year to under $3 now they have been able to ram up sales and cut their net losses to only 4milly last q. They are still producing 50% more weed than they can sell ready for a wave of legalization to expand their cannibals reach.

Main highlights highlights. Up 114% in gross revenue from the comparative prior year. Net revenue is up 103%. Expanding reach into Alberta(18% total sales), Ontario(15%), and British Columbia(6%). They have the #1 market share in Quebec. Each province having a strong tourist presence. They currently have 150m in straight cash.

The SEC has previously warned that short sellers can hide their shorts through some trickery with the help of market makers. Well we have data reported by FINRA showing how much naked short selling was done by market makers through the end of January too, there was an explosion of 4.6 million shares of Short Exempt Volume by market makers, which could have been used to help short sellers hide their positions. (FINRA notes they don‚Äôt capture all data, and their total trading volume seems to be a little less than half that shown on Yahoo Finance. Thus presumably to account for the full trading volume of activity we need to more than double the sample FINRA publishes. In other words **10.2 million shares could have been hidden by market makers given the high Short Exempt Volume through the end of January**.)

\--

[Link](https://postimg.cc/47jdfqtF) of the data pulled from FINRA, notice the jump in Short Exempt Volume highlighted in yellow starting January 13th, showing market makers selling naked shorts. Notice how the Short Exempt Volume has only grown as we moved into February, even though overall trading volume has trended down. This indicated to me that the market makers might be playing a larger role in hiding even more shorts in February potentially.

Combining the official short shares and the potentially hidden short shares, we get to 31.6 million shares, representing 67% of float at the end of January.

\--

FINRA data shows short sales represented more than half of FINRA trading volume throughout February, leading to the conclusion shorts have been increasing their stake against the company again opportunistically at higher prices this month. Some of the shorting likely was done by high frequency algos that typically close their position by day end, but the short volumes were so high it would be impossible to close all the shorts out given the limited volume. If there were no other buyers, and only short sellers opening and closing their positions throughout February, conservatively there would be a net 11.8 million new shorts that went unclose based on FINRA data, and if that is inflated to account for the trading volume FINRA is not capturing, then there may have been a total of **29.1 million new shares shorted in February**.

\--

Bringing it all together.

21.4 million short shares officially reported by FINRA for end of January.

\+10.2 million shares potentially hidden by market makers through Short Exempt Volume in January.

\+29.1 million new shares shorted through February 9th.

**60.7 million shares short in total through February 9th by my estimates, representing 129% of float presently.**

\--

The table below shows a rough estimate of the cumulative portion of shorts that would be underwater with losses at each price point. This was roughly estimated using the price ranges and short volumes by trading day. A**t a $50 share price around 40% of the shorts are underwater by my estimates, and at a $100 share price around 75% would be underwater, and by a price of $150 more than 80% of shorts would be underwater.** In other words, going above those price points would put pressure on an increasingly larger portion of the shorts to close out their positions.

$450 = 98%

$400 = 96%

$350 = 94%

$300 = 92%

$250 = 88%

$200 = 84%

$150 = 81%

$100 = 74%

$50 = 42%

\--

This analysis can be improved upon with more detailed trading volume data by the minute, but this was based on day end volumes and price ranges. It also assumes the official short shares reports by FINRA at the end of January only represent about a third of all the shorts that actually exist today. Despite being very rough estimates, these are intended to illustrate the prices that may potentially be key pain point prices for short sellers.

\--

**TLDR - shorts are hiding their shorts position which the SEC is aware of. A lot of short exempt volume in the last couple of weeks. Short interest is most likely at 129% vs 78%. üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Pick operationally profitable companies.

There‚Äôs a saying in martial arts: If you can‚Äôt do it slow, you can‚Äôt do it fast. So pick a weed grower that can grow and sell their product for a profit. This should be the backbone of any op. Income from stakes in other businesses or changes in valuation of inventory are some tricks used to cook the books.

Remember: the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last December, only for that legislation to die in the Senate, still controlled by the GOP. Now that Dems have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization.

As a resident of the UK I feel there is going to be a big media and public push for rapid legalisation soon as it is a full no-brainier and I know nobody who is vehemently against it.

They have clearly started to look at this in Westminster and given the Tories progressive agenda coupled with a need for new industries to grow I think that looking at companies with Uk access is a great start.

#Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

#News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

&nbsp;
When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

&nbsp;
Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

&nbsp;
 As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

&nbsp;
The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

&nbsp;
By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

The main appeal for investing in BB involves the electric vehicle industry since BB is developing a QNX software that will run autonomous vehicles.  Blackberry‚Äôs QNX platform is designed to protect data communication within the vehicle and the ‚Äúproduct makes the countless nodes of data communication in embedded systems functionally safe.‚Äù

Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has partnered with BB to use the QNX software in their vehicles. If Blackberry plays its cards right, the QNX software could be used in a multitude of different things. They could implement the QNX software into multiple car makes and models, and even use the software in other types of vehicles outside of just automobiles.

On the other hand, BB's QNX software could crumble if it is not competitive and there are better options for car manufacturers.

So what is everyone's opinion on BB? Why should you invest in them, and/or why shouldn't you invest in them? I am still doing my research and would love to talk about this.

EDIT: BB is also very strong in cybersecurity. 9/10 of the worlds largest banks use BB security software to secure data. ",2021-02-11 09:38:11

&#x200B;

Hi all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as ""pegging $GME dead right multiple times during its bubble, making everybody rich on $RIOT, exposing the $PLUG infinite money glitch, accidentally helping start the $BB craze, never getting an $AMD weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the VIX"" or maybe ""The SEC and you:  How you can just say no to having them shove a Mister Fister up your ass"".  Alright, apes, it's been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It's been a great run.  But if you're going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I'm saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c's and a shit ton of 1/22 1.5c's on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you'll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit's profit.

&#x200B;

Here's the TL:DR:  It's basically a penny stock that's gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.

&#x200B;

Hey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.

&#x200B;

# Here's the reality of SNDL:

&#x200B;

The company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.

&#x200B;

In case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.

&#x200B;

Plus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.

&#x200B;

Looking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping ""rumors"" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.

&#x200B;

# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ).

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.

&#x200B;

Look, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.

&#x200B;

As the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.

&#x200B;

# Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party

&#x200B;

But, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

The point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:

&#x200B;

# Canopy Growth

You could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their ""luck"".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.

&#x200B;

# Aurora

If you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its ""shady as fuck"" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.

&#x200B;

# Organigram:

&#x200B;

Look, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.

&#x200B;

# Tilray and Aphria:

&#x200B;

I'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.

&#x200B;

Here's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a ""can't go tits up"" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).

&#x200B;

One of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.

&#x200B;

Fundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.

&#x200B;

# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the  üíéüëê thing

&#x200B;

Ask the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.

Reasons being:

3) A lot of the new traders are looking to make back their bucks from GME AMC etc

Been here for a few months, know a bit, but I'm more of an expert in aircraft. Recently, as you may know, Boeing suffered several major issues with their 737 MAX aircraft, resulting in a 100 USD plunge. Soon after, the Corona virus appeared no less than a year later, resulting in an additional 200 USD plunge. They couldn't just stop the production line, and thus it resulted in Boeing having to [park dozens of their aircraft in the employee parking lot.](https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/06/boeing-737-max-grounded-parking-lot-759.jpg)

However, that's not important. What is important is the recent news that the 737 MAX is now allowed to fly once again, after being grounded since early 2019. This is also in line with the vaccine role out, which is likely going to result in a $BA surge back to it's original price or higher, due to the significant want to travel. Luckily for Boeing, they've got dozens of aircraft already prepped for use, they just need to sell them again. While the stock has been slow to recover, it looks like it will rebound and swing for the fences as airports reopen and people want to travel after being locked inside for so long, leading to a lucrative opportunity in the near future.

Because they were fish and they were retarded they did not know why they were keeping the wall up, they just kept holding. And holding, and holding. As the wall got **smaller** and **smaller** and **smaller**.

This inevitably **cost the fish** lots of energy. So much energy that getting the wall any higher seemed an impossibility. The retarded fish had **no other ideas** and they bickered with each other and snapped at each other for many days. 

Along came a Snail with an **idea so obvious** to him that it was **laughable** that the fish could not see it. Maybe they were just **too close to the problem**. Maybe they were **greedy** and each fish wanted the wall for himself. Maybe they were all retarded. Maybe **they enjoyed being anally reamed**. That it was a pleasure for them to be penetrated so. 

The idea was simple. All it really involved was **leverage**. But the retarded fish didn't understand what leverage meant. They **gave that up to build the wall** in the first place. They had no idea what leverage looked like when they had it themselves. Stupid retarded fish, **leverage is what you are holding,** spoke the Snail.

By dropping that wall, falling back and building the wall at **lower level**, with many **more fish**. They could build a wall that would keep the snakes out. All it would take is some coordination between the **Big Fish** and the **Little Fish**. The **Little Fish** could **retreat** and get ready to build the wall from a **comfortable foundation**. The **Big Fish** could **throw stones** at the snakes **one at a time.** Potentially knocking one out. Once at a level that was desirable and **approachable** from both Big Fish and Little Fish, the Wall could be built on **solid foundations**. Gradually the Fish could **collect stones** for the next push forward **with reinforcements**.

The **Snakes** would relish the opportunity for advancement and **overextend themselves**. They would lead themselves into a **point of no return**. But for the tenacity of the Retarded Fish. Once they get an idea in their heads, it is very hard to change their minds.

But the retarded fish thought the Snails idea was stupid. ""**Leverage**,"" they said ""What's a wall got to do with **Leverage**? Go away crazy Snail. You clearly don't know anything about walls or how to build them. We spent all this energy building this **stupid shitty wall** to this height, you want us to **take it down**. You sound like a snake, you sound like a robot! Psssh... **Leverage**, who does this Snail think he is?!""

The Snail sighed again, as looked upon the struggling fish. He forgave them for their insults. They **did not recognise him** or know he was. They could not see past his **clever disguise,** disguised as a Snail as he was. They did not **know the names** he carried with him in his time. Or the **many battles he had already won**, very similar to this one. If he told them they would never believe him, the Retarded Fish **only believed what was on the screen** in front of them. **As the image of the Wall went down** and down and further down and back up again and down again. Caught in an **endless stalemate**.

**Poor Retarded Fish**! Such a **simple existence** they must get to live, building a wall, only to watch it fall down again and again... It must be **so hard** being Retarded Fish all day. If only they would **try the Snails idea** even if **for lack of a better one**. It's not as if they weren't a **bunch of losers** already. 

**Determined** they were, **to waste more energy**. The Wise Snail looked on and laughed as each day passed and **the Wall the Retarded Fish Built got smaller and smaller**.

I'm here today to tell you about 2 good gold miner stocks I did my DD on, B2Gold \[$BTG\] and Yamana Gold \[$AUY\]!

My DD on B2Gold goes as follows. ITS UNDERVALUED! BTG produces 1 million OZ of Shiny pretty GOLD a year, has practically no debt (121k as of start of 2020). Half a billion cash on hand! Has a P/E Ratio of 8. The dividend the company pays is $0.04/share quarterly. The sales revenue in 2015 was 708.33 Million and in 2019 it was 1.53 Billion, year 2020 will probably top 2019 since gold price went up. Total assets of the company are at around 3.48 Billion while the liabilities are 818.79 Million. Gross Income in 2019 was $597.71 Million. The price of a stock is currently sitting at $5.05 Which is laughably undervalued .üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Yamana Gold \[$AUY\] Slightly worse than B2Gold but still worthy stonk! Price per share currently at $4.91. Total debt at the beginning of 2020 was $991K. Gross Income in 2019 was $446 Million. It has a dividend of 0.02/share quarterly . P/E Ratio of 40 which is kind of poor. But the company is still worth way more than the sub $5 price it's currently at! The company is targeting production of gold to exceed 1 million oz per year! It also produces silver which is an additional bonus!¬†üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Full disclosure I'm 2000 Shares deep in B2Gold, average at $4.97 and 700 shares in Yamana Gold with an average of $4.84 per share.üíéü§≤üíéü§≤

TLRY is going to the moon. Today it closed at $63.91 and is now sitting at $76.41 after hours as I write this. The highest call option for Friday the 12th is $65. There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent. 

TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.

No sources listed since you shouldnt take my smooth brain word for it.

Long $MOS / The Mosaic Company,16,lh3yib,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh3yib/long_mos_the_mosaic_company/,29,1613020170.0,"TL;DR: The Mosaic Company is a U.S. phosphate fertilizer producer, and has tailwinds of (1) rising food prices and (2) favorable regulatory and monopol-y-ish market conditions. I think it could double over the next six months, and am in $35 LEAPs. Earnings are after market Wednesday Feb 17th.

The [U.S. Department of Commerce just determined](https://www.accesswire.com/628789/US-Department-of-Commerce-Issues-Final-Affirmative-Countervailing-Duty-Determinations-on-Phosphate-Fertilizer-Imports-from-Morocco-and-Russia) that phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia, major players in the phosphate fertilizer arena, are unfairly subsidized, with subsidy rates of (a) 19.97 percent for Moroccan producer OCP (b) 9.19 percent and 47.05 percent for Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem, respectively, and a rate of 17.2 percent for all other producers/exporters. The U.S. International Trade Commission has a concurrent investigation to determine whether Moroccan and Russian phosphate fertilizer imports materially injure the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry, with a final ruling is expected by mid-March. If the ITC's ruling is affirmative, then Commerce will issue countervailing duty orders, which will remain in place for at least five years. At a time when supply chains are fragmented and food prices are quietly inflating (see below), the U.S. is protecting its own.

Food price inflation may still largely be unnoticeable in the grocery store, but there are signs elsewhere. Look at the 1year charts for:

$TLRY and $APHA Merger Arbitrage,357,lh3qeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh3qeg/tlry_and_apha_merger_arbitrage/,159,1613019608.0,"
Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won‚Äôt go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

The deal is expected to close around March/April

$TRXC (TransEnterix): already over 1B market cap (DD),158,lh35xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh35xq/trxc_transenterix_already_over_1b_market_cap_dd/,165,1613018131.0,"Dear tards and ladymen,

**DOES EVERY SINGLE POST HAVE TO BE A SHITPOST ABOUT APES BAGHOLDING FUCKING $GME AND OTHER NEWFAG STUFF TO GET ANY ATTENTION?**

**YES, THE MARKET CAP IS OVER 1B, STOP CHECKING RETARDED WEBSITES AND, IN DOUBT, CALCULATE IT YOURSELVES** [**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1)

**TL;DR:**

**The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.**

today I want to bring $TRXC to your attention. I know you already know this stock, but bear with me. It has just crossed 1B market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago, and it has grown over +46% today at the time of writing this DD.

But... who are $TRXC, you may ask?

TransEnterix build the devices... no, fuck this, the BATTLESTATIONS for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparoscopy ([https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:\~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs](https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs).). Their system is called SENHANCE. Essentially, a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and, without opening you up for good, some little arms with tools, cameras, light... are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken. Afterwards, the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks.

OK, OK, you may say, ""why should this shit interest me? Does this not exist already? How do they do it?"". I am glad you ask! This does exist, yes, and the industry standard is the well-known Da Vinci surgical system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da\_Vinci\_Surgical\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System)) by Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG). So what the fuck is interesting about $TRXC? A couple things:

\- Senhance is a more modern system, with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control. SAUCES:

[https://vimeo.com/190579664](https://vimeo.com/190579664)

[https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/](https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/)

The concept is that the surgeon and the machine FUSE INTO ONE, becoming, you know, a Robocop or something like that.

\- TransEnterix bets for AI-POWERED MACHINE VISION to, for example, make the system's camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has THE CE SIGN FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE AND FDA CLEARANCE. SAUCES:

\- Insiders have started moving and buying more stock just two days ago (on Monday):

[https://ir.transenterix.com/node/13316/html](https://ir.transenterix.com/node/13316/html)

[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/876378.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/876378.htm)

\- They have started training surgeons in Japan to conquer their market:

[https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/)

\- And know the boring fundamentals:

Market Cap 1.182B (at the moment of typing this)

Public float 136.01M

Shares outstanding 176M

You can forget about P/E but LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ITS COMPETITOR, $ISRG:

Market cap 91.62B

Public float 116.49M

Shares outstanding: 117.56M

So while the shares outstanding and the float are admittedly larger for $TRXC, they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor which is trading, at the moment, at $788 per share. Of course, of course, it's a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but, to me, they look like a steal EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE. And... wanna see how much they were in the past?

[Oh yes, they were worth a couple dollars more...](https://preview.redd.it/h8spk6lbnpg61.png?width=1667&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea84da4efc9f9d94e6650c9ee908dfa2706401e1)

I might have forgotten something or might have gotten something wrong because, needless to say,

**I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM A BIT RETARDED BUT I JUST LIKE THIS STOCK.**

**The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.**

And this is what such a system looks like, for the jackasses saying ""LoL YoU CalLeD ThAt A BAttLeStatIon""

[Right about to operate the funny jackasses in the comments of a severe case of SUGMA](https://preview.redd.it/42wf4i67qpg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad82b67c8778c34272d3fd093a695cc6b22c061e)

EDIT3: I don't have time to write too much about it right now (this already ate up my fun time today), but their management is also pretty good:

[https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team](https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team)

Might write something on them in the following days.

EDIT4: I did find more fun time. Some doctors in Germany wrote a paper on Senhance, testing its feasibility, and compared it to Da Vinci:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9)

The comparison with Da Vinci points out the reduced cost of using Senhance:

>\[..\] the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic 5- and 10-mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da Vinci¬Æ robotic system which incorporates its own 8- and 12-mm ports \[[27](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-019-00980-9#ref-CR27)\]. Since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system, an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da Vinci¬Æ system. Excluding the acquisition costs of the Senhance‚Ñ¢ Surgical Robotic System, the robot-specific cost per case at our department was 800 Euros, covering the expenses for drapes, instruments and maintenance according to a flat rate-based service contract. This comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 Euros for drapes and instruments with da Vinci¬Æ robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs.

TL; DR: excluding maintenance and acquisition costs, each operation using Da Vinci ($ISRG) costs more than DOUBLE what it costs using Senhance ($TRXC).

And another paper:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6)

This paper is not accessible for free, so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate:

>Our experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the Senhance¬Æ robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery, gynecology, and urology, and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply **a question of time**.

EDIT5: VIRTUAL INVESTOR DAY ON FEB 23. [https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations](https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations)

EDIT6: Article from investorplace [https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/)

>With $90 million in the bank, TransEnterix can last at least eight quarters at this rate. However, the truth is the company is likely to continue to raise capital, especially as its stock price rises. Therefore I don‚Äôt think that TransEnterix will run out of cash to fund its operations.

EDIT7: To complete this DD a little bit: ""Camisa, why do you only say good things about this company? Why are they so cheap and how come their value has changed so dramatically over time?"". OF COURSE there are downsides to the company. For example, how do you explain that they have been around so long and only have systems in 11 hospitals? Well, that's the thing: they haven't sold so many thus far. But this is also the reason why they have been forced to add functionality to become competitive. Whether this is the one time they succeed for good, I do not know - I only have two balls and neither of them is made of crystal.

What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

# Let me put it into context:

When you dispute data from Bloomberg Terminal, the holy grail of Wall Street trading, you've lost the investing game.

We all have opinions, and we can think the other degenerate's opinion is flat out dumb. But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.

The Real Deep Fucking Value ‚Äì KT Corporation,1856,lh2ng0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/,748,1613016829.0,"Apparently we‚Äôre all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD.  With that being said, I present you with the following:


I‚Äôm a fan of DFV the man, but I‚Äôm more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you‚Äôll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  


For those of you kids who can‚Äôt read good, I‚Äôll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it‚Äôs almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don‚Äôt mean by a little bit‚Ä¶ I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I‚Äôll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets ‚Äì which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it‚Äôs trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be <1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  


Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will ‚Äì hell, sell it short if you want ‚Äì but I like shares and calls.


**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**

KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 ‚Äì but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form ‚Äì with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA & Poland.  KT is South Korea‚Äôs first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:


**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**
:--|--:
Mobile Services | 31.4%
Fixed-line local telephone & VoIP | 64.9%
Broadband Internet Access | 40.9%
Pay TV Services | 31.6%


As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.

**Products & Services** | **% of Total Revenue**
:--|--:
Mobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%
Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%
Media & Content | 10.1%
Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%
Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%
Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%


Corporate Location Map:

https://i.imgur.com/syXIRxy.jpeg


KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it‚Äôs worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You‚Äôd literally have to be insane to short it ‚Äì it‚Äôd be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS**

KT‚Äôs balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg


Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg


Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. 

https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg


They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:

I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets. This is REAL value.",2021-02-11 06:13:49

WKHS USPS contract,108,lh1kju,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh1kju/wkhs_usps_contract/,146,1613014163.0,"BLUF: I am long WKHS and believe American-made EV should be the new USPS mail truck. Long time commenter, first time DD‚Äôer; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.

This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‚Äòstick to the HFs‚Äô. Fuck that I‚Äôm just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y‚Äôall to get rich; if you like them great! If you don‚Äôt, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.

WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPS‚Äôs $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor‚Äôs meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president‚Äôs Zero-Emission initiative. Let‚Äôs pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I‚Äôll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:
    -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet
    -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles
    -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)
    -OSK/F‚Äôs submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)
    -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA
    -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players
    -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‚Äòlast-mile‚Äô delivery

But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let‚Äôs talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee‚Äôs and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.

Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:
    -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028
    -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012
    -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600

The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.

Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive?
1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg
2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime
3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up ‚Äúto get exercise‚Äù = way more time for delivery


The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.

With all this being said it‚Äôs obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:

Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.

Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.

Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can‚Äôt come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.

Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.

TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.

My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C‚Äôs at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19
Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Edit 2: Fidelity Investments = \ = Fidelity Mutual Funds, and as such they have different investment strategies. But I see that has escaped the galaxy brains on this post.  

Edit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah 

Edit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think. 

ORIGINAL POST: 
During January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to 9.3 million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital. 

It‚Äôs time to realize that this wasn‚Äôt wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn‚Äôt ‚Äòholding the line‚Äô, just the bag. 

This sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‚ÄòGuhs‚Äô, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn‚Äôt turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving. 

If you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you‚Äôve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you‚Äôre not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will
Inevitably get plowed. Ditto for this fake crusade against Wall Street (which I‚Äôm convinced is cover for people to dump their shares on unsuspecting idiots).

2/10/21, 1:07 PM
Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in GameStop Corp. last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.

Fidelity's GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from 9.3 million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings. The sales ended Fidelity's run as the volatile stock's largest shareholder.

I‚Äôm assuming this was on the 28th of Jan when RH ceased allowing buys. This would seem to be coordinate in a since that RH blocks the retail buyers and Fidelity pushes the shorts to cover at the lower...

Even worse is that the real answer to the thing they claim to want is staring them right in the face.
I'll explain 

    Fuck your shitdeology. Almost every post on GME is barely concealed garbage class warfare shit and is complete denialism almost entirely without any self awareness or actual real evidence. Or trash memes. (KINDA LIKE MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE REST OF REDDIT) What a shock! 

Save WSB please its been completely trashed for a month now. I remember when we would've been seeing dozens of posts about all the ERs going on. Instead its this garbage ideology shit masked as GME love. I made 100k off GME. Great. but if you think it was ever truly about beating hedgefunds you're seriously retarded. I only cared about hedgefunds involved because of the effect it had on the price and the early gamma squeeze that got it moving so rapidly. 

We've got 7 million people who don't know a goddamn thing about economics or finance and only care about those subjects now because they've tricked each other by Circle jerking about how this GME shit is somehow a revolution. 

If you care about that shit. (Which I dont) Then NO, GME isnt a revolution you fucking retards GME was just a single example about how decentralized access to the mechanisms of finance can create a new model for opportunity to ANYBODY regardless of origin that can elevate millions of peoples in this world's level of financial security and freedom.

 And that CAN happen. It can happen if.... if... IF you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics, the fundamentals, the financial institutions, instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual ""revolution"" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing ""rapid"" (but uneven) financial growth. 

Instead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever. You want to be long on GME? Hope the price falls to 20 or lower before earnings and YOLO that shit. (I will) But stop using blatant denialism to ruin a sub and financially ruin yourselves because you're literally just giving money to the hedgefunds that you claim to hate. If you care about poor people getting rich it doesnt require them beating ""the rich"". Melvin shitron shitadel, they're all just a massive drop in the bucket and killing them is just for your young egos it's not even a single bloodstain on the tapestry of wealth inequality or whatever shit you're worried about. Poor people getting rich ISNT reliant on rich people getting poor. Figure that out and you might actually go learn something and start making money. 


THIS ISNT A WAR.

THIS ISNT OCCUPY 2 OR MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THAT SHIT WAS ALSO LEADERLESS, HOPELESSLY AMBIGUOUS, AND BEYOND POINTLESS. 

Go make your own sub if you are actually so unbelievably cancer that you want to continuously post about the exact same fucking thing continuously and forever AND lose money the whole time.

Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD (anymore),130,lgzdsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgzdsg/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad_anymore/,116,1613008570.0,"Welcome back to another Rite aid (RAD) shitpost.  I‚Äôm back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.  



**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you‚Äôre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It‚Äôs okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


**MORE PROMISING NUMBERS**

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it‚Äôs STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.  

My earlier posts were earlier warnings but I‚Äôm yoloing today I think it‚Äôll start to run up again as vaccine distribution ramps up.",2021-02-11 03:56:10
Could Psychedelics (PSYK) be the next weed?,2592,lgz5jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgz5jz/could_psychedelics_psyk_be_the_next_weed/,1025,1613007977.0," 

Marijuana made so much money for those who got in very early. It was originally presented as a medical product, but when regions started to legalize it, it blew up.

Now there's a new ETF dealing in psychedelics (PSYK) that deals in a handful of companies focused on research for the application of psychedelics to treat mental health and other medical issues.

As mental health becomes an increasingly important part of medical research, and as countries around the world continue to lower regulation around the use of various 'narcotics' could this stock have the potential of blowing up?

Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD),677,lgz3x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgz3x2/why_apha_is_an_alpha_trade_in_the_short_and/,274,1613007860.0,"Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are ""unusual expenses,"" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a ""tough on crime"" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Position: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.",2021-02-11 03:44:20

But many of you, esplecially the ones who got burned on GME, don't know which stock to gamble right now because many of them are already 100-200% up. My best advice for you right now is to go balls deep in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC). It's only 10% up since last week and still wasn't affected by WSB autists. [Yesterday they announced that their revenue is up 23% over the same quarter last year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-giant-canopy-growth-surges-12-on-new-profitability-outlook-and-us-legalization-hopes-230939563.html) and their business looks very good and as soon as the legalization thing gets covered, CGC will skyrocket even without this hype so it's an actual long-term investment. And since everyone is buying weed stocks it's a much more attractive pick for you right now.

Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery,46,lgynbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgynbx/amazon_doubles_down_on_grocery/,57,1613006673.0,"Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner‚Äôs third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.

‚ÄúAmazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,‚Äù R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. ‚ÄúIn our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,‚Äù Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe‚Äôs due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

‚ÄúH-E-B and Trader Joe‚Äôs are terrific brands, yet Amazon‚Äôs unmatched convenience is addictive,‚Äù wrote Ms. Goller. ‚ÄúThe dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals‚Äô stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon‚Äôs hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.‚Äù

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of¬†investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was ‚Äúoff to a good start,‚Äù adding there was ‚Äúa lot of interest‚Äù in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

Virgin Galactic $SPCE,286,lgxvh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxvh9/virgin_galactic_spce/,115,1613004708.0,"Dear /Wallstreetbets

&#x200B;

Today I want to talk about Virgin Galactic and the potential the company has. Space travel is vastly developing and together with the EV business this will be the future.

**Chamath** helped Virgin Galactic in the process to go public. Recently Cathie announced that she will create **a Space ETF**. ARKQ has been buying a lot of shares over the last few months. Recently ARKQ sold some shares, but I would consider it normal since the stock is up by 140% since September. I would assume ARKQ took some profits and reinvested them in other companies.

I would like to take a look at the business model of the company. Many ""Bears"" are saying that the business won't be profitable because of the high cost of the tickets. Estimates are that the price for one ticket will be around 250.000 dollars. So their customers would have to be millionaires in order to be able to pay for it. Only 1% of the population is a millionaire. So you would assume it won't be very profitable in the long run.

But let's take a look at the history of flying. In it's early years, flying was very expensive and only a luxury for the rich. Back in 1941, the cost to travel from Boston to Los Angeles was **$4539.24**. In 2015 this only costs **$480.89**. Source: [https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs](https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs)

Space travel might have a similar trend regarding the price of the tickets. Only the rich will be able to afford a ticket to space in the beginning but as technology improves, the business costs will be reduced.

But space travel is not their only catalyst. They are looking into supersonic flights. They made a deal with **Rolls-Royce** regarding this subject. Here's an article for those who are interested: [https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)

I want to talk about the short interest. **The short percent of float is currently 71.95%**! In November the short percent reached its peak at 89.3%. Since then some shorts have been covering their positions as many catalysts are being released. But with a successful flight to space, the stock price might surge and more shorts might give up on their position. I just want to point you out, the stock price in November was $26.61. Currently the stock trades at $56.71. To be honest, they might be sweating right now. Source: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/)

Okay I will finish this DD with a list of **catalysts** which are coming:

\- This **Saturday** Virgin galactic will open the **flight window**. This does not mean they will fly the Saturday, but it will happen within the next few days. There was an unsuccessful flight back in December. But what some people might not understand, is the amount of safety procedures a company has to take. SpaceX for example are shooting up many rockets each year, but there are no passengers. So when a rocket explodes, many people would be fascinated by the explosion. But imagine if a rocket with 3 people exploded. That's why it is so much harder for Virgin Galactic to have a successful flight.

I live in Belgium and I was watching the news here. Back in December the news reported about the failed flight of Virgin Galactic. I didn't expect this at all. But imagine if they have a successful flight. The news would spread around the world.

\- After the successful flight, Richard Branson will go to space later this year. It was scheduled in Q1-Q2 of 2021, but it got pushed back due to the failed test in december.

\- They are expecting to have their first commercial space flight in 2021.

\- Cathie will launch her Space ETF.

I think this stock has a lot of potential and a successful flight will launch this stock. Virgin Galactic will literally bring us closer to the moon. I hope you enjoyed my DD and if i missed something, please let me know in the comments.",2021-02-11 02:51:48

$AUY is a Gold Mine (Both Figuratively and Literally),117,lgxwrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxwrq/auy_is_a_gold_mine_both_figuratively_and_literally/,111,1613004806.0,"Hello Fellow Retards,

I come to you with news from a boomers favorite form of currency: gold. More specifically, a mining company, Yamana Gold. They have earnings tomorrow on the 11th, and based on their previous guidance, they are going to post very strong earnings. Although I hold shares (yeah yeah I know), options are dirt cheap with such low IV. I want to present a case for the company as I believe they have a great year ahead of them.

Now I know gold is down in the past few months, but it still remains as strong as its ever been, and Yamana Gold (ticker $AUY) has been absolutely benefiting from the high prices. With the Feds keeping lending rates low through 2023 and supporting this vision with monthly Treasury bond purchases, this can push down long-term yields. Add this onto the ongoing fiscal stimulus and a steadily increasing money supply, there are many reasons for investors to choose gold in the coming years.

On top of high gold/silver prices, Yamana is looking at a nice increase in production from their Canadian Malartic mine in 2021, and is expected to benefit from higher output at the newer Cerro Moro mine. Yamana is pushing to deeper underground levels at Cerro Moro, which will lead to improved yield and production potential. Yamana's management expects to [produce at least 1 million gold equivalent ounces](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/3-value-stocks-thatll-make-you-richer-in-february/) (GEO) in each of the next three years.¬†

With gold prices up significantly over the past five years, Yamana has also been able to [reduce its net debt](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/29/should-you-buy-gold-stocks-right-now.aspx) by over $1 billion, and increase their annual dividend 425% over 18 months. In a few more quarters at this 1 million GEO annual target, and it just might become net-cash positive.

DD: Cinemark ($CNK) ‚Äì Clear Standout in ‚ÄúMoon Stock‚Äù ScreenüöÄüöÄüöÄ,80,lgy6fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgy6fl/dd_cinemark_cnk_clear_standout_in_moon_stock/,55,1613005473.0,"First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your ‚ÄúHF shill‚Äù comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (‚Ä¶can‚Äôt be sure with half you guys‚Ä¶)

The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it‚Äôs so obvious it hurts. AMC‚Äôs ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.

This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.

**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80¬†

# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)

OK‚Ä¶ Why CNK? Simple: I ran a ‚ÄúMoon Screen‚Äù which looked for:¬†

1. **High Short Interest** (>20% of floatable shares outstanding)
2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn‚Äôt Had A ‚ÄúGME moment‚Äù, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)
3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)
4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)¬†

and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it‚Äôs because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That‚Äôs right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it‚Äôs similarity to GME pre-orbit.¬†

# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)

COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK‚Äôs theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.

&#x200B;

# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World

* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)

Cinemark‚Äôs theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): ‚Äú\[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMC‚Äôs\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.‚Äù **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don‚Äôt fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:

1. Suburban locations have lower rent
2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs

Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be ‚Äúthe only game in town‚Äù in suburbia

In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark‚Äôs customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:

1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater

# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather ‚ÄúCOVID Storm‚Äù

* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID

Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).¬†

Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% ‚Äúfatter‚Äù (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)

Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.

# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness

25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)¬†

&#x200B;

**Valuation/\*Nerd Shit\*:**

* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago¬†
* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.
* EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at¬†700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)

**Target Price: $38.50**

&#x200B;

**Afterthought ‚Äì Takeout Upside:**

* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?
* Just as restaurants won‚Äôt go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second
* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand
* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services

&#x200B;

**Notes/Links:**

**Sean Gamble** \- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*

>""And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it's a limited overlap.""

Not calling for a DD. I say buy in for the short term (Calls) to capitalize on the uptrend to ER, then get out, and determine what you want to do next by the Lockup

&#x200B;

The drop hurts, I know. But understand that this dip is in reality, another buying opportunity that was initiated by a few things.

Firstly the most obvious one, the NASDAQ. It's plunging right now; down, -0.6 atm although it's slowly recuperating it's #'s; good job Sleepy Joe. Since the WSB hype left us during the initial blitz, we now follow the MKT beat for beat. So yeah, I wonder what would happen.

Secondly, you have to consider why people might consider selling. Although we can scream ""to the moon"" all day, in the short term, you'd have to acknowledge how much PLTR has jumped since the Thursday scare, even with the price tanking. Before the SOD, it was at $38, nearly a 20% jump up from 5 days ago. And even with the drop, we're in a very strong, Bullish uptrend. On top of that, we've had 5 ascending closes in a row, differed by pretty big figures, it can't keep doing this for forever. So although as a Long, the reasoning is beyond short sighted and retarded for literally a million reasons, you can at least see where they're at in the head.

Plus don't forget, we're still a top tier MM target and you know deep down they're licking their lips for ER. On top of that, don't forget about all the Retail Traders who are doing so also, but haven't cashed in. It's only Wednesday. ER is Pre-MKT Tuesday. That's a whole week to go through. Wdyt think is going to happen when people realize the beast that's soon to come as everyday passes? You believe we'll be below $30 EOW, with the inevitable hype, like those vegetable brained Bears keep preaching?

Hovering around $36 really isn't that bad, it's just back to where we were 2 days ago, that's still huge progress for a week's time. Longs, remain plush. Late bloomers, don't fret. The upward jump will recrudesce once more, back to tranquility lane.

So as we've all said before. Just hold on tight, buy up those dips and enjoy the ride as the blitz has yet to commence. This is just a minor Pullback, a road bump, in a drive up the mountain.",2021-02-11 02:07:35
Teva Pharma,72,lgwpyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgwpyx/teva_pharma/,76,1613001641.0,"Well, If anyone listened to my last post about ACB and bought some OTM FDs you'd be up a cool 500% if you sold this morning, so figured give this another shot.  

With 2.1billion in positive cash flow Teva has committed to making these changes by 2030 

Specifically, the company has committed by 2030 to:

* Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% versus 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2¬∞C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
* Improve transparency of Scope 3 GHG emissions and increase engagement on climate issues with key suppliers throughout the value chain.
* Increase energy efficiency by 10% and the total proportion of energy purchased or generated from renewable sources to 50%.
* Reduce total water withdrawal by 10% in areas projected to be in water stress.
* Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical ingredients used in operations.
* Reduce the overall mass of secondary and tertiary packaging materials per unit dose and increase the proportion of recycled and responsibly-sourced materials by 10%.
* Assess the environmental lifecycle impact of key products.
* Continue to minimize waste generated from operations and the environmental impact of its disposal.
* Meet existing AMR Industry Alliance commitments to minimize antimicrobial discharges from the supply chain.¬†  

That sounds pretty fuckin green, aka one stock to own during the Biden presidency.

&#x200B;

Also lets look at some projections for next year

 2021 business outlook:

* Revenues are expected to be $16.4 - $16.8 billion (2020 actual results include \~$240 million in revenues from generic products in Japan divested on February 1, 2021, along with a manufacturing site)
* Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.50 - $2.70
* Free cash flow is expected to be $2.0 - $2.3 billion

Someone wanna explain to me how a company projected to do 16 Billion plus in revenue still only have a market cap of 12 billion? Simple it's underpriced.

* Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their **$29 Billion** (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  ([link](https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ev-investment-2025/)) surpassing that of General Motors.
* Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the [2021 Mustang Mach-E electric crossover SUV](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/) which goes on sale later this year.
* Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming [F-150 full-size truck](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2021/2021-ford-f-150-first-look-review/) in mid-2022.
* Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year ([link](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/rivian-backed-amazon-and-ford-aims-ipo-year))
* Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle ([link](https://fordauthority.com/2020/12/ford-transit-in-running-to-become-post-offices-next-delivery-vehicle/))
* The **new Ford Bronco release date** is spring 2021. ([link](https://www.ford.com/bronco/))
* Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.
* Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable 1.30 Dividend Yield.
* And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ([link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-upgraded-to-buy-at-argus-with-a-price-target-that-matches-the-street-high-2021-02-09)).

**Speculation**

With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.

**TLDR**; Ford is 'merica. 'Merica needs electric trucks. Go buy Ford.

APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage,1205,lgw1aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgw1aa/apha_vs_tlry_arbitrage/,562,1612999739.0,"* TLRY and APHA are merging.
* 1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.
* 1 Share of APHA is about 28/share

When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.

So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of 49.8

Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of 33.5ish

OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.

Positions:

APHA 35c Feb 12

APHA Shares

EDIT: Some of you are a little dense.  To be clear, if the results here are

1. TLRY falls to close gap
2. APHA Rises to close gap
3. APHA shareholders realize a large gain in value at time of merger.
4. TLRY RISES more than APHA 

The obvious play would be APHA. In all three situations you are either neutral or gaining.

EDIT2: There ARE, of course, other situations in which you get boned here.  For example, the merger could fall through, TLRY could drop like a stone, BOTH could drop, etc. ",2021-02-11 01:28:59

Technical setup is good. Tons of catalysts in the short-term. Could see this trade to $100-200 on a successful test flight this weekend.

**What the Sell-side is Missing**

You know what the beauty of a pre revenue and a highly disruptive company is? The opportunities are endless and only limited by lack of imagination. Think TSLA early days. 

Yesterday, UBS downgraded SPCE because of its ""stratospheric stock move"", claiming  valuation ""appears full following a 100%+ gain since the start of the year"", while also upping valuation from $35/share to $52/share (aka we are at fair value according to the UBS). We have three things to say to UBS:

1) Virgin Galactic, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, are the top players in an emerging industry, that has the potential to change the way we travel, communicate and harvest resources. 

2) The general investing public has limited understanding that they can invest in space via SPCE; and 

3) You don't hop off of the tendies train before getting to the station

Below we present our DCF showing how we could theoretically make the case for SPCE $2000. These are aggressive forecasts and Virgin Galactic would need flawless execution from here on out, but the possibilities are basically endless. Who knows what will happen in 10 years....UBS sure doesn't.

[Source: We = Me and your dad; not investment advice, do your own dd](https://preview.redd.it/pai22wzt6qg61.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e415773466aa75aed75a19cc6fea7680fc88355)

Here are some revenue drivers that are likely unaccounted for in sell-side models. Ordered from insane to most insane.

**Sub-orbital Pricing**

We expect sub-orbital ticket pricing to be much higher than the sell-side is anticipating. As of right now, the list price for a ticket is $250k...and we expect the first 2000 unencumbered flights to cost $2Mn+. Our rationale stems from Virgin Galactic's ""one small step"" program application where individuals signing up for the waiting list were prompted with options to select their preferred price range. There was a $1Mn+ ticket option and the company inferred in the application that tickets would likely go for $1Mn+. 

[SS2 approaching Space](https://preview.redd.it/s659l5tz9qg61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2661e8ce927ead7d7cbe49484a72e93b3ba2d705)

**Hypersonic Travel**

This will be the most significant revenue driver in the near term if achieved. Hypersonic travel has the potential to upend the existing transatlantic/ultra-long-haul travel regime. We are talking Howard Hughes type stuff. LA to Tokyo in 2.5 hours....unreal. 

While management has remained tight lipped about its hypersonic program, we ultimately expect Virgin Galactic to acquire Boom Supersonic in a stock for stock deal at some point in the next year. We believe that this would speed up VG's go-to-market by three years, with service starting in 2025.

[VG Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/3clhvjfrcqg61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8e321766d6163ddb0eda6b001b7c971e6138c5d)

[Boom Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/oq2l07cwcqg61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6caf58a1c803949b5e7c0d8959827348ff466b)

**Satellite Launch Biz**

While we recognize that Richard Branson's other space company, Virgin Orbit, plays in this space, we would not rule out Virgin Galactic expanding into this business as well. Keep in mind, Richard Branson is a minority shareholder of VG and VG has a fiduciary duty to all shareholders. If Virgin Galactic could adapt its current infrastructure to implement satellite launch capabilities, we would expect them to pursue this business.

Our thoughts stem from: 1) Virgin Galactic's recent petition to the DOT and FAA for more use cases for its mothership, White Knight Two; and 2) White Knight Two was originally a dual purpose aircraft for both sub-orbital human travel and satellite launches.

[WK2 launching satellites](https://preview.redd.it/6l93144uoqg61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b073ee4447586fd23d2b22b69dfb3d1931d2ff8)

**Consumer Division**

The only thing more disruptive to the automotive industry regime than electric vehicles is....flying vehicles. While we believe that SpaceX/Tesla will pioneer the technology, we expect VG to be a top three player if they pursue this opportunity. Again, this is futuristic but possible, and a long time coming. We believe our current revenue forecasts are conservative IF they are able to develop this technology. Again we, and UBS, have no idea what the world will look like in 10 years....so it's possible. VG has the IP and knowledge to be among the first-movers in this space.

**Space Mining**

Screw it, why not? With the environmental conservation push enveloping the globe, we could see mining on earth completely outlawed if humanity is able to exploit asteroid/lunar mining.

**SETUP/TECHNICALS**

Today will be a key day technically. UBS attempted to stop the tendies train with their downgrade yesterday, which caused a slight breaking of trend support. Fear not, we have seen this pattern before and could possibly break the resistance that we have been battling for the last two weeks. We believe we are in the oversold/consolidation phase similar to what we saw last month. We additionally note that by 2pm today the 200 hour moving average will be at current levels adding additional support to the uptrend.

[Hourly SPCE chart](https://preview.redd.it/npz8ggkigug61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bc8f40b4f8dbb7c4acbf88111ec5ee9c8071e)

And if we pull a similar move to last year's parabolic move on a percentage increase basis, we could see SPCE at $136 in the n/t.

[SPCE weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/kzc7y3c2aug61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fda9fd8a31c02b845208e5e3b89b5e06372b67)

Additionally, hype is building quickly. As shown below, the SPCE subreddit sub count is reaching new highs everyday, which we expect to go parabolic should VG have a successful launch over the next week. Keep in mind, the general investing public is still not aware that SPCE exists and we expect broad public equity support after a successful launch.

[Subs on SPCE subreddit ](https://preview.redd.it/j1te6lykxtg61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8725eec85da44a039b5617f284482929d6accc)

Last but not least...the **short interest data**. Virgin Galactic is currently one of the most heavily shorted US stocks with S3 recently noting that there is over $2Bn betting against VG.  We estimate SPCE's public float (ex-Virgin Group/SoCap/Aabar) at 60 million shares (60mn shares\*50 price=$3Bn). We therefore believe that \~70% of the float is short. Additionally, the call option wall is stacked, and any major movement on a successful launch will likely create the mother of all gamma/short squeezes.

**Upcoming Events**

Feb 12-16 - Spacex SN10 launches..spce usually trades as a proxy

Feb 13-18 - Virgin Galactic launches SS2

Feb 25 - Earnings report; we expect update on pricing + potential Boom acquisition

March - SS2 flight 2 and FAA approval

April - Ark Funds launches space etf 

April/May - Richard Branson goes to space

July+ -  Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space. 

**Main Risks**

1) Rocketship breaks

2) the company continues to work at snail's pace

3) Increasing competition

**Conclusion**

As we note in the title, this is a WSB vs UBS story. When UBS downgraded SPCE yesterday, while simultaneously raising their price target to fair value, we shook our heads and asked how is this even possible? Does anyone really know what the world will look like in 10 years...let alone a space company? So in response, we are here to show them that we run our own models and have our own thoughts on Virgin Galactic. Let this be a message to the sell-side from WSB....while ""you try to add value, we straight up create it"" if you know, you know. Strap in ladies and gents, SPCE is about to go on a wild ride.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record high close

> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay ‚Äúpatiently accommodative‚Äù to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is ‚Äúa long way‚Äù from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

*****

> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday‚Äôs closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray‚Äôs short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

*****

> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she‚Äôll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That‚Äôs an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

I can't light up LIDAR"", and your right, you can't. But LIDAR is the key tech that will make automotive cars go vroom vroom, and MVIS has the best version of it.

Here's a little history on the company: üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Used to be part of of a university, then spun off into its own thing.

Traded pretty flat for a while as the team continued to work on their product.

They won the Microsoft Hololens 2 project and are an integral part of what make it work (makes VR go VRoom too) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

For the past 2 years they have been working on their state of the art Long range automotive LIDAR sensors with a planned full demonstration in April.

They released news yesterday AH that they are set to meet and exceed those specs üöÄüöÄüöÄ

In a nutshell, they appear to be a classic case of incredible tech that lacks good marketing and PR. If you look at a comparable company (LAZR), MVIS should have a valuation at least closer to 5B but more likely 10B, which means another 3x to move.

TL;DR MVIS has best tech üöÄüåïüöÄMVIS undervalued üöÄüåïüöÄ MVIS go to moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani 

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.

‚Äã

I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021	Q2 2021	Q3 2021	Q4 2021
11'531'000	13'087'000	14'853'000	16'857'000
This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
USA 12.2020	30'000'000	99	10'016'000	101'000	0.3%
USA 12.2021	30'000'000	99	16'857'000	170'000	0.5%
‚Äã

I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.

‚Äã

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
Switzerland	500'000	99	250'000	2'500	0.5%
Germany	9'500'000	99	4'700'000	47'500	0.5%
Italy	3'300'000	99	1'630'000	16'500	0.5%
Netherland	1'300'000	99	640'000	6'500	0.5%
Poland	2'300'000	99	1'130'000	11'500	0.5%
Spain	3'600'000	99	1'780'000	18'000	0.5%
‚Äã

With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

Thoughts on $CME - potentially undervalued?,135,lhhgyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhhgyf/thoughts_on_cme_potentially_undervalued/,52,1613065897.0,"I was on clubhouse and someone mentioned $CME as a potentially big opportunity. I did some research and agree that this could be a big win. Here are my thoughts .  


The CME Group ($CME) is a U.S. based global market company whose subsidiaries include; Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, The Commodity Exchange, as well a 24.4% stake in the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.  


Yesterday the bears had a field day with $CME resulting in nearly a ten-point drop from the previous days high. The 3.5% drop put the price at $185.20 as of the markets close; this is despite a surprise increase in earnings and a marginal decrease in year over year.   


$CME is currently trading 40 points below its 225 high last February and has a market cap of $66B. However, the company's total assets exceed $117B ($35B more than the previous year) and shareholder equity is approximately 40% of the current market price at $26B.  


This alone is enough for me to believe that the stock is undervalued. By comparison, $AMZN's asset to market cap comes in at 13.55% and their shareholders equity is a mere 5.6%.  


This analysis is strictly quantitative and doesn't account for some very important qualitative aspects that could be cause the stock to rally. ¬†  


As many of you degenerates already know the CME group has created some exciting new futures and options that I cannot mention here but feel free to google it!  


Another important factor to consider is the massive $1.9T stimulus that is slated to make its way to the people over the coming weeks and months. As we have already seen from the previous covid stimulus payments - there will be a significant increase in retail investment more specifically an increase in options and futures trading and $CBE will probably be a major beneficiary due to it\&#039;s subsidiaries.  


In conclusion, I think this is a great opportunity for us . Time to add more diamonds to our hands bois. Let me know your thoughts and what the best play would be?",2021-02-11 19:51:37

* In Europe **Lilium** is doing their own way up from Munich. **Volocopter** too, but in a different way, already flying in Asia for testing. None are public and I think they will not be in a short term.
* **Joby** has done over 1000 test flights and it is the most advanced in all this certification problem with the FAA. It has launched an office in Munich too.
* **Ehang** from China is doing their own way, no idea how they will deal with the FAA and EASA, but China is big enough to have their own business over there if they are not accepted in our countries.
* **Airbus** and **Boeing** are late for this change as old fashion automakers are for the electric cars. To big to change the direction of their businesses, although both of them have their own program. Airbus a bit more ahead than Boeing, although none of them achieved major milestones.

So the idea of having a public company within EEUU with a higher probability of being accepted in Europe is a great opportunity.

DLB and why it is undervalued for what it does,38,lhgpwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhgpwj/dlb_and_why_it_is_undervalued_for_what_it_does/,43,1613062739.0,"What‚Äôs good fellow gamblers, degenerates, quaalude parachuters, and newbies.

It‚Äôs ya boy, ElJefe here and I am here to share with you how Dolby is an undervalued and often overlooked company that actually has more potential than meets the eye.

Dolby‚Äôs most recent earnings from their fiscal 1st quarter showed a strong YoY total revenue increase of 33.57% ($389.9 million, compared to $291.9 million). Where it gets interesting is that their cost of products and services decreased by 10.47%, their cost of revenue decreased by 5.39%, and this resulted in a 39.28% **increase** in their gross margin. They were also able to shave 7.8% off their operating expenses while increasing their operating income by **239%**. Their  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased from 0.64 to 1.48.

**Dolby is thickly cash heavy.**

They make most of their money from licensing its audio technologies to broadcasters, television OEMs, computer manufacturers, gaming console companies, and cell phone makers. With royalty‚Äôs being 95% of their revenue, this is a strong business model that is able to create steady cash flow.

Their numbers are impressive and if you want to take a further look you can dive in here https://investor.dolby.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dolby-laboratories-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial.

**Dolby Vision** and **Dolby Atmos** have been extremely popular and are used in Broadcast, Mobile, Consumer Electronics, PC, Cinema. Think of the amount of TV‚Äôs, smartphones, home stereos, etc that are being sold that use these two technologies. Consider the recent iPhone ‚Äúsuper cycle‚Äù as one example to put into perspective how many devices will be using Dolby‚Äôs technology. Also consider that the demand for premium home entertainment has increased due to people spending more time at home. One other thing is that there is a higher demand from e-commerce platforms for audience-engaging content, which is increasing sales of Dolby Vision. Then there are the movie theaters, once they reopen of course, which is going to even further increase cash flow.

Do you know a company that uses Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos a decent amount? Netflix. 

 
They of course have other products: long list >! The company develops and licenses its audio technologies, such as AAC & HE-AAC, a digital audio codec solution used for a range of media applications.; AVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency used in media devices; Dolby AC-4, an audio coding technology that delivers new audio experiences to a range of playback devices; and Dolby Atmos technology for cinema and a range of media devices. Its audio technologies also include Dolby Digital, a digital audio coding technology that provides multichannel sound to applications; Dolby Digital Plus, a digital audio coding technology that offers audio transmission for a range of media applications and devices; Dolby TrueHD, a digital audio coding technology providing encoding for media application; Dolby Vision, an imaging technology for cinema and media devices; Dolby Voice, an audio conferencing technology; and HEVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency to support for media devices. In addition, the company designs and manufactures digital cinema servers, cinema processors, amplifiers, loudspeakers, hardware components, video conferencing solutions, and other products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Further, it offers various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment. The company serves film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers. It sells its products directly to the end users, as well as through dealers and distributors worldwide.!<

Dolby is arguably one of the most expertly managed technology companies from a financial standpoint.  Their capital deployment philosophy includes investing in new growth technologies and rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Their balance sheet never carries any long-term debt and currently includes $1.1 billion in cash...

Seems like a steal for $93...

DD - Why I think we're at the ground floor for $KLIC,157,lhfv63,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhfv63/dd_why_i_think_were_at_the_ground_floor_for_klic/,69,1613058779.0,"Due to the global microchip shortage, automation companies involved in the production of microchips are doing well, $KLIC (Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc) is one of them. In my opinion it's üöÄüöÄüöÄ (obligatory rockets for bullish sentiment)  for this stock.

They build automation and tools for the production of microchips. When investigating this company, I found this video to be very useful [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg) they seem to prioritize customer retention and have developed a configurable system from listening to customer feedback.

There's a few reasons why I think this company is going to do very well in 2021:

* They are addressing a known bottleneck. PS5s and X-Box aren't being built fast enough due to supply chain issues: [https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html)
   * I'm a big believer in removing bottlenecks. I assume that all companies involved in the supply chain for consoles, computers, etc. are investing in expediting their processes (similar companies to $KLIC are also doing well and business has picked up in 2020 and 2021, you can search for competitors if you want, there are similar trends).
* Solid balance sheet and positive trends:
   * Book value of approximately $13.01 per share. This is about 807 MM. For additional context, their current market cap is at 2.7 billion [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value)
   * Zero debt [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly)
   * Solid recent growth. Most of their 1yr growth has occurred in the last 2-3 months. I suspect this is institutional diversification, but who knows.
   * This ticker is beginning to make some noise: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic)
   * I think this company is less vulnerable to rug-pulls, I think there's enough value, momentum and global business need for what they are doing.

There are a few risks:

* Relatively unknown company. I found it when investigating other companies. I didn't pay much attention at first. I think there's many others like me.
* COVID demand will not last forever, at least not at the current levels; however, I think there's still months, perhaps years of built up demand. I don't expect we'll go back to normal any time soon or ever. More people will continue to work from home when comparing to years like 2018.
* This is not a sexy company. I don't really mind that, but let's be honest, that's not helping in attracting any eyeballs. This is the biggest risk IMHO in the current market.
* I'm sure there's other risks that I have not identified.

**This is not investment advice, you are responsible for your own decisions**. If you choose to invest in any stock, I'd recommend you to remember that no stock is worth all your money, invest for the long run and when you think you've made adequate profits and are ready for the next opportunity, move on. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

Positions:

YOLOed 40 60c(07/16 expiry) @ $1.10, thinking of selling other positions to buy shares and go longer (again, no stock is worth all my money, I will not put all of my money in this ticker). This is a personal preference, to each their own.

&#x200B;

Edit:

This post has received a bit more attention than I expected. Thanks for looking at my DD. I'll address a few things here cause I got stuff to do, would like to respond in a more personal manner, and will try to do so later.

* First and foremost, thanks for the Gold /u/Far-Escape-7553 there was no need, but the gesture   
 is much appreciated.
* Thanks for those who have offered challenging positions. I'm in the process of developing my active trading strategy and I'm trying to achieve a mixture between value+momentum for active trades. If you offered a challenge I will look into that to see if I can improve my process.
* For those who challenge my account history. Not a bot or HF drone. Long time lurker that wanted to add a bit of variety to the sub.
* Also, I think I should have said this initially:
   * I don't think this is the next meme stock, I hope it isn't because I don't want to worry too much about exiting at the right time.
   * If I'm ""too right"" and this booms, I do not plan to post position updates because I don't want the burden of having people hold as long as I hold.
   * If I'm wrong and this tanks, I hope that not many of you shares in the losses. Only you can determine your exit strategy, please remember to have one!",2021-02-11 17:52:59

How a short/gamma squeeze on Tilray is causing the ENTIRE cannabis market to moon and how to avoid becoming a bag holder when this all comes crashing down,13404,lhf2qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhf2qw/how_a_shortgamma_squeeze_on_tilray_is_causing_the/,3153,1613055275.0,"***Obligatory: SIR, THIS IS A CASINO. This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form.***

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in.

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

WKHS DD: Zero chance of winning a significant portion of USPS contract,214,lheq8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lheq8x/wkhs_dd_zero_chance_of_winning_a_significant/,126,1613053794.0,"I fully expect to get pushback for this, but here goes.

**THESIS**

Workhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.

In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.

Part 1: History of Self Promotion

Part 2: The USPS Contract

Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability

Part 4: Positions or Ban

\---------------

**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**

WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:

* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)
   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?
* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)
   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a ""blue chip customer.""](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)
* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016
   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)
* Several other examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.
* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.
* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)
   * Let's take a look at that fine print: ""The order is split between Workhorse‚Äôs C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions."" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

\---------------

**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**

There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.

First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:

* Workhorse
* Ford-Oshkosh
* Karsan-Morgan Olsen

*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel issues further below.*

Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):

1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.
2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)
3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.
4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles
   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.
   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.
5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).

So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.

I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I‚Äôll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we‚Äôre ready for that. Now we‚Äôve got our fingers crossed. We believe we‚Äôve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,‚Äù John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  
>  
>Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)

And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):

>**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  
>  
>I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS‚Äôs needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  
>  
>**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  
>  
>**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.

So USPS has the following options:

1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.
2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).

Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]

\---------------

**PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY**

I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say ""Lordstown"" like it means something.

This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.

\---------------

**PART 4: YOLO**

Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.

More $KT DD,191,lhe9k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhe9k9/more_kt_dd/,46,1613051865.0,"Earlier today u/clubba posted some good DD on $KT - Korea Telecom - looking at the low price/book ratio. It's a good metric to get a lead on potential value plays (LOL at WSB turning into a value stock forum, way to go DFV), but there's more to look at.

Book value tells you if the company has underlying value or if it's just a house of cards. Price to book ratio tells you *what the market thinks of that underlying value.* In this case, almost nil. A good question to ask when you see a metric that seems way too positive to pass up is, why are other people passing it up?

First, more about the company: they do mobile networks, sat TV, finance (credit cards), and infosec services. They also do some robotics cause it's fun?

Telecom was one of the worst performing sectors over the past year, by the way. This can be a positive if you're a value investor-it means the price may be depressed by the broader industry.

To the stock itself, the value play isn't as strong as the price to book makes it out to be. Again, if that tells you it has underlying value, great. But is it making any money? Price to earnings is 8 or 9 (depending if you're looking at the past year or projected), compared to 12ish for the industry, another good sign. Earnings growth projections are positive also, but not phenomenal. ~~Negatively, they did not pay a dividend last year, which is like value investor 101: show me the dividend!~~ **Correction: evidently they typically announce dividends in the spring, and backdate the ex date to the prior year, which is why no sites are showing a 2020 divided yet.** But they did announce a share buy back and a 2021 dividend. They have a comparatively small market, and have branched out internationally as a result. That can be expensive.

Tl;dr - I think there are positive signs for a long term value play, but what this company is lacking is meaningful growth. The point of investing is to make money, not just hold value.

I'm going to watch it, because if they do a spin off or some other move to position for innovation or greater market share then it could be poised to take off.",2021-02-11 15:57:45

Either it's all a bunch of retards or some organized folks making the posts (or both)...

It's like you could just start a pump based off news like earnings or a weed merger or whatever, and then try to keep the pump going higher using retail investors who will never exit when they should. Easy extra gains if you can manipulate the market already with large volume alone and then get a bunch of retards to buy due to FOMO.

I'm really skeptical of all of these stocks that have already gone parabolic and you get these people saying it will still ""go to the moon"" with no counter arguments. Yea maybe they will but maybe they won't but nobody knows for sure.

If the US political cycle had shown us anything, it's that it is easy to manipulate people on the internet. Feelings will often win over facts too (apes strong yada yada)... it's like playing the lottery but with bigger consequences.

Retail investors do have power again, but that power could be so easily pulled one way or another by these meme stocks.

All I'm saying is do your own research before yoloing your retirement away or getting into debt....

Here are a few lessons from the wild swing in stocks like $GME, $BB, $AMC, $NOK that are being discussed endlessly here:

* Nobody here is going to handhold a noob! If you haven‚Äôt ever traded in the stock-market , don't come to these forums to ***learn*** *to invest or trade.* 
* The forums may be a good place to gauge the sentiment on stocks, but ***not*** to gather *real* investment insights
* Gain and Loss porn posts by fellow retards may be entertaining but sometimes it is just that - entertainment. There may not be much to learn from their *experience*
* Recent swing in Gamestop (GME) stock has shown that a herd of retail investors alone can't sustain the momentum in stock price, especially if the underlying fundamentals aren't supporting it.
* You alone are responsible for gains and losses in *your* portfolio. Remember, you and I also have bills to pay.

"Wed AM Gamma Analysis & Trading Day Retrospective on GME, TLRY, APHA, SNDL, CRSR, AMC",613,lhdeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhdeep/wed_am_gamma_analysis_trading_day_retrospective/,212,1613048504.0,"Below is a dump of a bunch of popular tickers. Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve ""Stevie"" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened.

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Edit: Thursday 2:20pm EST analysis:**

All stocks at the end of the day require NET BUYERS to go up.  My interpretation with the broad collapse of 420 stocks is just that people took profits/not enough new buyers. The gamma ramps that can shoot stocks up ALSO can shoot them down if you run out of buyers and go to net selling. That appears to be what is happening. That also means if there are inflows they can shoot back up though.

**Brief analysis:**

**GME**: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being ""The"" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did, and we can in turn expect a spectacular pop when people get distracted and move on to the new shiney. Be cautious! I'll do more TLRY bubble analysis below.

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying.

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn‚Äôt accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don‚Äôt expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isn‚Äôt actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It‚Äôs right in the middle of a decent sized gamma ramp, so buying will send it up somewhat faster ‚Äì and selling will send it down somewhat faster. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result.

**AMC**: I‚Äôm not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float ‚Äì this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR.

**TLRY Bubble Analysis**

Tilray long ago on about 75m shares got to $180 in a bubble, and that popped a little without insider lockup... when lockup happened it killed a new surge in jan 2019, sending it down a bit to $70.  We are now at 130m shares outstanding.  That means the shares outstanding went up 73%, and float probably is up a bit more post-lockup, so let's call it 80%. 70 bucks divided by 1.8 is $40, which represents similar mini-bubble prices, which we are over. Therefore, while I think this can and probably will go higher, I don't think we are going to hit the $180 easily. We might see $100 or $120. But I think this is starting to get into heavy lift territory.  Another view would be to see that GME was about $10b-$15b of retail money in, and TLRY market cap is $8b already.  If I think GME was max retail money in, maybe TLRY can get half of that. That puts a barrier on it getting past the low to mid 100s in my opinion. My advice is - this looks like it's beginning to be a bubble - best practice in a bubble is to not get greedy, and take profits as you go. Bubbles pop when new money in slows. I personally don't trade them because they are my worst trading skill. Good luck!

**Vulture Strategy**

Whenever everyone is FOMOing hard over these stocks, they tend to dump prior favorites to buy - stuff like NFLX, TSLA, whatever the last memes were, random banned stocks here that we also watch. Some of those favorites are quality stocks, and others are the next meme next week that aren't yet in the limelight. If you have long-standing S&P500 or Nasdaq-100 stocks that are down for no real reason big tomorrow (and today), or a meme favorite, you may just want to snag some shares cheap if you aren't feeling these stocks. May see some more flash sales.

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow. I intend to enter into positions on none of these, because I'm a square.*

Because we got invaded by r/investing I'm supposed to say this isn't financial advice or investment advice, and it sure as hell isn't either of those! Go make your own decisions and learn to trade, ffs. Let's be real, these are speculative trading stocks at these prices (other than maybe CRSR), not really investments.",2021-02-11 15:01:44

APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage creating biggest short squeeze,0,lhdclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhdclf/apha_vs_tlry_arbitrage_creating_biggest_short/,52,1613048343.0," 

A lot of people are making the APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage play in the past few days, that is, buying APHA and shorting the same amount of TLRY, thinking it is free money based on the ""future"" share exchange ratio after the merger. What they didn't realize is that they are helping to increase short interest in TLRY and adding oil to one of the biggest short squeezes in stock history, that is unfolding in front of us right now.

Let me explain, in the long term they would be right ""eventually"", either APHA is too cheap or TLRY is too expensive. However at the moment stock market doesn't have to make sense and can head in the opposite direction for a prolong period of time, and as TLRY gets higher it will trigger broker's automatic short-covering at \*any\* price when some shorters' net balance get close to zero. This will push TLRY even higher and shake out more accounts, triggering a snowball effect. Unfortunately, there is no way to convince your broker that your APHA ""long"" shares are as good as TLRY shares and that you are self-sufficient. In fact, these APHA shares also take away some of your cash balance and contribute to the automatic short-covering.

I haven't seen this kind of short squeeze before and would welcome any thoughts.",2021-02-11 14:59:03

$TLRY,138,lhd3ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhd3ww/tlry/,225,1613047442.0,"$TLRY and $APHA are scheduled to merge in Q2 in an all stock deal. $APHA investors will receive. 8381 shares of $TLRY. 

In these mergers hedge funds usually make their money by doing something they deem risk free called arbitrage. By shorting the expensive stock and being long on the less expensive stock it doesn't matter if the stocks go up or down the only thing that matters is that on the merger date they would be worth whatever the price paid for them is. 

So in $TLRY and $APHA case in an arbitrage position the profit is the difference between where they are now and where it would be if $APHA is 83% of $TLRY stock price.

So here is where we could blow up the hedge funds.

SHORT SQUEEZE $TLRY. 

Instead of TLRY becoming closer to that 17% premium the difference in price has widened and there is a lot of institutional shorting going on. Short interest is currently 37% of the free float. One out of every three shares floated is being shorted.  

On a low volume stock. 

TLRY could also with that higher share price renegotiate the deal and get more APHA shares or look for a different target to merge with. 

As TLRY shareholders we could call for a vote (forcing all the shorts to close) to form a comitee to entertain buyout offers.g",2021-02-11 14:44:02
