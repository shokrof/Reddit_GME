Why Alex needs to crash the stock...,0,llo1ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llo1ru/why_alex_needs_to_crash_the_stock/,0,1613572526.0,Lockup expiry is comin. If the price is good enough a bunch of employees will cash out and go on to start their own startups. Alex needs these folks to stay on to grow the company (hence the going overboard on ESOPS). So he needed to crash the stock today hence the bullshit sandbagging of growth expectations during todays PLTR call. He is trying to hold on employees by making them think I should wait till 45 before selling my stock. And even though I can leave I better stay and make sre the company grows so that the stock hits 45 again.,2021-02-17 16:35:26

The least sexiest move: Shipping container stocks.,40,llgxfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llgxfn/the_least_sexiest_move_shipping_container_stocks/,45,1613547973.0,"Import/export and shipping container stocks

Listen up apes! Some least exciting stocks with room for growth in the current economic situation are shipping & shipping container stocks. The growth potential is being caused by global macroeconomic causes. Currently there is a shipping container shortage due to high demand of overseas freight. The US is buying consumer goods from China in record volumes ( surge of at-home goods, PPE, fitness equipment etc. produced in China). (Also why your wife can‚Äôt get that pelaton rn) This has lead to the increase in shipping container transport costs. A typical shipping container pre-pandemic would go for around $1,500 from China to the US, then be loaded back with soy beans,and other things(or whatever China wants) to send back. Due to the high volume shipping companies have increased the container shipping (or ‚Äúlease‚Äù of container space) price to the US around $4,800+  It has become so profitable for shipping & container companies that they are preferring to send containers back empty to China to be put back in queue for US goods to be exported. Meaning the trip from China to the US alone is so profitable it pays for the roundtrip costs itself without needing return cargo back to China. 

Companies and exporters who want to ship abroad pay a heftier premium and either have difficulty finding a container or space to ship goods internationally now. If the product is a high enough priority they may elect to send it by more expensive air cargo. Stocks with growth potential are, Triton Int. (TRTN), CAI to name a few.(Yes there are others do your DD.) Triton released its Q4 earnings report today 2/16 with positive revenue(337M)and EPS(1.70) up from Q3. These stocks have potential in the midterm to longer term for growth. (That‚Äôs right no sexy shorts here) Trade disputes between China and the US could also spark more growth in the stocks(in favor of China currently) , but trade policy revisions by the Biden administration could quickly cool any spikes in shipping and stock prices.

"Personal opinion: Increased my GME position by about 20% today, not recommending you do the same.",1299,llftek,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llftek/personal_opinion_increased_my_gme_position_by/,311,1613544564.0,"It could very well continue to go down, but even so, I'm only adding about 4% to total dollar amount ~~wasted~~ ""invested"" for a 25% reduction in cost average. It's a small price to pay for a significant risk reduction. 

My reasons for not writing this stock off:

1) Like many here, I got into it late in the game and \~80% down as of right now. The current residual risk of losing 100% of the investment is only 20%. The potential upside is much higher.

2) There is a large amount of calls up to $800 for the next 4 weeks that were bought by much bigger entities than baby powder snorting retards of this subreddit like myself. I want to see how that plays out.

3) There are ongoing government inquiries, no global consensus on the SI, and lots of other factors that make it a useless exercise to try to predict anything at the moment.

4) I'm not much of a gamer, but I actually like the company. I think there's a lot of opportunity for growth from many angles, just based on the industry alone. I feel like we're kind of maxed out as a society on creating original movies. I don't believe that we can just continue cloning sequels and remakes like the Hollywood's been doing for the past 10 years. Video games on another hand are becoming more and more immersive and are equally fun and story-rich as movies, some may argue even better. Generationally, more and more people are going to be accustomed to gaming as well as they get older. The shift will take some time, but it's already happening.

TLDR: Whatever it is you do in life, don't panic, take deep breaths, hydrate, get outside, and and listen to good music.

DDDD - Was GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold Part 2 (A look at Jan 15 to 29 SEC Data),1410,llmiu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llmiu1/dddd_was_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/,167,1613566697.0,"In this DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be analyzing some Failure to Deliver (FTD) data released by the SEC for Jan 15 - 29 to definitively see if there's been any shady shit going on with GME; namely, illegal (or legal by MMs?) naked short selling. This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**What is a Failure to Deliver?**

A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.

**Methodology & Caveats**

I'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is

1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?
2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?
3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**

The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.

Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.

**The Code**

Feel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.

Hopefully, this data speaks for itself, but as a TLDR

What does stand out is that GME has the most days with FTD > $25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (> $1B) in the SEC list

but

Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you **normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers**. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn't look like there's any systematic fraud going on.

**TLDR;  ASO is an outdoor recreation company, that is a genuinely undervalued compared to comparables that will continue to benefit from ammo shortage inflation**

There  has been some very good DD posted lately on VSTO and them as a solid  play due to the ammo shortage. I am here to educate you about a  comparable that has not gotten as much attention, ASO.

**Fundamental shit (via filings and yahoo finance)**

VSTO  trades at a p/e of 36 currently. ASO is trading at a p/e of 10 with a  similar market cap and float. ASO is currently also operating at a  higher profit margin (4.3%) comparable to VSTO (2.81%) and they have  comparable cash on hand. They do however carry more debt and have not  seen as high a yoy growth. Their free cash flow is significantly higher  though. **P/s ratio is .39 vs. VSTO's .88**  (Lower is better here, you're paying .39 cents for every $1 in sales).  ASO also has a slightly higher market cap at just over 2 bil.

In terms of raw numbers, ASO is actually closer to competing with DKS in the outdoor leisure space, with the added bonus of the ammo shortage. for reference DKS trades at \~$73 with a P/E of 17 and a p/s of .74. Analyst consensus is $27 for ASO, but if they post another er similar to Decembers in April they could easily be trading in the $50 range at just a slightly higher p/e.

**My own thoughts and such**

BUT RETAIL IS DEAD!!!! Sure, but Academy is concentrated in red states that have been open for months where you can buy guns and ammo when its in stock. I checked google maps for this part, I aint driving my nyc ass out to investigate. 

All  this out of the way I see ASO as a good medium to long term investment.  It also stands to benefit from the HUGE backlog of ammo orders in the  short term (estimated currently around 1 billion dollars worth). It has  more room to run than VSTO IMO and can easily catch up to DKS.

**The reason you want to check it out**

Now you're probably asking, why the fuck do I care about a good long medium-long term investment on WSB? Well aside from their April earnings call, lets talk about the elephant in the room. Short Interest. As per YF its 39% of the float, and from all the sources I could find are the highest in the entire Russell 3000. They also IPO'd in October, and are currently near the 52 week high which was reached just last week. Every short is reasonably assumed less than current share price. In a company with large growth potential, that posted a great 1 st er  in Dec (seriously they damn near tripled eps estimates). High end estimate has been raised for April,But the midpoint looks like an easy beat still.

**INTRODUCTION**

1. CMPS is a biotech company that has received breakthrough therapy status from the FDA and is using a patented synthetic version of psilocybin (i.e., the active agent in ‚Äúmagic mushrooms‚Äù) to target the treatment-resistant depression (TRD) market of >100 million people who have tried two or more existing treatments without success.
2. To be clear, COMPASS Pathways is a biotech/pharma company with world-class thinkers and investors. This is not about recreational drug use.
3. Thiel is an investor, owning 7.5% of this, along with other big names.

**THE TEAM**

4. CMPS‚Äô stacked board of directors and scientific advisory board includes:‚Ä¢ David Norton ‚Äì former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson‚Ä¢ Tom Insel ‚Äì former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and co-founder of Mindstrong Health‚Ä¢ Thomas Lonngren ‚Äì former executive director of the EMA (i.e., the European FDA)‚Ä¢ Professor Alan Schatzberg ‚Äì Director at the Stanford Mood Disorders Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine‚Ä¢ Professor David Nutt ‚Äì Neuropsychopharmacology chair at the Imperial College London, President of the The European Brain Council‚Ä¢ Chief Development Officer Trevor Mill who spent the past 25 years at Biogen, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson leads the CMPS R&D department.

**PRICE TARGET**

‚ÄúYou get paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of problems you solve‚Äù ‚Äï Elon Musk

5. The TAM for people with depression who have failed two or more previous treatments is over 100 million people. There has not been much innovation in mental health since the invention of Prozac in 1988.

6. Tom Insel, former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) stated: ""Mental healthcare needs innovation‚Ä¶ The COMPASS medication-assisted psychotherapy strategy is innovative in that it integrates medication and psychotherapy. And it is disruptive by offering patients a treatment that many people prefer.‚Äù

7. At a current market cap of 1.6B, the PT is to reach the same market cap as Tilray during the weed boom; implying a **10x** valuation to $500 a share.

**CATALYST**

8. Biden Administration. With the push for weed legilisation, the next step would be psychedelics, where the results have been astounding for depression (also many other uses, like reduced smoking, binge drinking, etc)

9. FDA Approval - Expected 2022 - 2023. Phase 2b trial data available late this year. Expecting a huge pop when the data shows late this year. Phase 1a trial showed an incredible efficiency of 4/5 patients with significant improvement (No data collected on the 1/5 patients).

**FUNDAMENTALS**

[4h chart](https://preview.redd.it/zwoakavvtyh61.jpg?width=1671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f732f93b45a66d96435fecb36c0c75f2d2efefe)

10. Looking at the 4H chart, the resistance SMA has become the support for current price action, with a clear bounce off the SMA line. RSI showing a reversal.

11. Current market cap of only $1.6B.

**CONS**

12. Biggest drawback is that the company only has one drug (as far as the public knows). You are essentially banking it all on this one drug.

13. Company makes $0 revenue now. Its all R&D.

**CONCLUSION**

Early mover's advantage from CMPS, pioneering the use of psychedelics to combat mental illnesses. My personal 10 bagger stock, with 250 shares in.

EDIT: Position: 250 shares at 51.6585 on 12 Feb.

Now that Joe Biden has taken over the office of the president, we are seeing a push to decarbonize the economy, and what better way to decarbonize the economy than nuclear energy? Nuclear energy will soon be the poster child for clean energy. There are three things you need to know about nuclear energy, it produces minimal waste, its land footprint is small but most importantly (at least for us investors) it‚Äôs a zero-emission clean energy source. Why is this important for us investors you ask? Nuclear energy generates power through a process called fission. Fission is the process of splitting URANIUM atoms. For all you mouth breathers that aren‚Äôt following along...
üíéCLEAN ENERGY=URANIUM. üíé

If you want to get rich during the Biden Administration and beyond you need to get your filthy little hands on some sweet Uranium. However, there are multiple Uranium companies out there, how do you choose the right one? Well boys and girls, I‚Äôm here to tell you about this great uranium mining company called Denison Mining Corp (DNN)

Denison Mining Corp (DNN) is a uranium mining company based out of Canada. This company is a lucrative buy because it owns 90% of the Wheeler River project which is at this point in time the largest undeveloped high grade uranium project. Denison mining is perhaps in possession of the single best uranium deposit in the world. We are still in the infancy stages of this company and all it has to offer the world of clean energy. Their market cap just hitting $1 Billion today, which is just the beginning. So if you‚Äôre trying to get to the moon, hop aboard the DNN rocketship.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄWE LIKE THE STOCK, REMEMBER CLEAN ENERGY=URANIUM, URANIUM=DNNüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

As always, do your own DD! It‚Äôs your money, only you can decide what stocks will take you to tendie town! I‚Äôm not a expert nor is this financial advice.

EDIT: So adding this on after reading some comments against nuclear energy. The real question is not whether you personally believe nuclear energy is the future, it‚Äôs whether the governments and other entities in charge think it‚Äôs the future. It would be great if we could all do geothermal, solar or wind but those sources don‚Äôt work in every geographic location.",2021-02-17 12:29:08

Altria operates the Marlboro brand in the US and commands ~50% of the US cigarette market. Altria is perfectly poised to dominate the US marijuana industry. Just how likely is this? Senator Chuck Schumer [is shitting his pants over it.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/amp/)

Why will Big Tobacco, and Altria more specifically, win the Weed Wars? They are the only companies with the distribution channels and regularity experience to succeed in what is likely to be the rapidly changing environment of the legalized marijuana market. In addition, Altria has been taking major steps in this direction recently, purchasing a 45% stake in major Canadian marijuana company Chronos in 2017, and recently filing a number of patents related for vaping devices with the ability to deliver either THC or CBD in measured doses.

Here‚Äôs the good part. Altria‚Äôs core business is already way under-valued due to poor management decisions that led to one-time investment write-offs. So undervalued that it‚Äôs one of the top holdings in Michael Burry‚Äôs Scion Asset Management fund. And on top of that, options on $MO are dead cheap, hovering near 20% IV. For instance, Jan 2023 $65c‚Äôs are only $1. I believe that if marijuana is legalized, $MO will re-rate and could hit $90, giving those options a 2,500% upside from today‚Äôs price.

In summary, stop playing around with insanely high IV and over-valued speculative weed companies, and bank on the winner that was right in front of you this whole time.

Others were/are thinking that Shell is a pure oil company and that oil is something from the past. From their point of view, we will live in a completely different world without plastics, without non-EV, without pills (yes you need oil to make pills, medication) etc. Aka they are also delusional.
The REAL REASON why the stock price plunged: they cut the dividend.

BUT on the other hand, they announced that they will increase the dividend each year with at least 4% AND they will buy some shares back as soon as their debt is bellow 65 billion. (I think they might also increase the dividend even more when they reach this target, the stock price will go up in each case) ‚ÄúShell outlined a long-term plan to reduce debt to $65 billion and to aim for shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow‚Äù [link](https://www.oedigital.com/news/482818-ceo-says-shell-s-oil-production-peaked-in-2019)

WHY WILL THEY HAVE LESS THAN 65 BILLION DEBT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTUR

Look at those oil prices!! 13 month high!! They will keep going up!! [link](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Flocked-To-WTI-Crude-Ahead-Of-Texas-Cold-Snap.html) [link](https://www.pennlive.com/life/2021/02/gas-prices-at-highest-in-a-year-and-expected-to-increase-more.html)
Shell has a break even price of 31$ per barrel, this means that they make 32$+ PROFIT per barrel with a Brent oil price of 63$+. 
Shell produced about 920k barrels per day in Q4 2020 aka during the second big worldwide lockdown aka worst case scenario [link](https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2020/shell-fourth-quarter-2020-update-note.html)
So what does this mean? They are making a fuck ton of money and they will reach the 65 billion debt very soon.

Shell is a ENERGY stock, NOT just oil.
Shell also produces hydrogen and natural gas (LNG).

You know what‚Äôs also at a 12 month high? That‚Äôs right, gas!!! [link](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-called-higher-as-severe-cold-brings-chaos-to-u-s-energy-markets/)

EXTRA HIGH natural gas and oil prices because it‚Äôs extremely cold and refineries are closing, it can take several weeks to get them fully operational again [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-u-oil-refinery-shutting-180345565.html)

SHELL will become a carbon neutral company by 2050 [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56022908)
They will gradually make this change, this is healthy for the company. Here is a non exhaustieve list of what this change implies:
-Shell acquired UK‚Äôs largest EV charging network [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubitricity-m-a-shell-idUSKBN29U0TC)
-This is a huge one: Shell made synthetic kerosene (aka carbon neutral!!) and it worked!!! [link](https://news.klm.com/world-first-in-the-netherlands-by-klm-shell-and-dutch-ministry-for-infrastructure-and-water-management-first-passenger-flight-performed-with-sustainable-synthetic-kerosene/)
-Shell has it own electric scooter! [link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210216006045/en/Lotus-International-Company-Partners-With-Shell-to-Extend-Its-Brand-Into-E-Mobility-With-the-New-Shell-RIDE-E-Scooter)
-Shell opens first hydrogen refuelling station of H2Benelux in Amsterdam [link](https://www.waterstofnet.eu/nl/nieuws/shell-opens-first-hydrogen-refuelling-station-of-h2benelux-in-amsterdam)
... and the list goes on

Important note about the ticker:
You can trade the stock at AEX (Amsterdam), GBX (London) and NYSE. There are two types of shares, A and B. Each type has its own tax regime (only for the dividend) so you need to do your own research to  see which regime is the most beneficial for you. This might be quite complicated but in the end it has a small impact so you shouldn‚Äôt worry about the difference if you‚Äôre not planning to buy a lot of shares.

TLDR:
Oil and gas prices are at a 12 month high -> stock goes up
Shell is more than an oil company, they will lead us to a green future.",2021-02-17 10:49:55

We are talking synthetic meat. Lab grown bovine. Chicken of the lab. There‚Äôs tons of companies out there that are getting into it. 
I‚Äôve yet to really see any public and I‚Äôm hoping we can all figure out some good plays. 

Mosa meat- not currently public. Probably very close to it though. They where taking private investments and then stopped. I‚Äôm wondering when they plan on going public. 

Memphismeats.com
Product testing stage. They have products but nothing for public consumption. They are us based. Still no investors but they have reports of thousands of investors who want to part of their company. Tyson holds a major stake in this company. TSN may be a play here as well, until Memphis ipos. They are building a pilot plant to start to scale production. 

Eatjust. California based company. Some products. They will be pushing products soon. They do plan on being in Singapore restaurants soon

Aleph farms is another. They state the current cost for 1 steak is about 50 to produce it. It will eventually go down. 


I‚Äôll be honest. This post is prob 3-4 years to early. But we gotta get this on our radars now. The sooner we can get into these future companies the better. There are more than 60 companies working on this right now. With companies shooting for net zero by 2050 we are getting close to this being a future top contender. It solves problems with food production on another planet or space in general. It would transform our farming methods. 

Tyson and cargill are saying within 3 years to have it on shelves. 

Richard Branson and Bill gates are investing heavy in this. They see this as the future of how we will eat. If people aren‚Äôt vegetarians then they will be eating this. It will be considerably more than regular meat early on, by 2-3 times. But within 10 years it should be cheaper. 
It looks like Memphis meats will be their play. 

Singapore is very progressive with this. They will be the first to launch it and have products for consumption. Keep an eye out in their market. 

Tldr:  TSN  may be the play for the early on investing of lab meat. Raise your awareness and keep your eyes peeled. I plan on slapping this meat on Mars.",2021-02-17 10:47:42

Porch is a one stop shop for all homeowners. Why does that matter? Because buying a home is stressful. I know you fucks spend your time drinking piss in your parents basement so you wouldn‚Äôt understand, but after your GME and weed stocks finally fucking print you‚Äôll be buying a house and you‚Äôll need help getting it setup.

When I look at companies to invest in, I look at three key points. Management team, financials and market cap. I only invest in companies that can ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù blow the fuck up. üöÄ üöÄ I‚Äôll break it down into sections.

Management team:
Honestly I‚Äôll just link [it](https://porchgroup.com/team), because its extensive. One thing to take note is the amount of very experienced vps that lead all the subsidiaries. I also really like the CFO and the CEO looks like a major nerd which is a plus. 

Financials: 
I‚Äôm still new to financials, but I spent my day off as a male prostitute to study $PRCH‚Äôs. One thing to note is they have little to no debt, they have negative income from 2019-2020 but that was purely because they acquired Elite Insurance and some sort of Real estate company. It‚Äôs clear they are expanding. 

Also, they have a 36.9% short float. Why in the fuck is this important? Because it‚Äôs an up trending stock. (+22% last week +69% last month) and uptrending stocks with a significant short float causes squeezes, [explanation](https://stockstotrade.com/short-float/)

Market cap: 
I‚Äôve done absolutely no research as to if this has any effect but it‚Äôs something I always look at when buying stocks in a new sector. Look at the market cap of its competitors. 

Zillow- 27b and 36b
Porchgroup- 1.72 billion 

So yea there is room for growth. It seems fucked but it‚Äôs worked for me in the past so fuck you.

Green Uranium....yes.,641,llh9mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llh9mq/green_uraniumyes/,299,1613549032.0,"*****As always Do Your Research, this is not financial advise*****

We have a polar vortex affecting over 1 million square miles in the USA as of this week alone.

We also have a situation where energy demand is unable to be met with energy supply. Texas is a case in opportunity meets an urgent need. Texas depend on natural gas, oil and wind energy to provide power for millions of households. But what happens when the distribution network is unable to cope with demand for energy? We get rolling blackouts and a power grid that cannot sustain itself for prolonged periods of time.

We would need a stable and reliable energy source that can exist even during massive power spike demands. Uranium. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20 terajoules of energy (2√ó1013 joules), assuming complete fission; as much energy as 1.5 million kilograms (1,500 tonnes) of coal. The highest energy density material is Uranium. Since nuclear power involves no combustion, there are no byproducts of combustion to pollute the atmosphere.

Nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source. It generates power through fission, which is the process of splitting uranium atoms to produce energy. The heat released by fission is used to create steam that spins a turbine to generate electricity without the harmful byproducts emitted by fossil fuels.

So what is the play? No not utilities. The miners. We already have several examples.

***But what‚Äôs also under valued? DNN.***

Denison Mines Corp. operates as a uranium exploration and development company in Canada. With over 1 billion in Market Cap. The company's Athabasca Basin exploration portfolio consists of numerous projects covering approximately 310,000 hectares. The current consensus among 7 polled investment analysts is to Buy stock in Denison Mines Corp. This rating has held steady since January, when it was unchanged from a Buy rating.

The all-time high Denison Mine Corp stock closing price was 27.03 on December 06, 2006. This frames how much value has been lost in years.

Financials have actually improved since 2018. And may actually come up with a profit this upcoming year.

The fact that the US energy sector is now prioritizing efficient green energy may be the biggest opportunity in decades when it comes to energy.

EDIT 1* 

Twenty nine states have at least one commercial nuclear reactor

Most U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors are located east of the Mississippi River. Illinois has more reactors than any state (11 reactors at 6 plants), and at the end of 2019, it had the largest total nuclear net summer electricity generation capacity at about 11,582 megawatts (MW). The Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Mississippi, has the largest U.S. nuclear reactor with an electricity generating capacity of about 1,400 MW. The two smallest operating reactors, each with a net summer generating capacity of about 520 MW, are at the Prairie Island nuclear plant in Red Wing, Minnesota. Two new nuclear reactors are under construction in Georgia, each with a planned electricity generation capacity of about 1,100 MW.

EDIT 2**

As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply.
- The U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, accounting for more than 30% of worldwide nuclear generation of electricity,

- Some 98 nuclear power plants in the U.S. remain in operation, although a few more are scheduled for retirement on the grounds of economics because of low-priced natural gas, but two new reactors are being completed in Georgia, and are on schedule and on budget,

- Following a 30-year period in which few new reactors were built in the U.S., it is expected that two more new units will come online soon after 2020; others resulting from 16 license applications made since mid-2007 are proposing to build 24 new nuclear reactors, most of which are of the new small modular reactor (SMR) designs,

- The first zero-emission credit programs have commenced, in New York, Illinois, and other states.

In predicting future energy needs, it‚Äôs important to know just how little U is needed to produce power in a nuclear reactor. A single U fuel pellet the size of a fingertip contains as much energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal or 149 gallons of oil.

Each year, the United States consumes about

- 25,000 tons of U in generating 20% of our electricity,

- 624,000,000 tons of natural gas in generating 34% of our electricity,

- 750,000,000 tons of coal in generating 30% of our electricity,

- 1,000,000,000 tons of petroleum (7,200,000,000 barrels) to fuel our transportation sector, which contains the energy equivalent of 1,500,000,000 tons of coal.

EDIT3**********

Turns out DNN is also 15% owned by a Korean utility/ which is majority owned by the Korean government, ""known as KEPCO or Hanjeon, is the largest electric utility in South Korea, responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the development of electric power projects including those in nuclear power, wind power and coal. KEPCO is responsible for 93% of Korea's electricity generation. The South Korean government (directly and indirectly) owns a 51.11% share of KEPCO. 


KEPCO's involvement in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering of the nuclear power plant to nuclear fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Construction of KEPCO nuclear power plants is undertaken by major Korean construction companies, while the manufacture of key elements of a nuclear power plant is done by companies including Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction and Westinghouse Electric Company.

In October 2020 KEPCO signed a memorandum of understanding with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering to develop a floating nuclear power plant based on the BANDI-60 60 MWe small modular reactor, which has been under development since 2016. ""

***EDIT 4***
""Advanced Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are a key part of the Department‚Äôs goal to develop safe, clean, and affordable nuclear power options. The advanced SMRs currently under development in the United States represent a variety of sizes, technology options, capabilities, and deployment scenarios. These advanced reactors, envisioned to vary in size from tens of megawatts up to hundreds of megawatts, can be used for power generation, process heat, desalination, or other industrial uses. SMR designs may employ light water as a coolant or other non-light water coolants such as a gas, liquid metal, or molten salt.

Advanced SMRs offer many advantages, such as relatively small physical footprints, reduced capital investment, ability to be sited in locations not possible for larger nuclear plants, and provisions for incremental power additions. SMRs also offer distinct safeguards, security and nonproliferation advantages.""

CAT - Caterpillar - Looking for Feedback,17,llgk0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llgk0r/cat_caterpillar_looking_for_feedback/,32,1613546779.0,"Hey Fellow Retards,

I've been doing a lot of technical analysis lately and trying to learn more from some investing sites and books. Mostly I'm focusing on reading charts. I've been investing for over 10 years now, but mostly on and off in terms of how involved I've been. Some years I'm a lot more active in picking stocks, others I've been passive and just in ETFs.

Recently, CAT (Caterpillar construction equipment) has been in a lot of news posts and talked about a lot on twitter and reddit and shit. They are at an all time high right now, and what looks to be a cup and handle formation that they just broke out of today.

I started a website in the last few weeks that analyses stocks on a daily basis to break down what is happening in the stock chart. So any feedback would be welcome from you guys in terms of what you think about the analysis and if you agree with what I am seeing. The actual post for CAT is here: [https://stocktavern.com/stock-of-the-day-2-16-2021-cat-cup-and-handle/](https://stocktavern.com/stock-of-the-day-2-16-2021-cat-cup-and-handle/) if you want to go to the site, otherwise I'll lay out the basics here:

&#x200B;

The stock chart is shown here, and I've added some markings to help.

https://preview.redd.it/8r3fd02yaxh61.jpg?width=1464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56a1726f1fdc5383d378a05f75fdf79511a66fd1

Essentially, a cup and handle formed up to Friday Feb 12, as shown in the picture. The previous high point of the stock was at $200.17. Based on William O'Neil's books and strategies, this would put the buy point at $200.27. In the actually post I linked, I go into more specifics and the actual strengths and weaknesses of the formation it created.

Looks like today the stock actually broke out right passed the buy point and closed today at  $202.38. At the time of this post it is $203.78 in after-hours trading.

I think since it was able to break out of the buy point (and on greater than average daily volume), it is a really good sign for the share price.

Would like to hear what everyone else here thinks about the situation and CAT in general.",2021-02-17 09:26:19

Since the most recent mod shakeup, the entire team has been petitioning to bring zjz back. We wanted to keep you in the loop, but couldn't, because it might have hurt our chances of getting zjz back. We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

When you look at [inflation data](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/), inflation runs in highest in 2008 and 2011 when these commodities spiked. If the Federal Reserve targets inflation at 2% and we see a repeat of +3.5% in 2011 and +4-5% such as in 2008, then how does the Federal Reserve not raise rates?

On top of that, [Lumber](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price) is at 52 week high, really in uncharted territory, almost double its historic price. This is undoubtedly impacting non-food consumer goods across the board.

Some of these prices are driven by weather, but some geo-political. Swine flu is dying down in China driving soybean prices up due to larger hog herd, Russia (#3 producer) is restricting wheat exports, Argentina (#4 producer) suspending corn exports due to drought. Byproducts of these commodities such as beef, pork, poultry and dairy will likely raise significantly as costs go up.

On top of this we are seeing a $15 dollar minimum wage push in the U.S. that will undoubtedly hit he bottom line for food prices as manual labor benefits. Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa should be confirmed as agricultural secretary is a huge bull on ethanol which should continue to rise corn prices.

Energy wise, a rebound from covid should drive up oil demand along with the administrations policies on restricting additional exploration, drilling and pipelines.

This comes to the question - why are forecasters predicting inflation below 2% irregardless of the documented indicators above? Will all these commodities across the board spiking to 52 week highs, with some highs not seen since 2011, not drive inflation much higher? What will be the Federal Reserve's response? What kind of impact will we see on the market, particularly individual sectors?",2021-02-17 09:24:14

As you can see it's oversold on the RSI. And PLTR actually ended up beating estimates. ~~It was incorrectly reported that PLTR came up short.~~

Estimated EPS: $0.02

~~Incorrectly reported EPS:~~ -$0.08

~~Actual EPS:~~ $0.06

Edit: I'm dumb - one is GAAP EPS, one is non-GAAP EPS.

Today we closed at 110 which could be a near term top.  Recent upgrades from Morgan Stanley and others are point towards $125, but as long as mall traffic comes back post covid there's no reason SPG can't hit $150 or more given the market's valuations.

If you look at the chart it's been going up $20 at a time and then giving up half the gains like clockwork.  I expect we may get one more cycle of this before we get to the new price targets in the $125 range.

I've been holding April $105 calls and today I decided to sell March $110s against them to play the potential downside, and to be theta gang during the time this downturn takes.  Given the momentum we may just power higher, but with RSI pushing 80 its hard to see that happening without another outside catalyst of some kind.

Part of the reason I sold those calls was to raise cash to buy more silver plays

I'm still in SPG and SENS, but mostly I've been trying to post updated DD on silver and am having a lot of issues.  This post is primarily meant to see if I'm allowed to post on WSB.

Not because I got locally famous or anything but because I‚Äôve started to bald and am in hiding until borders open up and I can either go to Turkey or Mexico for a hairline transplant. Geopolitical situation willing, I will have a Norwood type 1 hairline again. Only problem? You‚Äôve gotta pay for the quality hairline you want. SO, your boy decided to go big again. 


Another Canadian play. Another solid gold play. One to hold and enjoy the divvies but also feeling safe that you‚Äôre in at price levels that existed before we wasted our time in the Middle East.


 That play? Suncor. TSE: SU, NYSE: SU


You may be thinking, wow this is some slow ass dino-stock that I can‚Äôt meme on. However, fatty gains are pretty much guaranteed.


Why?


1.	Everyone (see: moron analysts) thinks that oil is dead. These fuckers sit around in their downtown condos, wearing Patagonia sweater vests and thinking that just because they don‚Äôt drive their compact german executive car as often to mom‚Äôs house, that no one is driving at all. Take a look at the suburbs you hedgie-tard, take a look at ASEAN, Asia, Africa etc. People are going to driving their cars (we‚Äôve sold 60 mil+ a year for years, almost all of those are gasoline powered). No one in these meme times can afford a Tesla or a BYD shit box unless you made money on gamestop. Yea I made 100% flipping gamestop in a day, hold my bags. China lays 8000km of highway a year, you‚Äôre not going to power that kind of growth with a fucking battery pack Elon.


2.	The Russian vaccine cannot be underestimated. It‚Äôs 91% effective for normal cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate cases according to a study from the Lancet. Russia now has this vaccine produced in South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan etc. Only rich western countries can afford extended lockdowns, Russia has just liberated the developing worlds economies with a 10$ vaccine that can be stored in a fridge. For all intents and purposes, this pandemic is done. Russia has forced the hand of western supply chains if they want to make money. 


3.	Suncor has entered into agreements with Canadian government bodies to retrofit stations with EV charging ports. Suncor has >1800 stations in Canada. If they have to , they can easily pivot their stations into EV charging locations and with consumer presence of mind, everyone knows where their local petro Canada station is. Highly pivotable operations. Why would they let some eco-nerds start an EV charging chain on their soil? 


4.	There's nothing proprietary or mind blowing about EV charging companies, once the big boy gas companies step in, they're just going to install it in the stations that are already there.


5.	Good balance sheet, Warren buffet has been invested for a long time. But he bought the dip and recently sold his the shares he bought in 2020. He still has >13m shares, FMR bought about $500 million worth of Suncor in the last quarter. Strong free cash flow through gas stations (one place you can still go during the entire pandemic without masks, gloves or any requirements, been open for business this whole time).


6.	They can maintain dividends at WTI $35 according to their report, if WTI stays >55 this is a no brainer. Currently the market is pricing in about $55 wti so once the market prices in $60, on a DCF that makes the company worth $45.8B Canadian. 


7.	Geopolitics. Biden isn‚Äôt cancelling new drilling permits just because ‚ÄúDUDE SAVE THE PLANET MAN‚Äù. America not wasting its hydrocarbon stores is smart in case of a protracted conflict in the Pacific with China. Why ship oil in from the Saudis and Venezuela when you have a shit ton of shale safe in Texas. America is rich enough to have countries deplete their own reserves for America‚Äôs consumption and Canada is happy to help. The Keystone pipeline oil will just get shipped down on trains owned by Berkshire and Bill Gates (yea gates owns like 14% of CN rail and is the largest shareholder of that rail company, the more you know lol). The TMX pipeline is full steam ahead and will be completed by dec 2022. This completition will help shrink the gap between WCS and WTI and allow Canada to sell its oil all around the world. Suncor has committed to fill these pipes with its juice too.


8.	Our X-Factor. [This guy](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FF2LGW7EAU5O5FUGMDLZKTFU4E.jpg) did a giant tour around India and ASEAN promoting Canadian business. What is Canadian business? Mostly natural resources and finance lol. We‚Äôre going to sell our Oil Sands through the port of BC to developing Asian nations around the world and help them gain energy independence from China. Canada standing by ready to help keep the free-world, free. You think this guy went around the pacific just for fun? 


9.	The last quarter showed great cost management and shows that Suncor is looking after shareholder interests. Shareholder interest in this sector are no  longer about growing production capacity but about delivering value to shareholder through dividends and buybacks. Management has already started buying back shares and its just a matter of time before they reinstate the dividend to .42 cents a share‚Ä¶.every quarter LOL


10.	Hedge against inflation. We‚Äôve printed a shit ton of dollars and now people want to tell me that a barrel of oil (148L of oil, equal to 20-30 gallons of gasoline and 10-20 gallons of diesel) should only cost $60 usd? $60 usd? I shit on $60. $60 wont even get a Saudi prince the paint on his tomahawk missles. Fuck off with this fake scam money, commodities serve a specified purpose and their value is derived from that. 


11.	Marko Kolanovic, a quant at JPM who LITERALLY called the bottom of the corona market dump says were entering a new oil ‚Äúsupercycle‚Äù. If someone that smart and connect says it, then you don‚Äôt even need to listen to me anymore. Suncor was trading at 40$ cad before this pandemic came around, and it will again.


For all you cr*pto-morons, here: SU-coin is a limited quantity e-coin that returns you .21 to .42 cents  a quarter and each day grows its proportional share of Canada‚Äôs second largest oil producer through management buying coins and destroying them. Wow so cool.

"What started as a short squeeze play has turned into long, SENSical play",54,llfxep,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llfxep/what_started_as_a_short_squeeze_play_has_turned/,51,1613544900.0,"Disclaimer: This is obviously **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**. I have  long positions <30 LEAPS, although i'm not diabetic, i'm familiar with CGM technology because I've been in the diabetes/CGM space for over 5 years. Lastly, not too long ago, this was a penny stock and despite its insane run up, expect extreme volatility if you decide to join the ride.

If you're a frequent flyer to the WSB short squeeze rocket, then you might have (of, for you smooth brains) heard of Senseonics (SENS). For those that are unfamiliar, there's been quite a bit of chatter in the last few weeks regarding this stock, so I wont reiterate on what's been said on any of the DD posts (just use the search bar if you're interested in the early posts).

Instead, what i want to focus on in my post is why I decided to go long on this stock and why i broke my personal rule of never investing at all-time highs:

**1) Technology is disruptive!**
I own DXCM (since 2015) and have owned TNDM (and full disclosure, i sold it last year) so i'm familiar with CGM and the diabetes care technology companies.  First thing's first, the current Eversense product is not ideal - implantation required every 90 days, not approved for children, calibration required, crappy app, no ability to share data, etc. So why am i bullish despite all these cons? Simple. This is the earliest iteration of Eversense which imo, already has Dexcom G6, and even the upcoming G7, (or any other CGM really but we'll stick to the G6/G7 comparison since they're best in class - again imo) beat in may respects. As far as CGM goes, I think these are the metrics that matter - 1) accuracy, 2) product life, 3) customer satisfaction and Eversense beats G6 in the first 2 metrics handily and 3, arguably. Eversense is very early in the product development stage and i think in 5 years, this will make meaningful updates/upgrades to address some of the early issues - even better accuracy, 365 day product life, smaller footprint, better integrations and apps, etc. I've seen this same story with Dexcom with its G4 back in 2015 so I'm making the same leap of faith that Senseonics can get this done within the next 5 years.

**2) Company has become an M&A target.**
One thing that gets lost in all this is that with the company having been able to find the funding/partnership that it so desperately needed, it can now focus on the product and its customers again. Now that the company doesnt have solvency to worry about in the very near future, what im half hoping, half expecting to happen now is that the company will be a target by one of the big players in the game. Dexcom just recently announced during the earnings call that they lauched their very own [venture fund] (https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/dexcom-launches-venture-fund-adjacent-businesses) and I remember them taking an interest in other diabetes companies before when they bought shares of TNDM at $4/share not that long ago. Again, the story seems eerily similar here so my conviction that this will be in the realm of possibility just got stronger than just a few weeks ago. This was already a strong buy in the last couple of weeks for me due to #1 but with the introduction of #2, I decided to buy even more even at ATH.

**3) LEAPS (2022 and 2023) just recently opened up**
Last week, the option plays for SENS only went to July. When i learned this week that they opened up 2022 and 2023 LEAPS, i snatched the $7 calls to see if my bet in #1 and #2 play out. This way, if there's a delay with the 180 FDA approval again, this buys me enough time to watch it play out without sweating it too much.

TL,DR: SENS has waved off bankruptcy, now its growth story looks similar to Dexcom back in 2015, and the potential of the Eversense CGM is superior to others in the space in many respects. Dexcom ventures just launched and will be a venture/strategic investor to many diabetes companies. Bought 1-2 year calls to watch my thesis play out.",2021-02-17 08:55:00

Today you might have fallen victim to a scheme unbeknownst to your smooth brains.

Hedge funds frequently use earnings to disguise attacks on the price. 
Ever wondered why stocks with good earnings seem to go down regardless, and everyone just blames it on ‚Äúmarket randomness‚Äù?

Well folks, it‚Äôs called compound interest.

They pull this bullshit on stocks using analysts (like shitron), the news, etc. But earnings is even better.
The whole point is that they know the stock is solid so they want a better entry point. What they do is they unload their shares just enough to fuel a sell-off and then get back in at a lower point.

Simple and effective. And you tards are left wondering what went wrong.

Nothing did, your stock is still solid. You just got played.
I‚Äôd be willing to bet that by next week or even end of this one the price will go right back up.
The whole thing was basically a green light for me to go in later this week, and I wouldn‚Äôt even have thought about Palatir before 


TLDR -
Chill out $palantards, the hedgies just pulled a prank on you.



EDIT: whoa calm down anti-conspiracy gang. Creating sell-offs for better entry points is STANDARD practice among hedge funds and has been done basically since hedge funds and markets exist.
It‚Äôs just more believable to do it on earnings or after CNBC thrashes a stock, rather than out of nowhere.",2021-02-17 08:48:49

Zomedica‚Äôs product portfolio will include **innovative** diagnostics and therapeutics that emphasize patient health and practice health. With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica‚Äôs mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.

¬†

# Investors

Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (US:ZOM) has 45 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of **54,381,501 shares**. Largest shareholders include Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc., **Vanguard Group Inc, VTSMX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares, BlackRock Inc.**, Millennium Management Llc, FSMAX - Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund, Geode Capital Management, Llc, Citadel Advisors Llc, Northern Trust Corp, and Winton Capital Group Ltd.

¬†

# Team

I checked their employees who are on LinkedIn, I can confirm they are all top notch workers. **Newly appointed CEO, Robert Cohen (former Pfizer exec) has taken three different biotech companies from $0.30 to $8.00/share.**

¬†

# What is Truforma

Zomedica's flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect & diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in \~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States. [Link](https://zomedica.com/truforma-2)

¬†

# Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

# News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

¬† When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

¬† Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

¬† As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

¬† The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

¬† By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

# Fucking Chapter II

Today Zomedica announced the closing of the $173.5M bought deal; the money will be used to accelerate the development of their diagnostic equipment.

In the last DD i talked only about Truforma and many thought it‚Äôs the only product Zomedica will be offering.... Hooooooold up, i have great news for you.

Truforma on launch will be able to detect only a few diseases, but right now Zomedica disclosed it has more than 50 additional patents in the works, as u/Faraday27 said a myriad of new assays being formulated. If they manage to toss in cancer screenings and more basic rapid diagnostics such that the machine is a one-stop diagnostic shop, then they'll be an incredibly valuable company.

 Zomedica has added a new section to their website specifically for TRUFORMA called ""TRUFORMA Resource Center"" where they have added full documentation of their product, I read them and damn that machine may be able to tell if my girlfriend is a bitch (or is it me?) .

  
 

[This is an old photo of their product pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/f9e9cze6gwh61.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=dba37481d2e48748d5beb8b08606b5237b262895)

As you can see Zomedica is just one of 8 products in the pipeline, their annual report is due in 10 days. This will give us a clear view of when to expect to see the new products. ZM-020 has a lot of potential right now, on Friday it came out that Zomedica filed a patent application for it, and apparently they hired the team that made the product in 2016 in the next image. Apparently testing this technology in a veterinary setting is the first step in bringing it to human use!

I want to respect your span of attention, so I'm going to keep it sweet and short. TL;DR at the bottom.

WSB has been flooded by $GME posts (rightfully) and Mia Khalifa tweets (please don't do that), so many of you probably missed the potential of $NOK and the good number of DDs that have been postes. So let me remind you in a nutshell:

1. **Space Travel üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  
Yes, $NOK is litterally going to the moon to fix the Wi Fi there, so that (real) astronauts and space tourists can browse [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) at the speed of light.  
So why pour money on loss-making and extremely expensive stock of space exploration companies and not on $NOK? Spolier: no reason  
[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)
2. **Relevance of the infrastructure business**  
$NOK is not a phone company. It is the **third** largest telecom-equipment manufacturer after Cisco and Huawei (yes, you heard that right. Just go to Wikipedia if you don't trust me).  
They just landed a juicy contract from Deutsche Telekom:

3. **Value of shares outstanding**  
Someone once posted ""ThEy HaVe 5 BiLliOn ShAreS FloAt hurr durr, the price is never going to move"". And the sheeps started copying/pasting this bulls\*\*t all over WSB. Please look at the **value** of the shares outstanding ($23B) and compare with, for example Palantir ($37B). Also, look at the huge condom-shaped spike during the meme frenzy. Are you sure the price is not going to move? Spoiler: the price is going to move very well.
4. **Consumer business in INDIA**  
This deserves many **üöÄüöÄüöÄ.** Nokia is building and selling air conditioners in India. Do you know what is one of the most popolous countries in the world? Yes, India. Do you know a country in which the middle class is about to 10x? Yes, India.  
This is their first step, I expect many more in the same direction.

5. **Short interest**  
I know you apes will love this. $NOK is still one of the most shorted stocks in the NYSE. But look carefully: A) short interest ios dropping sharply and B) the price is has never been lower in the last 5 years (excluding March Corona crash).  
This means shorts are covering because they know there is no more downside potential. Let's not give them the easy way out.

If it wasn't, people would just get rich by waiting for the days where lockups expire on publicly traded companies and make boatloads of money.

The fact that PLTR is less institutionally owned than most of its competitors means that this lockup period expiration is a great opportunity for the big guys to jump in.

UNCERTAINTLY drives DOWN stock price. My DD is simple. Without the uncertainty of exactly how many people will cash out their shares on Friday - the stock will rise like crazy.

Today is the best day to jump into PLTR. You have a healthy dip followed by very low IV (after earnings) meaning options are CHEAP AS FUCK. March $31 calls look especially juicy.

Due to all the hype around GME, AMC, NOK, etc, there has been little attention for the now-public company: Butterfly Network. üìà üöÄ (i hope mods don't take this down since this **isn't a SPAC anymore**)

# Intro to BFLY

Butterfly Network is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging. They specifically work with Ultrasound Technology. Their plan is to continue creating ultrasounds that are affordable, have ease-of-use, and have mobility, all while meeting the needs of medical professionals and patients. üöÄ **Butterfly is also backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation** along with Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, and **Cathie Wood from ARK Investment** Management LLC just to name a few investors üöÄ.

The market for medical imaging is also HUGE! In fact, 2/3 of the world has no access to medical imaging as well 2/3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be solved/addressed by simple imaging. This may be one of the reasons why Butterfly has attracted investments from the Bill & Malinda Gates Foundation. However, Butterfly only has its products being sold in North America and Europe for the time being. Butterfly also plans to expand its amount of products to further increase revenue in the future. [Official Butterfly Investors Presentation](https://manual.butterflynetwork.com/Butterfly+Network+JPM.pdf) (Heavily recommend looking at this quick pres.)

Longview Acquisition was a Blank Check Company that focused on merging with private companies to bring them to the market and was the company to bring BFLY onto the market. LGVW also estimates to have $589 million in gross proceeds for Butterfly Network, which includes the $414 million in cash held by Longview. üìà üöÄ üöÄ (rockets to keep your attention)

# Now on the Market

Butterfly Network & Longview Acquisition have now merged through a SPAC deal and came onto the market on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021 (Which is today at the time of writing). On Friday (Feb. 12, 2021) there was a shareholders meeting to announce the results of a stockholders' vote which had been occurring for the past month. Since BFLY is now trading in the market, the shareholder obviously approved it, not to mention a near 100% shareholder approval for the vote. -  [PR Newswire- BFLY Article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/longview-acquisition-corp-stockholders-approve-business-combination-with-butterfly-network-inc-301227602.html)

[First Day of Trading](https://preview.redd.it/nfzz5i0o1wh61.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3f376fe163f98b3bb07b5819acf81160dfd89ff)

As seen in the image above, BFLY is currently trading around 22-23 dollars which is a slight drop from its premerger price of 23.05. Butterfly Network's merger is valued at 1.5 Billion dollars and as you see the current market cap is around 1B, this means it is somewhat undervalued as it's supposed to be 1.5 Billion. Although it isn't significantly undervalued, every bit of value counts and is also a bonus. [Investor Place- Things to know about Butterfly Merger](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/lgvw-stock-15-things-to-know-about-longview-capital-and-the-butterfly-spac-merger/#:~:text=Butterfly%20Network%20is%20a%20medical,and%20several%20other%20European%20countries).

If you've been investing during 2020, you might have noticed that SPACs and IPOs have been on fire, with Airbnb (ABNB) recently coming to the market with over DOUBLE its valuation due to the hype. I predict this same effect can happen to Butterfly Network. üìà üöÄ

Micron currently has a 33 PE and showing a $2.65 EPS with a $87.75 price. It's currently early in a chip upcycle that looks to last until mid to late 2022. 

Analyst are pretty spread on what MU EPS will be but best I can figure a reasonable estimate is a $4.00 EPS for 2021. If the PE of 33 holds that's a $130+ stock priceüí∏üí∏üí∏.

MU won't hold a 33 PE near the end of the upcycle, but I suspect it tops at a 1 quarter EPS of $2+. 

Due to cyclical nature I use a 70% of peak EPS x mid cycle PE(33).  So if I extopolate out $2.00 EPS x 4 = $8 full year x 33 = $264 x 0.70 = $184 per share upper estimate.

They will be releasing q4 numbers this Wednesday after close. Since, analysts on WS were predicting about $26ish (prediction from 10-28-21) a barrel for q4 we are likely in for a beat.

I dont know if y'all have heard but Texas is fucked right now cause of the power grid. ERCOT power prices have gone to $9k for the better part of the last 2 days. NRG (Reliant Energy) is the largest retail power supplier in the Texas (I think). Just gonna do some quick maths on hypothetical numbers for NRG power supply: They prolly need 25 Gigawatts/Hour for their clients right now. They had to pay $3k-9k per MW/HR, Chemistry conversion of Mega to Giga = 1000, so NRG is paying 6,000,000 \* 25 = $150M per hour to supply Texas right now. They probably hedged some of this and I think they also generate some power, but still, I don't think they hedged enough for this type of event.

$ABEV, Latin America + Canada subsidiary of AB InBev, is near an all-time low valuation currently.  Given the firm's HQ is in Sao Paulo, this makes sense.  The coronavirus is so bad in Brazil rn that hospitals are consistently running out of oxygen and are turning sick people away from their ER's unless they are literally on the brink of death... But this shitshow won't last forever (right?).

$ABEV has reported consistent net profits over the past several years and quarters.  The latest dip came as coronavirus cases ramped up in Brazil.  With the progress made on vaccine development and global distribution, I like the potential for this stock to rebound... a lot.  Did I mention this is the 3rd largest company by market cap in the southern hemisphere?  It also doesn't hurt having InBev as your daddy.  ABEV distributes brands like: corona, Budweiser, Modelo, Presidente, Pepsi, Gatorade, Lipton, and an assortment of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  I'm in it for the calls.

A look at Dr. Michael Burry from The Big Short Scion Asset Management 13F which was filed just now.,120,ll90ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll90ay/a_look_at_dr_michael_burry_from_the_big_short/,98,1613525742.0,"There is a lot to take in when looking at the portfolio of a genius contrarian value investor like Dr Burry. I have heard that a back-test of a model of investment based on his 13F filings would return about 65% annually. Don't quote me on that since I didn't do the test myself. 

I am going to focus on **his new positions**:

There is a lot of reasons not to sell something you already own but there is only one reason to buy something new; that is you are bullish. 

**Sector Analysis:**

Sector analysis of his portfolio shows that three of his new positions are in energy, three in finance, and three in consumer staples. 

\> The finance ones are mega caps: he is using these to get a baseline for his portfolio. Every portfolio needs some mega caps to smooth out the fluctuations. Financial companies saw a huge rally in January and I suspect these positions from Dec 2020 were in anticipation of January rally. I bought a lot of finance stocks at the same time. I've sold out already since easy gains were in January. 

\> Consumer staples were hot during covid lockdown. I think since those positions are from Dec 2020 that's why they are showing up on 13F. One of these was a call option which may point at the fact that it was a temporary position. 

\>Energy is the interesting part of his new positions. With oil rebounding the chatter on the street is that it offers great risk adjusted returns. Less oil will be burned for electricity production (some countries still do that). This will lift the whole Energy sector. We are seeing problems with the electricity grid which has no excess capacity. This is an Economy Reopening trade. With industrial production increasing demand for energy will increase and prices for industrial electricity will as well. The reason for this is majority of residential electricity costs are fix through government negotiated contracts and most the price fluctuation is channeled to the industrial sector. The fact that a lot of hedge funds are currently adding energy to their portfolio I expect this sector to outperform. 

**Deeper look:** 

Based on the sector analysis above and some other factors I decided to add two Energy positions to my portfolio. From the three energy companies he added, I Eliminated HollyFrontier due to negative sentiment on the street. 

**I added Now Inc and SunCoke.** I will focus the rest of my DD on Now Inc.

A look at **Now Inc:**

Valuation: Good

Financial Health: Good

Price momentum: Good

Sentiment: Good

What does it do? distributes downstream energy and industrial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, LNG terminals, power generation, utilities, and industrial manufacturing operations.

Foreseeable News? Earnings call Feb 17th. 

What has been happening? Improving profit margins up until 2020. Current topline pressure. 

Bullish Catalysts? Increasing digitization and new skews added. Increase in Oil prices and investment.  

Safety Net? Zero Debt. Trading close to book value. 

**Disclaimer: This is my first take at the 13F, hence, some of the info above may be inaccurate. The timeline of this thesis is long-term hold. Small part of my portfolio 2 min after 13F was published. SunCoke is too small for me to publish a DD on. Also note worthy is that he Completely sold out of Game Stop.**

There are many small cap companies and a larger one (CCJ) with 6B cap. Obviously, they have been going up quite a lot in the past two or three months.

I think if Biden is serious about decarbonization, nuclear energy is a must as solar/wind have trouble keeping the lights on when there's no sun/wind. Battery sure can help but at this stage, cars will starve the supply for energy storage as cars offer more bangs for the bucks for the battery manufacturers. The power outage over the past few days in TX for sure highlighted the need for some back up for wind/solar.

TBH, I haven't done extensive DD but just thinking about maybe there's a macro trend here. The charts look good and seem to be setting up a big wave after years of consolidation.

PS. I have roof top solar and a battery for a little more than a year (both bought from TSLA using the TSLA money I made, feels great back then, not so now as I ""loss"" a few hundred k because of this). My home was self-powered 52% during this time with solar generation in the day and battery supply during night. Sure I can put more panels and batteries to get this % higher but the marginal cost will increase sharply. At some point it gets stupidly costly. I think this is the same for the whole power grid. 100% renewable even with battery storage is just not good investment and having some more stable generation to pick up the slack in unfavorable weather will help out a lot.

While \~5% isn't a big dip (put on your big boy pants - It's really not), if you're like me and hold calls you're absolutely feeling the pain.

\#1 - We were optimistic that $BB had decoupled from the meme stocks, but it's unclear that that's fully the case. [Algorithmic / high-frequency trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0oof/part_4_bb_no_meems_plus_gme_amc_nok_ties_that_bind/) can exacerbate sell-offs of particular baskets (and vice versa). Taken separately, one can see reasons for a dip for certain meme tickers but as of this writing every single WSB ticker of recent memory (NOK, AMC, GME, etc.) is down against a broader index that is green

\#2 - Oddly, the cynical here tend to be the naive. Do not succumb to the tin foil-itis. Short ladders generally don't exist. Hedge funds like to make money when stocks go up (or down) - They are not a monolith. The harsh truth is - The market is brutal and indifferent. Nobody's out to get you, because nobody cares. You make money or lose money by the dint of your ability and luck. And don't forget the luck.

\#3 - Newbie investors keep asking ""what to do"". If you are an investor rather than a trader (and there is a BIG difference) - There is only one question that matters, period. It's the question that should have driven your thinking about the stock when you bought it and when you decide to sell, and it's the question you should have in mind when you read the [news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-jarvis-named-best-breed-160000731.html).

# How do you feel about the fundamental growth prospects of $BB as a company, and [the price of the stock relative to those prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)?

Make your own decisions. There's a reason why [u/Deepfuckingvalues](https://www.reddit.com/u/Deepfuckingvalues/) is a legend and profited accordingly - It takes real guts and conviction. And sometimes you still get kicked in the balls.

Good - RAVI seems to work, and just like I told you it would (screenshots below)

Bad - Etoro (my brokerage) had an outage right on market open (screenshot with proof below), which made me miss almost every single trade, except one. This means I will have to live-test it tomorrow.

[Third and final example. Here, there is a small volume spike, so we don't have to ignore it. In this example we have 5 succesful trades, 1 mistake and 1 case of breaking even. ](https://preview.redd.it/bt3oiji7fvh61.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea8d5b56052275e9a440835481331d6d46bdbd8e)

Lets say only rich country with cold climate will use pfizer vaccine

US&Canada = 365 M

Japan = 126 M

Europe =  741 M

Total = 1232 M, dose to have fully vaccinated is 2 times, price per dose $20.

Total revenue pfizer just from vaccine = 49 Billion, just from vaccine alone and last year revenue was  41 Billion

&#x200B;

At December 2020, they say they will produce 1Billion+ dose vaccine

[https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/14/us/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-vaccine/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/14/us/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-vaccine/index.html)

And at january, they  increasing its 2021 production goal from 1.3 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to 2 billion.

With that fact in mind its safe to assume that every quarter they will produce 500 Milion dose vaccine, and their revenue quarterly will add 10 Billion just from vaccine alone. their Q4 is about  11 Billion, with that number pfizer revenue for Q1 might be around 21 Billion, which is doubling their revenue from Q4 2020, and will continue to raise as long their vaccine still needed

"Rapper George Watsky of ""Pale Kid Raps Fast"" fame is a low-key stock market prophet and the song ""Bet Against Me"" predicts a crash",0,ll8543,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll8543/rapper_george_watsky_of_pale_kid_raps_fast_fame/,10,1613523470.0,"[Watsky - Bet Against Me](https://youtu.be/NNRGTmu5Sok)

Much like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" was written by some rock and roll dudes who were low key really well versed in theology and history, from the perspective of the devil crafting an introductory message from himself to the listener, ""Bet Against Me"" was written from the perspective of Standard & Poor's, or S&P 500 bulls in general, in a message toward bears.

Here's an examination of all the lyrics line by line proving it:

> You will if you didn't feel it before.

The gapening can always get worse if any bears aren't worried about butthole blood levels yet. 

> Ever since I was a kid, never really been bored.

The S&P 500 has always found new catalysts for price increases ever since it was created.

> Swinging from building to building with my umbilical cord

The people who created these index funds carefully manage the price by doing things like secretly trading back and forth between each other's firms at pre-organized pricing patterns.

> But they don't know what I've really endured 

Even the creators of SPY are out of touch with how increasingly complicated the market's situation is.

> They say Godzilla been summoned, but we're not running, Atilla the Hun is coming, we killing his horde 

This is a double entendre, as bulls in general see themselves as fighting off a horde with war cries like ""HOLD THE LINE,"" but the creators of these indexes also hear that the retail traders making money on their trades are the biggest threat to them and so they call WSB traders a ""horde"" and focus on defeating us. Very clever dual sided coin type statement. 

> Spillin my innards, I fell on my sword

Another clever line with multiple meanings. In a meta narrative Watsky is referring to himself as the lyricist here risking his life by subtly revealing his prophetic insights in these lyrics. In the narrative of the song's message from the S&P to bears, this continues from the last line about fighting the ""horde,"" where it refers to how bulls in general sometimes fall on their swords and lose money ""HOLD THE LINE""ing through crashes, and how the controllers of the stock market narcissistically see themselves as falling on their swords by nobly allowing retail investors to trade commission free instead of letting the market run out of liquidity and collapse. 

> And now my blood is spilling out from the ceiling to floor

> I'm swimmin through it, I'm swallowing fluid

> Knew I had to do it, so I grew like a million gills

> Cause evolution is kill or be killed

This continues both Watsky's meta narrative about himself as the lyricist and the primary narrative of the song regarding bulls vs bears, but I'm going to focus on translating the primary narrative in this post. 

Bulls who have lost money are forced to dive fully into gambling addiction and find ways to avoid getting crushed by debt. Fund managers as well have been forced to find creative new ways to keep money flowing into their own hands in a market full of retail investors who outnumber them.

> Your Mrs. isn't equipped to be having kids, ever listen to what I'm spitting? It's like sniffing fertility pills 

People will cum a lot when SPY hits $420.69

> This illegitimate village idiot bridging original shit with digital 

> Catching a carrier pigeon, sticking a chip in his wing and hitching a ride

Especially after the 08 crisis, major firms like Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Lloyd's, JP Morgan, etc. are viewed by educated people as illegitimate and seen as village idiots of world economic history. But right now all the market puppet masters feel very smart for how they've taken advantage of digitization in the modern era, leading to the modern era where the over the air communication device of the time (carrier pigeon -> chip in wing -> internet -> smartphone) can have its popularity hijacked and used for the benefit of stonks via apps like Robinhood.

> But there's a glitch in the system inside

Robinhood is buggy as fuck. And that's barely scratching the surface of what this line means.

> Got this ambition, I'm keeping the precious fish in my kitchen

> I catch em quick when I get em to bite (right?)

They have captured the ambitions of all the entrepreneurially-minded people trapped in a casino inside a Wendy's. Any money they make betting on stonks going up can be taken back from them by getting them to yolo on a juicy looking pump and dump. 

> This kind of killer can fill a pelican bill 

> And my delicatessen will keep my recipe tight 

This system continues being effective enough to keep those at the top in power and the tendies they promise to traders will keep the recipe for success working for them, in the eyes of fund managers. 

> You kinda Gollumy, go ahead try to follow me

> But if you're solid we build a colony, bruh

> Calling Me Maybe, they popping molly

> These babies are sniffling like they're chuggin' some quality ph√≥

Idk I can't decipher this line. There's a couple references to other music from around when this song came out so maybe if I deciphered the meaning of this song when it first came out this would have been fresh enough to understand but I'm mad late finally catching onto this now 

> > Sample:

> > ""I'm playing with the house's money now,     
'Cause I thought we were on our way out during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
I was, ah, in my late teens‚Äî     
I fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment,     
Crash through the ceiling, and that was gonna be the end of everything.     
And I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and I was still alive""

Pretty self-explanitory I think, lil metaphorical sample use 

> Bet against me. Bet against me.

> If you wanna lose your home... bet against me.

> And every penny you own... bet against me.

> If you wanna eat your words... bet against me.

> Want your feelings hurt? Bet against me.

> You want your ego bruised? Bet against me.

> If you like to lose, bet against me. 

> If you love regret, bet against me. 

> You wanna die in debt, bet against me. 

> If you wanna shed tears, bet against me.

> You wanna lose ten years, bet against me. 

> Got too much wealth, bet against me.

> If you fucking hate yourself, bet against me! 

Again, pretty self-explanitory. 

Now, since he's a poetry snob he did leave this all open for interpretation. You could take it as a legit bull anthem designed to pump everyone up about the market. But I think it's pretty clearly an insight into how this dystopic nightmare is overextending itself and the vocal performance and music video seem to back that up. 

This confirms my belief that SPY will crash the mother of all crashes shortly after reaching $420.69

The Case for Cloudflare's Continued Growth,22,ll7zo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7zo1/the_case_for_cloudflares_continued_growth/,20,1613523048.0,"# Why Cloudflare Is Positioned for Continued Strong Growth

The largest growth opportunity I see for Cloudflare within the next year  is  with Cloudflare One and Cloudflare for Teams offerings, as it really   fits a distributed workforce better than traditional VPN offerings.  The  pandemic has highlighed this issue for many companies, and I expect  to  see a lot of companies moving to modern offerings like this instead  of  relying on firewall appliances.

The second largest growth opportunity that I see potentially in the next   five years is the increased adoption of edge computing. Many established   companies are still getting into containerization and serverless   architecture. However, I expect to see a large increase in edge   computing being used for new platforms and microservices over the next   few years. I expect to see larger growth from slower moving companies   further down the road as older platforms are refactored and   re-architected to take advantage of new technology like this that   decouples the code from managing infrastructure.

There are a lot of competitors in the space. However, few offer the same   range of products, or the same level convenience and ease of setup and   operation that Cloudflare does. This makes it an easy transition for   many companies, while also allowing them to consolidate tools and   platforms into a single company.

**Some Other Highlights**

* Massive growth over the last two years - Beating expectations - Revenue rose  to  $125.9 million from $83.9 million in the year-ago quarter
* \~66% increase in stock price since IPO
* Companies with similar offerings range from \~$100-$200 per share
* Broad range of products that help companies consolidate multiple tools/platforms into a single platform
* Most Cloudflare services, like overall traffic, is not billed on usage, which keeps costs predictable
* Ease of use - Very easy to roll out quickly
* Low total cost of ownership
* Great customer service
* Focus on innovation - Tons of new products over the last two years
* Early to the Edge Computing space
* Provides value to free customers and the public
   * Free accounts with basic DDoS Protection
   * Cloudflare for Teams was free for quite a bit of 2020 to help in the pandemic
   * 1.1.1.1 private DNS Servers
   * Project Fair Shot
* %5-%10 of internet traffic goes through Cloudflare (as of 2018)
   * \~16% of Fortune 1,000 runs through Cloudflare

# Potential Downsides

Currently, Cloudflare is not profitable, but I believe it is getting close. I expect to see them profitable within a year or two. Their most recent report was a fourth-quarter loss of $34 million, but the adjusted loss was 2 cents per share vs 6 cents per share a year ago.

Edge   computing is still new. I don't see it being widely utilized in most   organizations for a few years, as it can require re-architecture. It's   easier for new platforms being written from the ground up or   micro-services being moved over to it.

# A Few Prominent Companies Who Use Cloudflare

* Discord - Yes, we hate them, they kicked us off, but we'd take them back. Right?
* Hubspot
* Zendesk
* OneTrust
* Panasonic
* Shopify
* AutoTrader
* Ivanti
* Udacity
* OkCupid

**TLDR:**   This company has strong products and leadership. I expect Cloudflare to  hit $200+ per share within a year or two based on their growth, offerings, earnings, and comparable companies. This is a long play, so don't expect a moon rocket overnight.

Cloudflare is one of the few companies that I'm genuinely excited about. Some of   the products and updates they've made over the last two years have been   awesome.",2021-02-17 02:50:48
TSM and the Global Automotive Semiconductor Shortage,137,ll7xmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm_and_the_global_automotive_semiconductor/,74,1613522889.0,"If you haven't heard yet, there is a global semiconductor shortage that is hitting automotive companies pretty hard right now. Look it up and read about it.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-chip-shortage-ford-vw-gm-11613152294?mod=searchresults\_pos2&page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-chip-shortage-ford-vw-gm-11613152294?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1)

Missing a $1 chip prevents automotive companies from releasing a $40,000 car. Ford and GM are curtailing production in their US plants due to the shortage and Americans are going out of work. This doesn't look good for anyone.

Why not just produce more automotive chips you might ask? Because producing automotive chips are not as profitable as producing chips for iPhones and gaming computers. Nvidia sells gaming processors for "" several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world‚Äôs automobiles can fetch a dollar or less.""

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-quick-fix-for-auto-chip-shortage-11612883643](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-quick-fix-for-auto-chip-shortage-11612883643)

It is only profitable for companies to produce automotive chips if they can do so in large enough quantities, driving down costs of production and making profit possible. Economists call this *economies of scale.* This is what positions Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry in the world, in a good place right now. TSM currently produces ""about 70% of the microcontroller units used in the world‚Äôs automobiles,"" and semiconductor companies which account for ""nearly 80% of the automotive chip market, all use TSMC for some of their manufacturing."" They are also best positioned to meet the shortage because they have the most infrastructure in place.

US Automotive companies are pressuring Biden to fix the shortage. The administration recently announced that they are looking into what ""immediate actions"" they can take and are "" working with allies to develop a coordinate response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers.""

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-working-to-address-chip-shortage-affecting-automakers-other-industries-11613066609?mod=searchresults\_pos2&page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-working-to-address-chip-shortage-affecting-automakers-other-industries-11613066609?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1)

Any immediate action will have to involve TSM in some way. To manufacture the chips in the US would take years. TSM also has ties to the US as it recently announced plans to build a foundry in Arizona by 2024. I don't know exactly what form Biden's ""immediate action"" will take but I have a feeling it will be good for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks.

Aside from the automotive semiconductor shortage, TSM is a great play for other reasons. TSM's fundamentals are solid. TSM also produces AMD and Apple chips, and there are rumors that Intel might also begin outsourcing production to TSM.

TLDR: TSM is best positioned to gain from current automotive semiconductor shortage and prices could shoot up in coming weeks.",2021-02-17 02:48:09

My original play was June 35cs which were the furthest OTM options available at the time (IIRC).

I sadly sold my position as I was expecting the market to crash because of a certain stock, but have now decided to get back in because it's obvious that we're in the greatest bull run of all time, and nothing will stop the gain train.

The Biden administration is settling in nicely (I think) and historically the markets have performed better under a Democratic president with a split/Republican congress.

It is chock-full of stonks that are brimming with growth potential, such as ROKU, TTD, BYND, DKNG. These are different from the S&P and NASDAQ 100 because those companies are basically as big as you can get, whereas QQQJ comprises of companies which are vying to reach the top 100/500 spot.

Additionally, we're seeing huge levels of participation in the market. \*that stock\* caused a huge influx of TikTok traders that are looking for the next cool ETF to invest in. As more people look for alternatives to boomer ETFs like SPY and QQQ, they'll turn to QQQ's cool younger brother.

Furthermore, 40c premiums are currently really cheap (less than $1), and stand to benefit yugely from an influx of options traders. The more attention QQQJ gets, the higher the premiums go, irrespective of the price.

I've been amazed and impressed by what WSB has done and the positive impact it has had on many people's lives.

As a fairly new member of WSB, I'm not as familiar with the history of the subreddit, so I'd like to understand more about that in addition to speaking about the famous short squeeze that made national headlines a few weeks ago.

The documentary is called ***Homepage Heroes: How the Internet took on Wall Street.*** Obviously, from the title, I want to also talk about how WSB has taken power away from Wall Street and revealed the flaws in the US stock market system.

***But I'd like to hear from YOU, degenerate!*** I'm looking to conduct a few on-camera interviews with members of this community who have been particularly active throughout the past few weeks, have had a lot at stake for the sake of going to the moon, or have been a part of the community for a long time.

I am hoping for at least a few of these, but I am also happy to conduct interviews via zoom if necessary.

Again, I'm looking for ***VERY*** active members of WSB, and degenerates that have been a part of WSB for a good amount of time and have invested a ***LARGE*** amount of money. I don't care if you have a large gain or loss, and I'm willing to work with whatever level of anonymity you would like, even as far as censoring your face.

As a student, I am also not a cop, or a fed, or in any position to put any interview subjects at any risk. Like I said in the post, I'm willing to maintain as much anonymity as you would prefer.

Investors turn even more bullish with semiconductors & pot skyrocketing. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish at all time highs with the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/9QkK5ca) gaining 1% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/o3g9vaq) rose by 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/TMdS1Ly) outperformed rising 1.7%, as 8 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/VejvtiI) finished the week with gains, with Utilities and Consumer Discretionary losing over 1%, but it‚Äôs important to note that the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/qFVLzd6) also closed at the lowest level in almost a year, as it closed under 20 on Friday.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/cvTchF7) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows pretty mixed results, with semiconductors & financials popping while the rest of the stock market had mixed results.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as the TD Ameritrade January [Index](https://imgur.com/V78bPVC) came in at 6.91, up over 10% over December as most retail investors bought Apple, AMD & AT&T. The other interesting number that we received was the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/Pi3tk6d), which showed what I was expecting, as it came in with a more bullish view of the retail investors as I predicted last week, which is one thing to look at as a contrarian indicator, so right now, I‚Äôm not really adding anything to my portfolio, but I am still gathering some cash for the next correction/pullback.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw Job [Openings](https://imgur.com/URoCI4p) in December coming in slightly better than expectations as the job opening rate stood at 4.5% while the jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/Ouf4H1d) came in down almost 20k vs last week but was higher than expected by analyst as the number of continuing jobless claim grew by over 50K.

This [week](https://imgur.com/1foTccl) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with only jobless claims and some preliminary numbers of the PMIs while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/rySV2ud) front, we do have a couple of interesting ones left with names like Shopify, Fastly, Roku, Walmart, Fiverr & many others reporting.

In some other stock market news, we saw pot stocks torching the market towards new highs in the beginning of the week, only to [crumble](https://imgur.com/TNZOw4X) on Thursday, but still, most of the stocks managed to finish the week with very big gains. We can see that the [ETF](https://imgur.com/XgntUvu) for these stocks has crushed the markets and has almost doubled already this year. This hole spike started after Tilray announced an agreement with Grow Pharma for a [deal](https://imgur.com/TuznO0z) in the UK and of [course](https://imgur.com/21Lt9F2) the ‚Äúchatter‚Äù on Reddit‚Äôs biggest stock market forum. And by the way, it‚Äôs still interesting to watch the Aphria/Tilray merger developments, to see if either Aphria spikes again, or if Tilray goes down to counteract the current 30% discount on the merger.

Meanwhile, despite popping on Monday after a [new](https://imgur.com/xwv5lEU) partnership with IBM which will be available starting in March, Palantir finished the week more than 5%, ahead of the Q4 earnings results that will be announced this morning, and should be interesting to watch if they sustain the huge rise of the stock in the past months. (Later edit: PLTR beat on revenue but posted an unexpected loss of $0.06/share)

We also saw numbers from Tesla‚Äôs China [sales](https://imgur.com/fc8gduC), which more than doubled in 2020 and now stand at 21% of their total sales at almost $7B, as the model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China in 2020. Tesla also slumped last [week](https://imgur.com/KNzzLHK), despite popping on Monday after the disclosure of $1.5B in digital currency assets bought in January, as more [analysts](https://imgur.com/eMxGtXU) are pointing to a potential battery cell supply shortage in the future for EV companies.

Regarding earnings reports, there were a couple of interesting one‚Äôs last week, with Disney [posting](https://imgur.com/4x7GFjt) a surprise profit of $0.32 and beating on revenues, as Disney+ subscribers are nearing the 100M mark, while the current total direct-to-consumer subs stand at 146M. This helped the company return to profitability after just one quarter of negative [results](https://imgur.com/kvEjJN3), which is incredible given the big hit taken by the rest of their revenue streams.

Apple also had an interesting week after [reports](https://imgur.com/wHUEKv9) that they are not in talks with Hyundai, Kia on developing a self-driving electric car, while JP Morgan [speculated](https://imgur.com/UX2MvzG) they might partner with Renault, and pointed to a couple of interesting things, like Renault‚Äôs 1million units of excess capacity, their track record with contract manufacturing and the flexibility this might give Apple to having a bigger input on the manufacturing process. It‚Äôs also to be noted that this could be a nice synergy for them, as Renault & Nissan have struggled with their EV products, so this could provide a big presence across key regions for both of the companies, while also offering premium products, as Apple pretty much stands for premium offerings. Though, it‚Äôs still very [unclear](https://imgur.com/IYjOfBX) which way Apple will go, but it‚Äôs pretty safe to say, they are definetly moving forward with this project.

Also, regarding earnings reports we did have a couple of interesting ones, as the recent green energy favorite, [Enphase](https://imgur.com/tvpnxk0) beat expectations by $0.11, as the stock popped on better-than-expected guidance for the next quarter.

We also saw [Twitter](https://imgur.com/KQb4ClB) beating expectations for the quarter on the top and bottom line, but disappointed on monetizable daily users which came in 1.5M lower than expected, though this didn‚Äôt stop the stock to pop to new highs at over $70.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://imgur.com/Yk0tdaK) also posted great beats on the earnings report as the company showcased an EBIT 20% beat than expected, but this didn‚Äôt help the stock as it sold off after the report that it may also be high be the global chip shortage, as this has made big companies like [NVIDIA](https://imgur.com/oVFjne0) to bring back older products to meet the insane demand for semiconductors.

One last piece of news for the week was that Qualcomm unveiled their [new](https://imgur.com/vrKYXlS) 5G modem to compete in this new 5G rush, while also [objecting](https://imgur.com/9epoJGz) to NVIDIA possible ARM acquisition, as this could possibly limit other chipmakers accessing the intellectual property possessed by ARM, as this is used in 95% of the world‚Äôs smartphones.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good week in the stock markets again, as we have to keep an eye on what big companies like Walmart & Shopify announce later in the week.

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Callaway ($ELY) DD,40,ll62vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll62vv/callaway_ely_dd/,78,1613517880.0,"**INTRO**

Hello! Below you can find my DD for Callaway Golf, $ELY.

Let's dig in.

**OVERVIEW**

Callaway is one of the leading names in the golf industry. They are a market leader in golf clubs, number two in golf balls, sponsor some of the largest names on the PGA tour, and tap into several revenue streams with golf equipment, clothing, and potentially recreation if their merger with Top Golf completes as is expected. While the stock low of $4.75 in March of 2020 has long passed, coupled with the recent all time high of $32.59 in February of 2021, this still profiles as a strong long-term hold stock in the coming years.

**WHY IS THIS A VALUE?**

In the [recent Callaway Earnings](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zarvyiy6) Call in Feb 2021, board members including CEO Oliver ""Chip"" Brewer were ecstatic about the ""impressive growth"" golf has witnessed during the time period Covid screeched many other leisure outlets to a halt.

Callaway works to have something for golfers at every stage of the market. Their Strata series is often a go-to for newer golfers, with a durable, well made product tailored for those deciding if the hobby is fun enough for a larger investment.

There was a 41% increase YOY in 4Q for rounds played, contributing to the 14% overall increase during 2020 as a whole. Covid or not, people were golfing.

Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow, $ELE has seen a 108% increase from $303M in 2019 to $632M at the end of 2020 in available liquidity. They will use this to invest in multiple revenue streams including Top Golf which is covered below.

FY21 is expected to be around pre-covid numbers for gross margin as the brand continues improving from the pandemic. The company is also #1 in Hard Goods in both Japan and Europe, and is considered the #1 club brand in the U.S. It's golf ball trails shortly behind Titleist but still owns roughly 17% of the market, or 1-in-5 golfers.

**REVENUE STREAMS**

When those new golfers, coupled with the continued influx of baby boomers retiring are ready for their new and improved set of clubs, Callaway has top of the line products to provide across all revenue streams. Not only do they create premium drivers, irons, and putters (Odyssey), they also tap in with golf balls, leisure and outdoor clothing (Travis Mathew, Jack Wolfskin), performance apparel and training equipment. While Callaway and other golf retailers are confident in meeting demands, the industry itself is holding all time low levels of inventory. The game is booming.

The company saw a NON-GAAP 4Q increase of $14 million to $162M total, but this was due mainly to increasing employee pay, catering to increased demand of product, and working to prepare the launch of several revenue streams like Travis Mathew retail stores.

Callaway finds a customer committed to playing the game. Provides options for a starter set or top of the line clubs, clothing, golf balls, etc. and also sponsors several pros like Phil Mickelson and John Rahm to show you just what their product can do on the tour.

This level of synergy had CEO Brewer boasting in the recent earnings call about the ""Largest golf consumer ecosystem in the world.""

And that is all without mentioning the likely merger with Top Golf which will be voted on with likely success March 3.

**TOP GOLF MERGER**

What is [Top Golf](https://topgolf.com/us/)?

Imagine an arcade-style driving range where 50% of the customers do not even consider themselves golfers. It captures all demographics from enthusiasts of the game to the group of friends who want to drink at a bar while cranking some drives. It is home to Top Tracer technology which helps track golf shots and provides feedback. Top Golf installs these Top Tracer systems into hundreds of driving bays across the country on top of housing at Top Golf itself, providing monthly income to the company through renting the service.

With over 50 locations in operation across multiple countries, Callaway has been involved with Top Golf since 2006, owning 14% of the company. A merger was announced in October 2020 and is expected to be voted on and approved on March 3.

Top Golf itself is valued at around $2.5 Billion dollars, but carries with it around half a billion in debt. This appears to be of little concern to Callaway, who is flush with cash and sees the potential revenue streams created by owning a highly successful arcade driving range.

Equipment costs and inventory concerns will be lowered even further for Callaway as it can not only supply product used during Top Golf sessions, but sell products for consumers to take home if they decide to pick up the game on actual courses.

The earnings call mentioned the excitement surrounding the merger, but did not go heavily into financial details. They were very conservative with their outlook and worked hard not to speculate, especially considering the current pandemic and its issues. All that said, you can't understate the potential impact this will have on the company.

**INVENTORY**

Inventory is down overall across golf due to a ""robust demand"" across the total industry inventory. Inventory in the field for 5.2 months last year. 2.2 inventory this december 2020. Entire industry will ""be in chase mode, our inventory in the field is slightly below the industry average"" and is a ""reflection on unprecedented demand.""

Callaway is once again in a prime position to capitalize on this. The company has heavily invested in ecommerce, and is doing a fantastic job of capturing the digital market as well as the second hand club market with its website [CallawayPreOwned.com](https://callawaypreowned.com/)

With the addition of Top Tracer technology inside Callaway shops, more custom fitted clubs and less bulk inventory can be expected as well as Callaway capitalizes on the data to save money at the bottom line.

**COMPETITION**

Callaway's market cap is 2.82B despite a fairly low volume average of 1.8M per session. Acushnet (Titleist) is slightly higher at a 3B market cap, and Ping are among Callaway's competitors.

TaylorMade is another competitor of Callaway after being sold for $425M by Adidas in 2017. TaylorMade is up for sale once again and is [projected to be had for around $2 Billion dollars](https://thegolfnewsnet.com/ryan_ballengee/2021/02/02/taylormade-golf-up-for-sale-by-owner-kps-capital-partners-report-121878/).

For TaylorMade to X5 in Value over the course of a few years, it speaks to the potential that a long standing brand like Callaway brings to the table (and don't forget Top Golf!).

**STOCK ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION**

Obligatory mention that I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research. Not suggesting to buy literally anything at all.

After a quick look at the chart and using my background knowledge of golf, I felt that Callaway was a solid value at 28-30 bucks a share given where the game is now. This was before I learned of the pending Top Golf merger. Capturing that base of potential customers, selling equipment and clothing to existing customers, and access to the toptracer technology, this feels like an extremely strong long term investment.

Feel free to do your own digging for analysts you trust, I am not even linking them here to encourage that. From the areas I trust, as well as digging around I did elsewhere, this stock could see a few bucks in short term growth and really see some movement with a long term hold.

I personally own a position I plan to add on soon, but I do not intend to part with these shares for a couple years. I have gathered information I am comfortable investing with in shares and I am not confident in playing options at this time.

Please ask any questions in the comments as I have more info in my notebook that I haven't put into this DD.

TL;DR Won‚Äôt rocket and you can probably get in even cheaper if you watch it, but stock has promising long term (1+ year) growth.",2021-02-17 01:24:40

So that means all things $DKNG $PENN and casino related stocks but $DKNG looks like the immediate play with earnings around the corner. Legal gambling will continue to moon.

It‚Äôs filled with copious amounts of misinformation from someone who claims to be a historian who ‚Äústudied the country for a long time‚Äù. It also goes against what this sub is about

The market is a casino and we‚Äôre all here to play. Politics has no place here. Despite the OP saying his post isn‚Äôt political. It is. He calls one political party a band of pirates (which there is no proof for) and claims another party is responsible for having inflation rates above 9% twice in 20 years (3 times in 27) because of quantitative easing, which is a crappy idea has only been brought in recently due to the pandemic. The times where this inflation spike happened were in 2008, a tough year for the whole world economically, In 2002 which was also only 8 years after becoming a democracy and years before Zuma began his corruption scandal when he took control, and in 1993, when said party wasn‚Äôt even in power! So much for being a historian. Look, South Africa isn‚Äôt a paradise with rainbows, butterflies and crayons dipped in glue, it‚Äôs got some of the problems most 3rd world countries do, but it‚Äôs absolutely NOTHING like the mostly racist hellhole with sanctioned corruption that the OP described.

I could make an entire post arguing against the crap he said but my wife‚Äôs boyfriend is typing this for me and he‚Äôs upset that I‚Äôm wasting time that he could be spending plowing his girl. And also because that would be hypocritical because I‚Äôm against making this sub political. We‚Äôre not here to play heroes.

TL;DR: Someone said we should short South Africa and gave blatantly politically motivated and downright false information to persuade people to join him. We shouldn‚Äôt. And we shouldn‚Äôt allow posts like that to get attention.

Edit: Short South Africa if you want, I don‚Äôt care. Just don‚Äôt spread doom-mongering and misinformation while you‚Äôre at it.

Edit: I get it's within the rules to use the political situation to make a play but is saying that teachers in the country don't know fucking square roots relevant at all?",2021-02-17 01:15:28

**A look at their** [**10-Q**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)

Let‚Äôs start with a look at their financial standing as of the end of September 2020. Obviously, a lot of things have happened since then and we‚Äôll get to that later, but let‚Äôs first take a look at what their latest available financial position was to see how bad it was getting. Going through their 10-Q, here‚Äôs some of their Q3 highlights

* Income Statement
   * Revenue - 120M (-85% YoY)
   * Operating Expenses - 795M (-39% YoY)
   * Net Loss - 906M
* Balance Sheet
   * Cash & Equivalents - 418M
   * Current Assets - 609M
   * Total Assets - 10.9B
   * Current Liabilities - 1.59B
   * Total Liabilities - 13.2B
   * Total Equity (Deficit)  - (2.3B) deficit vs 1.2B equity in Q3 2019
* Cash Flows
   * Operations - (772M)
   * Investing - (155M)
   * Financing - 1.08B
      * Raised over 1B cash from senior bond issuances
   * Net Cash Increase - 153M
* Notes & Forward Guidance
   * Refinanced 87% of outstanding bonds for bonds due 2026 for higher-interest bonds w/ a principal reduction of 555M
   * Lenders have given relief from maintenance covenants in their bonds temporarily. Will need to increase cash flow or EBITDA back to a sufficient level by the end of March, when the relief ends, to be in compliance with the covenants or else the bondholders can make the bonds payable / due immediately, unless lenders agree to extend it
   * Cash burn = 388M during Q3
   * Expects rent to be drastically increased starting in 2021 due to expiration of rent deferrals
   * 600M in convertible debt to Silver Lake
   * (335M) EBITDA in Q3
   * **Expected to run out of cash by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, will require a sudden source of liquidity or increase in theatre attendance to not go bankrupt.**

**Recent Events**

The last point can basically sum up the important part of the 10-Q; that they‚Äôve basically exhausted all possible sources of liquidity, and they would have most likely gone bankrupt some time early in 2021. They have a massive net deficit of 2.3B, which means that it would have been extremely likely that the shareholders would have been left with nothing in the case of bankruptcy. Even if their liquidity issues weren‚Äôt going to immediately force them to bankruptcy, their inability to meet their debt covenants when they expire at the end of March would have likely put them in default if lenders gave up hope and started cutting their losses.

All of this meant that literally every hedge fund analyst looking at this would have recommended their fund go short on AMC, since it seemed obvious that they were about to go bankrupt - the management even stated this in their most recent financial statements; this is why AMC ended up with a 39M / 57M of the float short (69% SI) at the end of 2020 - it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and AMC bottomed out at $1.91 when all seemed lost and the intrinsic value of the stock was $0 in every analyst‚Äôs mind.

Except, [as I‚Äôve learned last year the hard way](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h945ly/dddd_retail_investors_bankruptcies_dark_pools_and/), even if all the fundamentals and financials point to an obvious bankruptcy is coming in the near term, it‚Äôs been a weird year and anything can happen. Specifically

1. [Silver Lake converted all of their $600M of debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) to 44M shares during the AMC spike
2. It raised $917M in cash from debt and equity (165M shares issued)

Assuming the cash burn remained the same levels as Q3, which is the worst case scenario as states are much more likely to relax restrictions this year with vaccinations rolling out, this cash should last them all the way into Q4 2021. This also makes it much more likely that debt holders would extend their debt covenant waiver now that imminent bankruptcy is off the table. r/wallstreetbets **had effectively saved AMC from bankruptcy**.

**AMC Today**

With this background, there‚Äôs two mispricings that lends itself to a high-probability play.

1. As of Feb 12, AMC was at $5.59, which is barely double the share price of it back when they seemed to be approaching near-certain imminent bankruptcy in a few weeks
2. The Implied Volatility of put options are still extremely high based on the recent price action

Here‚Äôs some examples of the prices and IV of put options for AMC

[Feb 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/wkm8nscusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bc0f459ac9d0a5c14587fe72733c727934c5c1)

[Mar 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/winpkfjusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cec5b9b71d92e5b16fbf06570e95ed833750d45a)

Furthermore, [as of 1/29 data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC), there‚Äôs still 38M shares short, meaning that not that many funds that were actually shorting AMC actually covered yet. Of course, because AMC was printing new shares like they‚Äôre JPowell to print themselves out of bankruptcy, the short interest went down to 15% of float, meaning it‚Äôll be very unlikely to see another short squeeze.

**Thesis**

1. The stock is fundamentally undervalued at a market cap of $1.9B and share value of $5.50 (based on historical pricing; anyone doing an actual DCF analysis would say the equity is worth negative dollars because debt > EV). They were last at this price in late September, when there was uncertainty of their ability to survive another wave of lockdowns, and was $4.50 at late November, literally a month before they stated in their 10Q that they‚Äôve already released that they would run out of cash and go bankrupt. Compared to this, it makes no sense for this stock to still be at $5.50 now that it‚Äôs extremely likely that AMC will not go bankrupt.
2. The Implied Volatility on the put side is insanely high, especially if you consider that AMC is likely undervalued, and hedge funds probably aren‚Äôt going to be adding additional shorts of AMC at this price, especially after seeing what happened to it a few weeks ago.

**The Play**

To take advantage of the mispricings, I‚Äôve been short (i.e. write / sold) cash-covered puts on AMC on $5 and $6 strike prices for Feb, Mar, and Apr expiries since last week. Theta decay and a decreasing IV has caused the prices of these puts to go down substantially, but imo they‚Äôre still ridiculously overpriced. For example, to lose money on selling $5.50 puts expiring in a few days, AMC will need to go down to $5.15 (almost 10%). For March and April ATM puts, AMC would need to go below $4.50 to lose money, which is below the share price of AMC when bankruptcy was imminent. And if AMC stays above $5.50 by that time, you‚Äôd be making a healthy 21% return in 1 month.",2021-02-17 01:02:45
GME & CMKM,138,ll5m9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5m9b/gme_cmkm/,27,1613516551.0,"I was researching if anything like GME ever happened in the past and came across the Canadian stock ticker CMKM that traded in the U.S.

From what I have gathered a bunch of stock holders purchased this penny stock hoping for a big pay day on a rumored buyout and short sellers got squeezed. The SEC halted trading because of an extravagant amount of failure to deliver and traders were required to request certificates from their brokers and it was discovered there was a large amount of counterfeit stock.

This is from 2006 this happened and is still being litigated to this day.

I only know what you can find with Google as this is before my time so if any boomers are here maybe they can chime in.

If there is a large amount of counterfeit stock what is to prevent this from happening today? If the squeeze does happen who is to say they won't halt trading and then it's discovered some shareholders aren't actually shareholders? Seems like the shareholders both won in this case in that they were right and lost in this case as the SEC froze trading and its still being litigated 16 years later.",2021-02-17 01:02:31

PLTR's Absolutely INSANE Capital Structure And Why It's Actually a Competitive Advantage. üöÄüöÄüöÄ,702,ll4ocn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll4ocn/pltrs_absolutely_insane_capital_structure_and_why/,230,1613513755.0,"TL;DR: If you love America & money **buy the PLTR Dip**

Hey folks. I just read some of PLTR's actual S-1 filing with SEC which describes their multi-class capital structure and it's just pure bonkers:

[https://investors.palantir.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14399361](https://investors.palantir.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14399361)

They created special ""Class F"" shares for the founders, such that the **total of all class F shares at all times have 49.99999% of the voting power of all outstanding shares**. This calculation is not static; these shares have ""variable"" voting power, meaning Founders can sell their shares without losing any voting power, however many shares they are left with then have 49.999999% of the voting power. And they can issue brand new shares as much as they want and it will never dilute their voting power.

This is absolutely unique and frankly a little crazy. To the point that the lawyers  felt the need to spell out the obvious in the prospectus:

>**Accordingly, our Founders will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings without diminishing their voting control.**

The trio could sell off their roughly 30% ownership down to 6% and still maintain full control of the company. What's more Class F shares are not transferable or inheritable. In case of the death of a Founder, the remaining voting rights are split amongst Founders who are still alive. Basically, Palantir is a fucking tontine between Karp, Thiel and Cohen. They've structured this in a way that they will control PLTR in perpetuity.

[Real-life photo of Peter Thiel with his voting rights.](https://preview.redd.it/zjdn74xq5uh61.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c751b9cbd8506280b7b8c623ab60c3a226d528fb)

They appear to have crafted a way to get listed on the stock exchange while remaining privately controlled.

**Now why did they do this? And how could this be bullish?** It's all guesswork, but I think there is two parts to it. This little bit from the S-1, suggests a clue:

>Our relationships with government customers and customers that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including organizations whose products or activities are or are perceived to be harmful, has resulted in public criticism, including from political and social activists, and unfavorable coverage in the media. **Activists have also engaged in public protests at our properties.** Activist criticism of our relationships with customers could potentially engender dissatisfaction among potential and existing customers, investors, and employees with how we address political and social concerns in our business activities. Conversely, being perceived as yielding to activism targeted at certain customers could damage our relationships with certain customers.

In 2019, [some liberals in Palo Alto protested Palantir's ICE contracts](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-protest-palo-alto-activists-ice-contracts-2019-8) for a hot second. Suffice to say, the Founders have political opinions that do not reflect those of social activists and likely a big portion of their employees. The class F shares immunizes the corporate leadership from ""yielding to activism"", as they put it.

However, the more important point is that, **PLTR is not non-political** per se. The corporation very much has opinions:

>***We do not work with the Chinese communist party and have chosen not to host our platforms in China, which may limit our growth prospects.***  
>  
>Our leadership believes that working with the Chinese communist party is inconsistent with our culture and mission. We do not consider any sales opportunities with the Chinese communist party, do not host our platforms in China, and impose limitations on access to our platforms in China in order to protect our intellectual property, to promote respect for and defend privacy and civil liberties protections, and to promote data security. Our decision to avoid this large potential market may limit our growth prospects and could adversely impact our business

And

>***We may not enter into relationships with potential customers if we consider their activities to be inconsistent with our organizational mission or values.***  
>  
>We generally do not enter into business with customers or governments whose positions or actions we consider inconsistent with **our mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies.**

This is very, very different from most of Wall Street, as most corps cannot help themselves from genuflecting before Xi. In many ways, excluding China is against the interests of shareholders who are there to make money. This would be unsustainable, without the unique capital structure that allows the founders to maintain the founding values of the corporation.

Now what the fuck am I saying, we're here to make money, not support Western liberal democracy. I make fun of the idiots who come here with ""iTs NoT aBoUt ThE MoNeY"".

The thing is, PLTR's primary customer is the US government, and I believe their ""mission to support Western liberal democracy"" is actually a selling point here and gives them a competitive advantage in the government contractor space. Especially in the defense sector.

That being said, Buying and Holding PLTR is essentially supporting Western liberal democracy, so:

# The Business Model:

Alibaba serves as the Paypal, Square, eBay and Amazon of China. Alibaba serves as the one stop shop for all ecommerce and even non ecommerce related goods and services. Did I forget to mention Alibaba has its own movie production company? (AMC Anyone?) The synergy of the ecommerce arm: from allowing sales and purchases, accepting payments for sales and purchases, and even potentially financing those same respective sales and purchases makes for an ironclad business model. Alibaba also has numerous investments in many different industries and regions around the globe. 

**Ecommerce, Online Retail, Wholesale** ‚Äì Alibaba‚Äôs bread and butter. Alibaba has a multitude of sales channels that have different buying and selling methods with various different products and audience targets. Their ecommerce encompasses all relationships between consumers, businesses, and both. 

**Cloud** ‚Äì Cloud computing is a top market right now given that we‚Äôre not only working from home due to the pandemic, but we will also implement many of these habits in perpetuity as many businesses switch to a hybrid WFH format. Best synergizes with AutoNavi (Google maps of China) and data collected from consumer sales.

**Digital Entertainment and Media** ‚Äì From streaming to video hosting or even online ticket booking, Alibaba has it all.  You can purchase tickets to your favorite sports event, movie, or watch it all online. 

**Notable Alibaba Owned Companies/Services:**

**Taobao** ‚Äì Marketplace and online retail platform focusing on **consumer to consumer** online stores and purchases. Includes Taobao Grocery, Taobao Short Video, Taobao Live, and many more to come

**Aliexpress** ‚Äì International retail online platform for Chinese sellers to sell products. Example markets may include: Russia, Brazil, Singapore, U.S. and more)

**Tmall ‚Äì** Online retail platform to sell name brand goods to consumers in the greater China region. This is mainly a **business to consumer** platform

**1688.com** ‚Äì Wholesale platform with many digital sellers. This is the largest wholesale website in China which primarily functions as a **business to business** sales platform

**Youku** ‚Äì Digital streaming and online video hosting service for Alibaba; similar to YouTube

**AutoNavi** ‚Äì Maps services; comparable to Google or Apple Maps

**Daimai.cn** ‚Äì Online ticket booking service; Similar to Ticketmaster

**Alipay** ‚Äì Accepting payment methods for your ecommerce purchase, movie tickets, taxis, or even to send from peer to peer. Alipay is standard across many stores in China and many regions in Asia as a dominant payment platform with 

**Ant Financial Group** ‚Äì Fintech; Use for financing for small purchases

**Alihealth** ‚Äì Helps consumers find health insurance and receive medical treatment

# The Bull Case:

**Playing Catch up:** 

Alibaba has crushed earnings on the past 7/7 reports despite regulatory headwinds, international/domestic political pressures, and a pandemic. 

Given the previous financial data, if Alibaba were to trade at even half the P/E of Amazon (78.15/2= \~39) Alibaba would be priced at: **$363.79**

If Alibaba were to be priced at 75% of what Amazon‚Äôs current PE is (78.12\*75% = 58.6125) Alibaba would be priced at: **$545.68**

Analysts currently have a downside price target of $270 and an upside of [$387](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) [according to Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) finance. These price targets can easily be revised upwards with positive sentiment and an increase of both earnings and share price. With an upside of $387 for the year, that‚Äôs approximately 43% upside (even more so with options) that will make your leaps and shares mouthwatering to purchase.

**Who‚Äôs on your side?**

[Cathie Wood](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-sells-tesla-shares-184315217.html)‚Äì As of Nov 2020 sold Tesla shares to purchase Alibaba within its Ark Innovation ETF $ARKF

[Ray Dalio](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Bridgewater+Associates) ‚Äì Recently purchased and currently owns approximately 400 million dollars of Alibaba in the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund which is the largest hedge fund in the world

[Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FASe4D_pEi4&t=140s) \-As of Jan 2021 Lightning round mentioned to buy Alibaba

Most of Wall Street ‚Äì According to [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BABA/price-target/), numerous large institutional banks and equity research firms (including JPM, Citi, HSBC) have buy or strong buy ratings with price targets easily in the 300+ range.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Ant Group IPO ‚Äì For stakeholders, this has been a long awaited IPO. Alibaba owns a 33% stake in Antgroup which was set to be one of the largest fintech IPOs in history before it was blocked by the CCP. A reintroduction of the IPO may send shares flying

More Hedge Fund Buying ‚Äì This stock is one of the largest holdings of many investment funds, hedge funds, and large portfolios. This is also considered a safer stock which appeals more to larger funds who are looking for potential returns

Buybacks ‚Äì Alibaba boosted their current stock buybacks plan from 6B to 10B reiterating confidence within the company and ideally, will boost the stock price 

The monopoly probe ending ‚Äì China slaps Alibaba on the wrist with a few slight changes within the marketplace and a small fine that they can easily write off

China Friendly Political Environment ‚Äì With Trump out and Joe Biden in office, we may see more relaxed regulatory pressure on Chinese stocks (delistings, business bans, etc.)

One of many of their investments kicking off: One example of this is Alibaba's recent partnership with SAIC in the EV space with improved battery technology. If Alibaba is partnered with a company that develops FSD technology, this could be one of their biggest catalysts

The JACK IS BACK: Jack Ma was recently found to be safe through various video clips and word of mouth. If he were to show his face publicly and make a public statement or apology, this could help lift off the stock further

WSB!: Although this is a large cap stock with many shares outstanding, the traction and buying power of WSB collectively could easily put this stock on the radar of larger investment funds and add to share price

# The Bear Case:

**Equity Research Findings:**

>\-A Morningstar equity research report specifically stated: ‚ÄúExpansion of other China digital commerce players like Pinduoduo and JD.com could slow Alibaba's growth aspirations in certain product categories.‚Äù

Translation: Alibaba will STILL grow despite other players gaining in additional market share for the business. Let me repeat this: Alibaba‚Äôs key bear case is that they will not decline or stagnate; THEY WILL STILL GROW albeit slightly slower 

**China will try to take Alibaba out of the picture:**

\-The CCP will end Alibaba and give the reigns to someone else

China and the United States have been in constant fight to come up on top. What makes the United States a dominant force is not only their policy and military, but also our **top companies and infrastructure**. China is aggressively catching up to the United States as a super power as a close second place (See NIO, Xpeng in the EV race compared to Tesla or Huawei vs Apple in the race for 5G infrastructure). Do you think that China would even consider dissolving their top company in terms of internet and consumer infrastructure? Do you think that effectively scaring off fund managers (who currently own Alibaba), foreign investors, and foreign business interests will be a net benefit to China?

**CaYeMeHaN IsLaNd sToNkS aRe fRaUduLaNT!!!!**

\-If you make this claim, read this [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/) by user u/wilfredian before putting your red nose and clown makeup on. TLDR: You can convert your American shares into Hong Kong shares for actual equity ownership at ANY TIME. Meaning it‚Äôs not just some pretend company; it is functionally equivalent to the shares traded on the HK exchange.

The Chinese are looking for more foreign investment in their economy (what developed country isn‚Äôt?). Think about this intuitively, China would not sabotage its golden goose (Alibaba) and breach the contract with many of its foreign partners to flex its political muscle on one company.

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to open flat after Dow closes at another record

> * U.S. stock futures were steady Wednesday as Wall Street remained on track for its best monthly performance since November. A mixed session Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at another record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke their two-day winning streaks with small losses, falling from previous session record high closes.

> * On Wednesday‚Äôs economic calendar, the Commerce Department is set to issue January retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect a 1.2% increase after a 0.7% December decline. At the same time, the Labor Department‚Äôs January look at producer prices is seen rising 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in December.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin soars to new high, topping $51,000 for first time

> * B/itcoin smashed through $51,000 to hit a new all-time high Wednesday. Major financial companies appear to be warming to b/itcoin, while Tesla and other firms have also shown support for the c/ryptocurrency. B/itcoin‚Äôs latest rally is reminiscent of its massive ascent to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by an 80% plunge the following year. However, the world‚Äôs biggest c/ryptocurrency did stage a fierce comeback since, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% since the start of this year.

*****

> # 3. Here are Warren Buffett-run Berkshire‚Äôs stock moves last quarter

> * Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes worth $4.1 billion in Chevron and $8.6 billion in Verizon shares during the fourth quarter, according to the conglomerate‚Äôs latest 13-F filing with the SEC. Berkshire also sold its stakes in drug maker Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, while trimming its Wells Fargo position. While still its biggest holding, Berkshire continued to trim its lucrative Apple stake, cutting it by about 6%. Four times a year, investors file their long positions with the government. The information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends.

*****

> # 4. Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX valuation jumps to about $74 billion

> * SpaceX completed another monster equity funding round of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company‚Äôs valuation skyrocketing 60% from its previous raise in August to about $74 billion. Elon Musk, who also co-founded Tesla, saw insiders and existing investors in his commercial space company selling an additional $750 million in a secondary transaction, one of the people said. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC‚Äôs request for comment on this report.

*****

> # 5. Millions in Texas still without power as new storm hits

> * Millions of residents in Texas were still in the dark Wednesday with no indication when their service might return as another winter storm moved across the southern part of the nation. In all, between 2 million and 3 million customers in the energy capital of the U.S. had no power ‚Äî two days after historic snow and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity for heat.

> * Wholesale power and natural gas prices soared in recent days. However, natural gas futures dropped early Wednesday. U.S. oil prices kept up their advance Wednesday, gaining more than 1% and pushing above $61 per barrel, levels not seen since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

Why I think Palantir will be net profitable next quarter (and stay that way),171,llu0s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llu0s7/why_i_think_palantir_will_be_net_profitable_next/,37,1613595794.0,"So if you're interested in PLTR i'm sure you paid some attention to yesterday's earnings reports, quite a lot of fud around disappointing earnings (not warranted, imo) and the lockup ending this week (possibly warranted, we will see, but not relevant to this post.

I saw a lot being made of PLTRs lack of profitability after 15 years (legitimate concern) and criticism about how much they pay themselves in stock being the cause (ditto). So, wanting to know the deal I stuck my tongue out, concentrated real hard and tried to read the numbers from yesterday's report, here are a few for the quarter:

**Gross Margin:** 79%

They report headline adjusted gross margin as 84% which excludes stock based compensation, this seems a cheat because it's essentially just pay so i added it back in for the 79%. Regardless, this is equivalent to facebooks margin, and has improved 12% over the last year. I'd also expect it to improve further next year, as I think a lot of the stock based compensation for this year was a one off and related to the DPO.

**Operating Margin:** 32%

Again this is adjusted to exclude stock, stock related taxes and DPO charges, but if you look at stock based compensation from Q4 2019 ($77MM) to Q4 2020 (\~$260MM) you can see that in a regular year, which 2021 will now be these stock related payments are going to go back to normal (though still higher than 77 due to higher pay & more staff, i'd guestimate $100MM a quarter for '21).

All of this is to say that PLTRs margins are actually great and if they hadn't taken the company public this year they would've been profitable already.

Now lets look at **Q1 21 forcast**:

45% YoY growth from Q1 20

23% adjusted operating margin

We can probably assume safely that these are going to be beat, a company with a model like PLTR's are going to be pretty sure what contracts they've got lined up in Q1 and they're not dumb enough to miss earnings by over estimating, we can likely expect these to actually be more like 50-55% and 30-35% IMO. For example, in Q3 20 they predicted $50MM (16% margin) in adjusted profit for Q4 and it ended up being $100MM (32% margin).

That gives us: 240 (Q1 2020 rev) \* 1.5 = $360MM rev in Q1 with an adjusted operating margin of 30% = $108MM adjusted operating profits Q1 '21. Unadjusting them if we assume stock based compensation relatively higher than 2019 and early 20 because of growth but returning to normal levels because the DPO is done, i guestimated $100MM in stock compensation leaving them net profitable for the first time.

I'd expect this to continue throughout but they don't offer much guidance for the rest of the year, just > 30% revenue, this was the same guidance they gave in Q3 2020 so just seems to be their minimum bar, does suggest they aren't more worried about growth in 2021 than they were in 2020.

&#x200B;

**Why does none of this matter anyway?**

1. PLTR have $1.8BB in cash and practically no debt ($200MM short term), so even if they lost $100MM a quarter to grow quicker, it's not a threat.
2. They're already super profitable, they just pay themselves a lot in stock bonuses, the lack of profitability is a choice, they literally sid that right now they don't care about profitability. Presumably this is because they feel they dont need to invest in capital to grow and instead focus on recruiting and then retaining and working hard (with $$$ incentive) the biggest brains they can find as being the most optimal path to growth and success. As an investor i'm perfectly fine with this because they're in their growth phase and an extra 10% growth compounded over several years will reap way more in profit than taking some profit now, anyway their margins are so good I know that eventually there's going to be profit for investors regardless.

Edit: **Position** 700 shares, planning to add 300 more if it dips below 25, shares only as i'm British, soz

Possible dips for following stocks based on different market short volumes syncing up and rising, based off of previous [post here predicting dips using different market volumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/) TLDR of that is there's a pattern when different market volumes start to sync and rise for a stock, said stock has a dip.

* **SNDL** dip **ESTIMATED** later this week depending on tomorrow's numbers, but maybe Thursday/Friday, but it may peak tomorrow, but watch for dip to follow!
* **TLRY** possibly later tomorrow but probably Thursday/Friday, depending on how/if price spikes tomorrow!
* **PLTR** estimated to keep dipping tomorrow **if it's not already too late**, but **volumes are synced HARD** and **short volumes have continued to grow despite consecutive days with price drops!** Hopefully Feb16th was the peak for short volume and they start to retreat tomorrow.

[SNDL has the short and short exempt volumes starting to rise going into Wednesday. Expect a rise in price followed by a dip after, maybe Thursday\/Friday!](https://preview.redd.it/o56u4uzsozh61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba47b2031a321a168cc201ac6e80afa1e283777)

**TLDR: Don't trust strangers on the INTERNET!!!!!**

* SNDL looks like the volumes are STARTING to sync, so late week dip possible
* TLRY's definitely look like they are starting to, update tomorrow after numbers come out, so dip probably Thursday, doubt it's as soon as tomorrow.
* PLTR volumes should have **CALMED the fuck DOWN** by now, but they're peaking?! Either dips tomorrow hard again, or we hit the floor, hopefully.
* **Don't turn my bullshit science into a self-fulfilling prophecy!**
   * ***""Buy the dip...""*** \-Rich Boyfriend of Ex-Wife
* **Short Exempt volumes** for these are all up, and I haven't even figured those in to my previous algo, but they're broker-dealer issued and ""self-regulated"" so... yea.
* If I'm wrong, God Willing, I'm sure I'll hear about it at the end of the week!

Edit1: Spelling

Edit2: **Tracking PreMarkets:**

* 6:45am: SNDL -10% , TLRY-7%, PLTR +1%
   * And when SNDL might add 1B shares, that tends to drop a price too!

$HRB H&R Block - Buy some leaps and forget about em,23,llok83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llok83/hrb_hr_block_buy_some_leaps_and_forget_about_em/,20,1613574590.0,"TLDR: Brick & Mortar  to tech pivot, share buyback, delayed share price recovery, cheap options = Buy and hold HRB Leaps

I'll keep this short because you guys have the attention span of a five year old:

5 Reasons to Buy $HRB Leaps:

1) HRB is currently valued as a Brick & Mortar boomer company (price/sales ratio of \~1x) while their main competitor Intuit $INTU is valued as a tech company (\~14x). However, H&amp;R Block is pivoting to a digital-age company (or at least trying to.) Last year, they added 3 VPs of information technology and acquired Wave Financial, a financial SaaS company funded by Social Capital. 

2) They have been buying back shares. Lots of shares. HRB's shares outstanding has fallen from 300m+ to under 200m since 2010, thanks to their share repurchase program. In 2015, HRB approved a $3.5b share repurchase program and they still have $600m of that which will fund their buy-backs into 2022. To put that into perspective: HRB's current market cap is $3.6b. They've been consistently buying back shares AND paying their dividends for over a decade. These repurchases also show up as losses in earnings report, thus giving the appearance of poor results to those who don't look carefully. When you compare its current price (\~$19) to its price in, say, 2019 (\~$26), don't forget that there are now \~10% less outstanding shares compared to back then!

3) Almost one year later, HRB still hasn't recovered to its pre-covid share price. In fact, even S&P has gained 75% from its March lows, while HRB only gained 59%. Looking at historical price data, HRB had its strongest run in '01 and '12: both about two years after the market recovers from a major downtown. Will 2022 be the year HRB reaches new ATH? I think so.

4) Rise in retail investing. To keep this short: if your tax situation is simple (just wages and a couple of deductible items) you can probably figure out how to file your taxes on your own. If you've been investing, however, you are better off talking to a tax professional. (Did you know that you may be able to offset taxable income up to $3000 if you have capital losses that exceed capital gains in a year?)

5) Something something death and taxes

IV on leaps are not bad right now. I bought some 2023 $25C for $1.77 the other day, and it's one of the cheapest leaps in my portfolio. 

Disclaimer: HRB 2023 20c and 25c x 10. This is not investment or tax advice. I like the stock.

BNGO gearing up for a gamma squeeze,0,llo5p0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llo5p0/bngo_gearing_up_for_a_gamma_squeeze/,23,1613573001.0,"I've been following Bionano Genomics for a few months now, and I finally think this has some mini gamma squeeze potential.  current price is floating around \~15$ a share, max option strikes are 25$.  The last few trading days have seen 10-20% gains, so it's already getting pretty close on it's own.

If you never heard of this company before, the TLDR is they created a Saphyr system to map variations in genomes better than anything else.  Then they figured out it can do all kinds of stuff, like detecting covid variants, diseases, etc.  It's taking over market share rapidly. Saphyr is set for release in March and there's been nothing but positive news about this company and their product. 

It's been steady moving, but my prediction this week is that either Wed or Thur the price will jump enough to cause a gamma squeeze.  The company itself has solid fundamentals with their product being released, so I don't see it being dumped anytime soon either.  With technology like CRISPR, being able to map genomic variations is going to be critical in the next 5-20 years even.

https://preview.redd.it/s26itvns6zh61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ab15bf07f4b44d4a105501569cbcefa57acf1a3

It's true that Bili is currently growing at a faster rate than HUYA, 70% as compared to 50%, however, this difference is huge, and I believe that HUYA can reach at least 10x P/S considering it is still a growing company.

&#x200B;

3. Institutional Holdings

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/njvxngvs7zh61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66722c00405d2213b12cb21fb35ffe71a43ce4a

Ark, MS, and Rentech heavily added positions in HUYA last quarter. A quick google search tells you that Tencent has a 37.2% stake in HUYA. Excluding companies below JOYY Inc. because the reports are old, we would get a total of 112.15% institutional holding. 

This is a similar situation to gamestop, although I don't this should be a short squeeze play, I think that a squeeze is very possible under the right conditions.

&#x200B;

4. Potential merger with DOYU

If they do merge, DOYU would be a better play because the share exchange ratio would be HUYA\*0.73=What you get for each DOYU share, but DOYU is the riskier play in this situation if they don't merge because DOYU is consistently losing market share to HUYA in china.

Some quick DD on Chinese websites tell you that Chinese people tend to prefer HUYA

Even if this merger doesn't go through I see this as a very good tech ""value"" play

7. Chinese stock craze

The Chinese stock market has been going harder than the US market recently. There are many Chinese stocks that are breaking out. Some examples include FUTU, TIGR, BILI, TME, YY.

I believe HUYA could be next but this is pure speculation.

The autist that posted the ['I am going to short the whole country of South Africa'](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/) earlier thread gave me enough of a chuckle to want to check out USDZAR and see just what the OP got himself in to.

When I checked the charts, I almost had to ask my wife's boyfriend to help clean up the massive load of cream that was spilling out of my pants. I legitimately had to call Stanley Steemer and ask for 2 vans to tackle the mess that was created.

USDZAR has has been trading straight downward for basically the past year. This means the ZAR has been gaining value against the US dollar during the pandemic. Historically, it hasn't traded straight downward this hard before. There were literally 8 solid months of bearish candle closes without any upward momentum during that period.

We have reached a critical support where by looking left, we can see there appears to be a lot of interest in price at this level. Orders were accumulating around this level for about a year and a half in 2018 and 2019 before blasting the fuck off from $14 to over $19 in less than 3 months. Yesterday's trading day was very bullish, closing higher than the previous closes on the last 4 trading days.

*Please do not forget the levels of retardation going in to this. There is no weekly confirmation of bullish momentum, and we could always see this support at 14.50 get broken and a commencement of buyers getting skullfucked. This trade could just be a liquidity grab to nab up buy orders and drop again.*

I transferred over about $50 to an account just to YOLO on this for shits and gigs. I almost instantly doubled my account with that phat ass daily bullish closure today.

My max potential loss on this trade is the size of the account as the broker has negative balance protection. I only put up $8 in margin (which is returned after position close) to open the positions (0.04 lot total) and paid $0.28 in commission to the broker. Swap is charged at the open of every Asian session if you don't close your position. This was $0.20 per position, or $0.80 total for the day to keep my positions open. If we go back to previous levels at $19, this trade will generate around $1200 total for these positions, roughly $300 each, or 24x gains on the account size.

Scarily enough, I actually could have opened a position 5x the size that I did, but that would obviously end things very quickly should price dip too far below entry. With my entries, the account will bust if price reaches around the $14.35 area.

CHIPS for America subsection of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which became public law at the start of this year.

In their letter, members of the SIA stressed the need for government funding for semiconductor manufacturing and research. Apart from facilities operated by Intel Corporation, all of the latest chips sold by American companies are manufactured outside the U.S. on leading-edge 7nm and 5nm process nodes belonging either to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics's foundry arm Samsung Foundry.
ASML has a chance of getting interference in order to keep US manufacturing afloat.  We have stopped them from selling to China, if we can do that we can do the same for Taiwan.

c) Qualified Semiconductor Equipment.‚ÄîFor purposes of this section, the term ‚Äòqualified semiconductor equipment‚Äô means any property‚Äî

‚Äú(1) which has been identified by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, as machinery or equipment that is designed and used to‚Äî

‚Äú(A) manufacture or process semiconductors, or

‚Äú(B) perform research with respect to semiconductors,

‚Äú(2) which is placed in service in the United States by the taxpayer, and

‚Äú(3) with respect to which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable.

Massive tax breaks and funding. Also major push to increase Euv tool consolidation and production.

INTEL CAN BUILD 5NM and will probably receive the bulk of the support.

While the NDAA's CHIPS section doesn't outright authorize $10 billion in taxpayer funds, it does mention the 3nm manufacturing node. Right now, the only American company with the equipment needed to produce 5nm chips is Intel, whose 5nm is thought to be comparable with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 3nm node ‚Äì for which TSMC's already started plant construction. (Arizona, 2024 open date)

These laws  make their way into the NDAA through Section 9906 titled 'Advanced Microelectronics Research and Development'. Part (c) of this section directs the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to establish a National Semiconductor Technology Center. This will be dedicated to developing and prototyping advanced chip technologies for securing the American domestic chip supply chain through a public-private partnership.

Back during the onset of covid, Bob Swan wrote a letter to the DODexplaining the need for a DOD backed foundry plant in the US to combat China. The primary purpose is to build secure micro electronics under the complete auspices of the US military. This would cement INTEL as the defacto chip supplier for the US and its military allies. This also means labor would be subsidized in part by the DOD.

While the CHIPS title expands the federal government's focus on reclaiming the chip crown for America, it isn't the first such program. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Electronic Resurgence Initiative is another program that aims to develop key chip technologies domestically.

British design house Arm Ltd. is a beneficiary of this program, through which the company will provide access to all of its commercial chip design architecture and intellectual properties for DARPA use. Arm is currently subject to an acquisition attempt by NVIDIA, with multiple companies across the U.S. having objected to the deal, as they join their counterparts in the United Kingdom and China, citing fears of anticompetitive behavior.

[american-semiconductor-manufacturing In talks with biden](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/tech/american-semiconductor-manufacturing-biden/index.html)
Biden is expected to sign an executive order in the coming weeks to ""undertake a comprehensive review of supply chains for critical goods,"" including semiconductors, Psaki said.

The Information Technology Industry Council, an IT trade group, sent a similar [letter to Biden](https://www.itic.org/documents/general/ITICHIPSActLettertoPresidentBiden_Feb2021.pdf) this week, calling on him to include ""substantial funding"" for the CHIPS Act as part of his budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year.

Such advice could be instructive when the Biden administration carries out its review of semiconductor supply chains ‚Äî part of the planned executive order Psaki said will be signed in the coming weeks.

""The review will be focused on identifying the immediate actions we can take, from improving the physical production of those items in the US to working with allies to develop a coordinated response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers,"" Psaki said.
## A critical industry both for technology and defense
Psaki's comments, and the industry leaders' letter to Biden, come during a critical global shortage of semiconductors.

The ban on using Chinese companies electronic devices or products was so strict contracts where being threatened with being voided if there was a single Chinese built security camera. This means in order to combat china the US government has to back Intel's eventual dominance over Asia. Intel  cannot fail.. Intel has the greatest chance of success in America of taking Asia on, it cannot fail. There have been increasing articles about Intel being Necessary to national security and continued US global dominance. There are other American manufacturers that will benefit from this deal as well.

The second part I would like to bring up is Intel has a new CEO starting tomorrow.  Bringing his own team on board. 2 Intel veterans returning to teach them how it's done. And 1 Vm ware heavy Hitter.

 For those that want a sense of who he is, listen to Intel last earnings call [https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call](https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call) . The man has a PLAN. He studied under the greats of intel. Royce Moore and Grove, I'm pretty sure it was all 3 but I could be wrong. He rise through the ranks from technician to Chief Technology officer . His rise was meteoric. He is the hope of Intel. He was shaping intel's culture in its heyday, he knows how to recreate the Intel of old.

Curiously A lot of Vps have left the company. headcount was reduced using..... interesting methods. The fiefdoms have and are being broken up. after Murthy left his entire position was kind of removed and everyone who reported to him now reported to the CEO directly. The power struggles are NOT being tolerated anymore. just one company. Help wherever needed. if it needs to be done right you do it right. No question, Efficiency is king.

The third point I would like to bring up is Intel recent purchase of Israeli company Habana Labs. They are producing a product that allows machine learning to occur with GPU's at faster speeds than NVIDIA can. (Disclaimer I might be misquoting the article and over simplified it) No one has been able to make a dent in Nvidia like this before. Not the article that I had in mind but here's one [Gaudi Gaudi yall](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3)

[intel-ext-generation-leader](https://www.gfmag.com/magazine/february-2021/intel-next-generation-leader)

High-performance chip competition from ARM, Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA threatens Intel, which is hoping that Gelsinger‚Äîformerly its Chief Technology Officer  and later head of software maker VMware‚Äîwill bring greater innovation and help it regain market share in a changing environment.

‚ÄúIntel‚Äôs biggest challenge is to improve its execution of its ‚Äòleading edge‚Äô manufacturing as it has fallen behind TSMC and Samsung,‚Äù says Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. ‚ÄúIt also needs to drive adoption of its new Habanera machine-learning training chip, Habana, to better compete with NVIDIA.‚Äù
The market for deep-learning chipsets is predicted to burgeon from $6.6 billion in 2018 to $91.2 billion by 2025, according to market research firm, Valuates Reports. NVIDIA is the market-leading producer of graphics processing units optimized for training AI and deep-learning models that can process multiple computations simultaneously.

But Intel is already beginning to cut into NVIDIA‚Äôs lead. In December, Intel announced that Habana‚Äôs Gaudi processors will power Amazon Web Services‚Äô Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for machine learning workload, rewarding Intel‚Äôs 2019 acquisition of Habana.
Intel will be making significant gains in the AI Market 

Intel also has a new Discrete Graphics card lineup coming online this year that will give them an edge, it's a nice way to profit off your competitors inability to produce its own gpus.

Its being built by TSMC allowing INTEL to compete in that market early.

The loss of product leadership. It matters.......to a point. How we classify our chips ie, 7nm 5nm and the like is kind of archaic. What actually matters is transistor density. It doesn't matter that you can build chips at 7 or 5nm the space is subjective to who built it. Intel  has a record of having a higher transistor density than its competitors.

[Naming coinvention for Process nodes](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)
INTEL is not that far behind process wise. We can innovate too. If you use transistor density it puts the process differences in a different light
In a recent paper, researchers suggest that semiconductor companies should ditch the loosely defined transistor gate length as a measure of technological advancement (i.e 7nm or 14nm), and instead focus on transistor density. That's near-enough the same metric Intel's been proposing for years now, but this time it's also tacitly supported by Intel's greatest rival, TSMC.
Well, one researcher from TSMC The paper is titled ""A Density Metric for Semiconductor Technology,"" and can be found in [Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 108, no. 4, pp. 478-482, April 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714) (via [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/266351/researchers-propose-new-density-metric-for-semiconductor-technology)). It's nine authors hail from Stanford, MIT, ¬†Berkeley, and TSMC. Within the team posit that a change is required to standardize the advances in semiconductor lithographic manufacturing technology across the industry.

[intel 14nm AMD TSNC 7nm transistors micro compared](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145645-intel-14nm-amdtsmc-7nm-transistors-micro-compared/)

Having looked at the above comparison, and highlighted it in his video, der8auer challenges the obvious conclusion that Intel 14nm+++ and TSMC 7nm are very similar in physical scale, reminding viewers that the above pictures don't fully represent the 3D structure that is so important to modern chip optimisation. Moreover, the relationship between node size, half-pitch, and gate length has significantly loosened since the early 1990s. The XXnm figure reflects process history more than progress, asserts the OC expert, and thus it isn't very useful as a metric to compare between chip makers.
 probably something worth closer consideration is transistor density, as revealed by the chip fabricators. Intel 10 nm and TSMC 7nm processes both produce dies with approx 90 million transistors per sq millimetre. Moving forward both Intel and TSMC are targeting approx 150MT/mm¬≤ for their upcoming 7nm and 5nm processes, respectively. Again though, other factors make differences, like transistor type and chip architecture, that make direct comparisons difficult. 
The node size is an approximation transistor density is the metric that should be used. 
[is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/21/is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise/)

When it comes to manufacturing technology, we‚Äôre taught that smaller transistors are better. They switch faster and use less power. They take up less space, carving out room for more cores, more cache, and ultimately better performance. And when foundries can fit more dies onto the same sized silicon wafer, costs go down. It‚Äôs no surprise that the technology world anticipates each process shrink with bated breath.
Today, node names largely represent generational progress. They don‚Äôt reflect gate length; the pitch, width, or height of modern field-effect transistor (FET) fins; or even transistor density. It‚Äôs consequently difficult to cut through the marketing and compare competing process technologies based on their names.  But because Intel struggled to bring 10nm to production, the company must now endure contrasts between its 10nm transistors and the 7nm nodes from TSMC and Samsung. Fortunately for Intel, the 10nm node holds its own, even though naming suggests otherwise. Heavy investment into beefing up 10nm helped Intel facilitate[ a \~2.7x density improvement over 14nm](https://newsroom.intel.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/09/10-nm-icf-fact-sheet.pdf), packing more than 100 million transistors into a square millimeter of die area.

The second part of this is Intel's manufacturing capabilities.

There's a shortage of Intel's competitors chips. TSMC can't build what AMD needs to actually make a dent in intel's revenue stream. The same goes for NVIDIA but IMO to a lesser degree. The third part of this is the massive shortage of IC chips in general, in particular the auto industry. This means Intel will hit 70 within a month or so maybe less. This also means IMHO there's no end price target  if the foundry plant comes online in a few years. I love Intel i'm not giving investment advice, I'm just betting on a few hair brained ideas and the innovation and Indomitable spirit this company has the  the grit and the wear withal to hold until it can play catch up.

 Bob Swan did great with what he knew how to do. He gave Intel cash and was the bad news bear so the new CEO could have a clean record And to clear out some of the clutter and take the flak for it. 

Intel and American chip manufacturering will soon see a rise that will allow them gain traction against Asian rivals. With the Instability of  Taiwan The DOD could very likely back Intel over tsmc Just to prevent a scenario where China could extend influence on how if or what we received from Tsmc. As stated above, there are certain situations where China has been aggressive  of late. Would you want the possibility of your high end chip manufacturing to be shut off overnight?
INTEL SOLD NAND.
 within a few years the transfer will be complete and jntel will be mostly divested from those businesses.

Please Give me any advice where I could improve

TLDR: INTC will  exceed expectations  and American manufacturing will get a much needed boost under the biden administration.

Lastly my positions

I'm buying more on Thursday or Friday since INTEL is the only American company able to produce 5NM chips  INTEL will receive the lions share of the assistance. Imo that makes more sense

These views are mine and mine alone and this isn't investment advice.


Tldr: Intc has a high chance of regaining process leadership by government
backed programs. Mostly the chip act. 
This also creates a research and development hub that has industry and state backed entities. Creating hybrid private public entity.  American chip manufacturing has the complete backing of the US government and public funding that will give Intel which is the most advanced American chip maker the edge and tools necessary to regain process leadership. In the next few months we will see intel has been significantly undervalued compared to its competitors. 

Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.
