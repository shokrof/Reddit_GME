Mystic mac prediction is in.

Well done retards, you wiped $3t of wealth off of the market in just under a week!

Now if I was Mr. Wallstreet I would be pretty pissed, some have had to close their long positions to account for the losses. Not only did you make them loose their shorts, you made them loose their potential future gainz from those positions in ""the big dip"".

I'm going to be rational here and say this isn't sustainable. I'm just as retarded as you guys so this isn't advice but it's like having a gangbanging a pretty blonde with 6 million black dudes, eventually someone's gotta pull out. There's a LOT of new blood here, about 2 million and people are absolutely ecstatic right now. Any seasoned retard here will know how these things end.

My prediction next week:-

 Market's go off their fuckin nut. Bubbles go up a gear and we see multiple moons a day. People are going to get fuk in volatility, gainz porn will quickly turn to loss porn and tendies will be swiped. If GME weakens it will be the beginning, the hedge funds will place their bets and all these rookies will chase red.

Another BIG Wall Street Inefficiency - Why Callaway $ELY will go to the moon soon 🚀🚀🚀🚀,0,l9el6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9el6l/another_big_wall_street_inefficiency_why_callaway/,70,1612136097.0,"First off, I cannot thank everyone in this sub enough. About 30 days ago, I made my first GameStop post, followed by some DDs. And well, we can see that everyone who listened was rewarded like crazy. Before you ask, yes, I am still holding $GME - and so should you! GME is a great value stock as we can be sure that Ryan Cohen and his team will take advantage of these positive news and make the company more successful than ever before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ym2wc98soe61.jpg?width=613&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18aa87cae490ba9f6265217996d48833a48209e6

Having that said, I am posting once again today with a different stock, that was mentioned in here a few times but should have been way more prevalent. Not the next $GME but it will go flying as well:

# CALLAWAY ($ELY) - Undervalued like crazy...

ℹ️ *General Information*:

* Callaway ($ELY - named after the autistic founder's first name) is a company with $2.5 billion market cap, huge growth potential and an absurdly undervalued stock price
* Revenue: $1.7 billion + $1.1 billion for TopGolf pre-merger (2019)
* Revenue growth of 30% YOY
* USPGA has reported a 1,700% growth in participation among young people in the past decade
* Over 500 Million rounds of golf were played in the U.S. in the past year
* 98% of golf courses remained open for play during the pandemic and only about 9% reported a decrease in total tee time bookings

&#x200B;

⚡ *Short Information (decent squeezing possible)*

* Nearly $500 million dollar shorted
* 1.9 Million trading volume on Friday
* 18.3% short float

&#x200B;

📅 *News*:

* Callaway recently acquired TopGolf (one of the most successful entertainment venues during the pandemic) -- This alone should make Callaway worth $2.5 billion+
* PT was recently raised to $40; analysts have been going crazy
* Golf has never before seen a faster growth rate than in the past 12 months. Why? People are looking for a fun, safe way to be outside... plus we are seeing more and more younger people starting to play golf. It is not only an old+rich guy sport anymore
* Jon Rahm, a golf professional ranked first by the Official World Golf Ranking in 2020, signed a multi-year equipment deal with $ELY and reportedly is playing better than ever before thanks to their advanced equipment
* Callaway just announced new products, including a soft golf ball with increased control technology, and new drivers/fairway woods
* [PGA.com](https://PGA.com) reported that Callway Epic (part of their new products) is built for speed and may be a game changer for many people in the $70 billion industry

&#x200B;

**Here is the most important thing besides the huge misvaluation in the equipment sales:**

**$ELY acquired TopGolf with revenues of $1.1 billion for an absurdly low price bc worries about the pandemic impact. Turns out that these worries were unsubstantiated...** u/PlatNoFeatures **described it well: ""Topgolf is operating at a better capacity to pre-covid thanks to the spread-out open bay layout they use. Further, it licenses its ball tracing tech to other driving ranges, and this revenue stream is up 200%+ yoy""**

&#x200B;

🔮 Now, why is this important? Earnings are coming up and the firm is simply undervalued by Wall Street. Once again, it is up to us to fix what they are breaking and taking advantage of...

Note: As always, please be aware of your risk in trading stocks and always do your do diligence. But 🚀🚀🚀🚀

TLDR; $ELY is an undervalued firm which recently acquired TopGolf. Low volume, more Wall Street autism and decent short float will make this stock fly around earnings (Feb 8th). T-8 days to launch, get strapped in ASAP 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Positions: 200 shares, 35 $30c 2/19 (also still 190 shares $GME in case you are wondering)

Edit: Since most of you are too retarded to read full paragraphs: no, I’m not saying to sell $GME, and no this is not the next AMC or GME. But it still has a lot of potential to make you a bunch of money nonetheless

Edit 2: For all retards, $ELY is doing to golf what the rich don’t want to see. They are turning it into a game for anyone with TopGolf.",2021-02-01 01:34:57

It seems the prevailing sentiment right now is all about sticking it to Wall St - even if it means losing money. While I can empathize with that, that is not what this sub *was* all about. 

This sub was mostly about making money through risky bets - everything else be damned.  

In early 2020, the majority on this sub bet the pandemic would ruin the economy (thereby costing people jobs) -  a lot of us made money. Around late spring, the sentiment changed - the majority on this sub went bullish and again made a lot of money. Sentiment changed daily during the trade war with China. 

While there might've been some animus against Wall St, that was not the motivation - it was money and unbridled greed. But it feels like some are now embarrassed to admit this.

This sub has grown massively in the last week and if the majority now wants it to be about taking a stand and sticking it to Wall St - so be it.  

But know that the GME situation is very likely a once in a decade (or even lifetime) occurrence. For a lot of us, this is the only opportunity to make a lot of money quickly. And while it would be great if a short squeeze happens, no one knows for certain what will happen - a lot of posts are just regurgitating weeks to months old data and DD. So if you are just getting in now, bet only what you can afford to lose. 

One last thing - whatever happens, for the love of god, please switch from Robinhood after the dust settles. Our nemesis has a good thread on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8nntv/by_popular_demand_official_i_hate_robinhood_and/

GME squeezing can be continued, but our true mission at this point in financial history is to accomplish what the Hunt Brothers and Warren Buffet both tried and failed to do. (I will explain why and who stopped them). RH will only allow you to buy one share of GME anyway, dump the rest in silver. This is a once in a century setup, the size of which you pea sized brains can't even fucking comprehend, and by the end of the post hopefully you will understand the thesis is and why it will take a lot less to set this off than you think.

Think about it, what are the odds WSB just stumbled on the juiciest short in the market? GME showed us the retard strength that we possess. Now that we know the effect we could have, our mission for maximum tendies is to squeeze the short that the boomers have known and been bitching about about for decades now - the ancient shiny metal. GME was just foreplay, strap in retards. This can literally be world changing. We can fix the monetary system and end the lies. We can set off the largest wealth transfer in history simply by squeezing the banks that have been making billions manipulating the paper price of silver for decades.

**TL;DR: Read the fucking post.** I wrote this shit on my only day off without any of my Adderall because this is that important. Read it, it wont take longer than 10 mins. It is important you understand the full thesis and the evidence behind everything. This is not a YOLO, this is a tactical plan with the necessary mechanical triggers in place to set off the biggest squeeze of this planet's history.

^(TL;DR - okay fine you lazy retards, to set off the biggest short squeeze of a lifetime (many many many times that of GME buy PSLV if you want to buy an ETF, SLV 4/16 35 calls if you want to stay with the spirit of WSB, Futures and take delivery if any of you have deep tendie pockets, and physical bullion from bullion dealers like))[ ^(this)](https://goldsilver.com/)^(. Paper market is 250x times the physical market, this squeeze has been talked about by silver market experts for quite some time.)

# Intro

I've been seeing a lot of posts on this sub lately about targeting silver as the next massive short squeeze. All are calling for the right thing, but the thesis has not been fully or properly laid out. I am here to set the record straight once and for all. Use this post as the summary of the thesis.

I'll get right into it. There are a lot of reasons to own silver. You've heard a lot of them. Money printing, silver being at the lowest relative valuation that it's ever been in history, inflation, QE, demand from the green electrification trend, the whole lot. Check out[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7zzg0/silver_an_undervalued_inflation_hedge_with_short/) for a good overview of the inflation thesis. See also[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gl0n1mm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and[ this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/). All of those reasons are all very valid and solid reasons to own silver. I've been stacking silver for more than a year now. If you want to read about those reasons, you're free to do so on your own. **But let's cut the shit and get to the only reason that matters to WSB here, - THE GREAT BIG SHORT.** Price target? If I'm being honest, I don't have a clue. Somewhere really fucking high. First stop will be $50. Then $100. Then once the fires really light up and losses for the banks mount, who the fuck knows where it ends up. North of 1k per ounce? We will see. GME being $400 seemed impossible, and this is VASTLY bigger.

# The Short

First of all, let's get this straight, the short is not speculation. It is a fact, and has been well documented and talked about for decades. There have been actual fucking books about it, fittingly titled[ The Big Silver Short: How The Wall Street Banks Have Left The Silver Market In Place For The Short-Squeeze Of A Lifetime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54252490-the-big-silver-short). In the book, aspects of the shorts are confirmed by some of the most reputable names in the precious metals business. There are accounts from Bart Chilton (CFTC chairman who personally handed JPM a waiver to reduce their silver short position, but JPM made it even bigger), Keith Neumeyer (AG CEO), Ted Butler, Andrew Maguire, Craig Hemke, among others who document the size of the short, silver price manipulation tactics, how the silver market really operates, physical silver shortages back in '08, why the banks have been able to continue this for so long, and past attempts at squeezing the bank (more on this later), etc. It's a great book, and if you want a whole ass book full of confirmation bias after buying shitloads of silver on Monday open, you should give it a read (yes I know you fucks don't have attention spans, but it's right up your alley, manipulations, corruption, bank greed, the lot. Do some research if you don't believe any of the facts I've stated here). (The current short, as calculated by Ted Butler is 75,604 contracts (378 million oz).

# Price Manipulations

In short, COMEX is operating a fractional (read fraudulent) reserve system. What that means in plain terms is, there are many many times more futures contracts than there are physical silver in COMEX vaults. **The paper market is estimated by most to be somewhere between 200-250x the size of the physical market.** Why is price manipulating so profitable for the banks? It's stunningly simple, and can be observed with your own eyes 1-2 times per week mildly, and the once every 1-2 months full sized price smash (where the price moves 4%+ in the middle of the night. I have watched this numerous times with my own eyes over the last year. While already sitting on a massive short, during off hours, when liquidity is at it's absolute thinnest, the crooked banks (JPM, Scotiabank, GS, Deutche, et. all) smash the price down by selling COMEX futures contracts. When the market opens deep in the red, that prompts algos and managed money traders to sell, with the banks gladly covering their shorts from early at a lower price. These are not allegations, CFTC has recently stepped their game up, coming down on[ JPM](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1320576/download) and[ Scotia](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bank-nova-scotia-agrees-pay-604-million-connection-commodities-price-manipulation-scheme) for gold and silver price spoofing and both signed deferred prosecution agreements as a result. In plain English, it's a slap on the wrist, compliance program+fine but if papa JPM and Scotia misbehave in the next 2 years, daddy CFTC gets to absolutely fuck them up by prosecuting them criminally. The result? Despite what everyone is claiming on here and on twitter, JPM has completely closed their short position, and is now sitting on a fucking MOUNTAIN of physical silver. (this was the short position JPM inherited from Bear Sterns, later confirmed by Bart Chilton). Contrary to what you probably have heard, JPM is currently floating around around flat to slightly long in both metals. The DPA resulted in Scotia fully exiting their precious metals business. However, that changed absolutely nothing in the COMEX, don't you worry - the 8 other big shorts more that picked up the slack, and the latest combined big 8 NET short position in silver is a total of 75,604 contracts (378 million oz). This is a fact, not speculation, there should be no debate here. This is it, this is the ONLY reason silver is this cheap on a relative basis.

# The Squeeze

*Yes but* [u/TripleKNotToday](https://www.reddit.com/u/TripleKNotToday/)\*, the silver market is $1.5T! We can't ever move that market! GME Mcap was a billion when we started!\*

The only, the **ONLY** thing that matters here is the amount of COMEX silver, aka 1000oz bars. Silver prices are set on a razor thin market. Due to its use in a wide variety of industrial applications, so much silver has been used up and consumed over the past century that only an incredibly small amount remains in world inventories. In that key form of 1000 oz bars, the industry and investment standard form – the form that ultimately determines the price – only two million of these bars exist (2 billion ounces) and more than 75% or one and a half million bars (1.5 billion oz) are held in the world’s silver ETFs and COMEX warehouses and, therefore, are not thought to be available, except at much higher prices. **The total value of all the 2 billion oz of silver in 1000 oz bar form is worth only $50 billion.** (Yes, there is more silver in the world in forms than exist in 1000 oz bar form, but that silver is closely held by millions of individual investors and there are no signs of any “melt” into 1000 oz bar form and has, therefore, no real effect on the supply of 1000 oz bars).

**The marketcap of b1tc0ln is $600 billion, and you don't think we can an effect on the price of something with an effective marketcap of $50 billion?? In COMEX vaults (the stuff backing the concentrated futures short), there are \~400 million oz or just** ***$10 billion.***

Ted Butler calculated that as of last week, an 8$ move in silver results in $3 billion in losses for the 8 big shorts. Those are *massive* losses. The pain point will not be when silver runs to $50 an ounce. The pain point is *ANY* movement upwards.

# Our Effect So Far

Still skeptical we can move the price and hurt the banks? Okay, let's recap what happened during the past week. Silver posts first started popping up on Thursday, so this effectively only captures 2 days worth of our retard strength (let's be real, everyone is still focused on GME, so only a small fraction of our retard strength had these effects).

On Friday alone, **SLV added 37 million shares**, or 1150 metric tons or 36,973,358 oz. That is **equivalent to \~10% of the registered inventory backing the entirety of the COMEX silver futures contracts**. IN ONE DAY. (Still think we can't move this bitch?)

Similarly on Friday, **PSLV traded 5x their normal volume.**

**Bullion dealers worldwide are experiencing sharp shortages,** [already](https://twitter.com/QTRResearch/status/1355898843485724673?s=09). APMEX [halted trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/l95moq/apmex_has_halted_all_silver_sales/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) until futures are to open

*Wait, hold on. If 10% of the entire COMEX inventory flowed into SLV, why was the price increase so low? Silver was only up 7% over that time? Where does SLV even get that much metal? Your thesis is shit.*

Here is where it gets interesting. Literally, the only bank with that much physical silver on hand is....JP Morgan. Quite literally no other bank has as much silver as them, and if you remember, JPM is *NOT* short in the futures market. JPM is sitting on a fucking MASSIVE pile of silver, and effectively flat in futures.

Almost certainly, JPM leased that metal to SLV, which is just another form of short selling, designed to keep a lid on the price. Translated to plain English, JPM is leasing out as much metal to SLV as it needs, in order to suppress the price in the short run. The only conceivable reason the authorized participants would sell so aggressively at such low prices and further compound their position by going out and borrowing physical metal to back the shares is to prevent silver and SLV prices from rising. Think about it, if you had a bunch of silver and SLV needed it, why would you lease it to them, knowing that you could demand a higher price? You would do so if you had a *VERY* vested interest in keeping the price down. This is exactly what the big shorts are doing in SLV, selling new shares and borrowing more metal to deposit promptly in order to prevent a run on silver (literally what banks used to do in the 30s when a bank run would begin - very quickly redeem all claims as to pretend there is no problem). But at best, it’s only a band-aid approach that might succeed in the very short term (days or weeks) of preventing prices from exploding this week, but actually further ensures the eventual price explosion.

Look, long story short the banks are fucking **terrified** of us, and we came completely out of left field and caught them by surprise. The banks added heavily to their short this week to aid the price suppression further. All of the abovementioned happened with 99% of this subreddit still focused on GME. It does not matter how much you have, ANY silver buying will help. Whatever dry powder you have left. WSB can set this off with probably a third of this sub piling into silver, if not less. Once this gets going, look out.

# Hunt Brothers + Warren Buffett

*""If the silver short is so obvious, why has nobody attempted to squeeze it yet?""*

They have. Numerous times. And they were stopped. Sure most of you probably heard the name ""Hunt Brothers"" but the Buffet Silver story is probably a new one.

In the late ’70s, the Hunts figured out that the supply of silver on the COMEX was less than the amount of silver futures representing that supply. A silver contract is 5,000 ounces, and there was more open interest in silver contracts than there was silver in the COMEX vaults. So they decided to start buying silver futures and asking for delivery. The powers on Wall Street and in DC, and the people running the COMEX realized they had a problem, and the price went from $5 to $50 very quickly. Essentially, the regulators accused them of cornering the market, and they were instructed to unload their silver futures position. The COMEX imposed a regulation for a time that if you were going to trade silver on the COMEX, all you could do was sell. That was to get the price down because the Hunt brothers had asked for delivery of silver. They literally just changed exchange rules to liquidation only because they knew they could not deliver. And boom, the price goes from $50 to $20 in a matter of 2 months.

^((Fun fact, back then the silver/gold ratio was 16:1, while now it's 70:1, primarily a function of how far lower the banks have been able to push the silver market due to its smaller size. Think about how undervalued that is. At one of its peaks,) **^(silver hit $50 in 1980. Today it is at $27.)** ^(That is all in nominal terms. That is fucking \*insane\*)**^(.)** ^(Name me one asset on the planet that's 25% cheaper now than it was in 1980? Silver is heavily \*undervalued\*, the price is) *^(not)* ^(coming back down after the squeeze comes. This is a fundamentally different, more advanced play. This is a fucking rocket. We are catching banks with their pants down at the bottom of the launch pad))

Warren Buffett suffered a similar fate. He was the chairman of Salomon Brothers at the time, and he was going to corner the market with a guy named Jimmy DiPiazza (a broker at Philipp Brothers, which was part of Salomon Brothers). They've gone heavily long in silver contracts, and all of a sudden it closed way below that price (COMEX crooks working their magic). They were going to take delivery and force the price up. Accounts vary for what happened next. Some assert that Buffet got the stick - they got a call from the government telling them “you either get out of this market right away or you’re going to be audited the rest of your life in everything else you do."" Some claim Buffett got the carrot instead of the stick - he got himself in trouble with General Re, a reinsurance company that he bought that was involved with a lot of fraud, and Buffett was caught in the middle of it. The story goes that the banksters and the criminals went to Buffett cut a deal essentially saying “Hey, we’ll let you out of this General Re problem if you give us all that physical silver you have.” So Buffett gets out of General Re, and the banks got the physical silver and started the silver ETF “SLV.”

The accounts on why vary, but point being that one way or another Buffet was forced to sell all of his silver to the crooked banks.

# Why We are Different

By now I think it's becoming clear why the Hunt Brothers and Buffet failed while we are in the best possible position to succeed. They can go after one person cornering the market. They cannot stop an army of 6 million autists. We are decentralizing the process, and we have more momentum than ever. The banks have made billions manipulating the price of silver. It's time we fight back. #silversqueeze is trending on Twitter (even the Winkelvoss twins are the latest biggest name). All of FinTwit is talking about this. The boomers are getting involved because they understand silver and have heard about the short several times (also many of them have been stacking silver for decades, and are sure as shit not selling into the run up they've been waiting 20+ years for). This is the time to fight back. You have the chance to be a part of history, while making yourself filthy rich.

# Okay, enough bullshit. Just tell me what to buy.

Glad you asked.

**For the WSB natives**, probably the most effective option - **SLV calls**. Up to you what strike price and how far out. Start with **4/16, 30 calls**, but can move the strike higher for more tendies, and/or can buy them further out. This call buying will still gamma squeeze the Market Makers, forcing them to first delta hedge (buying SLV to hedge), and when price moves to the upside, gamma squeeze them (more SLV buying), all resulting in SLV shares to be bought as hedges. Mechanically, such buying mandates the buying of physical silver at the end of the ""chain"", despite still widespread misgivings about the silver ETFs. Look no further than the massive deposit into SLV on Friday.

**For the newcomers,** risk averse ones of the bunch who don't have the balls to fuck with options or your brokerage won't let you, **buy PSLV** (PSLV is a physical silver ETF. 1 share of the ETF=a fixed # of silver OZ, **fully allocated** in Sprott's warehouses.) It's run by Eric Sprott, the most honest and well respected name in the business. If you're wrong, nobody in your family will give you shit for buying silver, it is known as the safest investment alongside gold. Boomers know and understand precious metals. They used them as money. **You have the chance to invest into asymmetric returns to the upside by buying one the safest assets known to man.** Even better if you buy physical bullion (this nearly broke COMEX back in march when there was simply no physical around).[ goldsilver.com](https://goldsilver.com/) or[ shiffgold.com](https://shiffgold.com/) for US,[ silvergoldbull.ca](https://silvergoldbull.ca/) for Canada. Put pressure on the silver market in any way you can, it does not matter. If you buy PSLV, Sprott's team will be buying physical silver to put in their warehouse. If you buy silver from any bullion dealer, guess what, that dealer has to buy more silver from mints, competing for silver than could go into 1000 oz bars.

EDIT: From LongWave Investing on Twitter - ""**For my fellow Eurofags**, **here's a list of physically backed #silversqueeze ETCs**: iShares Physical Silver ETC ISIN IE00B4NCWG09 WisdomTree Physical Silver ISIN DE000A0N62F2 Xtrackers Physical Silver ETC (EUR) ISIN DE000A1E0HS6 ""

**For those of you with deep pockets, buy silver futures and take delivery.**

# Conclusion

Let's get this shit done fellas. The banks will continue to fight this to their death, because the losses will be astronomical. They will short heavier than ever before. They will throw the kitchen sink at this. Fraudulent lending of silver to each other will continue, but this will only be digging them into a deeper hole. **The price volatility will be massive. That's how you will be able to tell that this is working. Buying certain ETFs will be banned. When that happens, buy any physical silver ETF out there (**[**PSLV.TO**](https://pslv.to/) **on the TSX,**[ **MNS.TO**](https://mns.to/) **among others). If that fails, buy physical bullion. If you're located in Europe, google around and find silver bullion dealers. Physical premiums will be high (15-20%), but that just shows how, manipulated the paper price is. I am seeing many dealers already sell out of silver inventory, that's how tiny this market is. Focus on squeezing the metal, not the stonks. The silver stonks will follow on their own, they trade like silver on steroids. But silver needs to be what sets off the move. Even if silver opens at +6%, just remember you are still getting in on the ground floor of this rocket. Silver is where GME was a couple of weeks ago.**

**Let's take back everything we've lost though currency debasement ever since the FED was established. Take back everything we've lost from the inflation tax of money printing. You know you can't afford to buy a house while an auto shop manager in the 70s could buy a house with 2 years salary? Let's take back everything we've missed out due to low interest rates inflating asset bubbles in all markets. One shitty hedge fund isn't shit. Let's take back our financial independence and hit the big boys. Let's take back all the profits the banks were able to generate by blatantly manipulating the silver market for decades. Lets squeeze these motherfuckers, fixing the wealth distribution in the process.**

# Recommendation Summary

In order of largest impact

* Buy 4/16 35 calls on SLV (or any other similar OTM calls)
* Buy futures and take delivery (be careful with this one, the contracts have an FM clause allowing them to cash settle at the previous close price. Great for squeezing the banks, not the best for going all in)
* Buy PSLV, or any physical silver ETF that is available to you (google search what's avail on the exchanges you have access to). And/or buy silver bullion from any bullion dealers.",2021-02-01 02:51:57

Switching brokers is exactly what hedge funds and billionaires want us to do,44,l9gio8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9gio8/switching_brokers_is_exactly_what_hedge_funds_and/,43,1612141478.0,"TL;DR: Billionaires and hedge funds losing money in GME is fine when all the money the retail investors made comes back to their own bank. 


It seems everyone wants to switch to fidelity now. Just a thought beforehand:

In the previous thread where they laid out good/neutral/bad brokers  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/) there was a trend:

Good brokers: enormous banks that had their own clearing houses.

Neutral: new smaller sized brokers who didn’t have their own clearing house but weren’t required to stop moving stocks.

Bad brokers: newer brokers who originated 0 commissions and options trades, with a large userbase doing highly speculative investing. All of which said that their clearing house required them to stop trading certain securities. 

If you really believe that the new brokers who’s entire business model was giving power to the retail investor  intentionally colluded to keep you out, by all means switch over to the LARGEST bank in the world. 

Realize that all the “good brokers” on that list are all the institutions you claim to be fighting against. 

In reality the “bad brokers” aren’t the largest banks in the world and have to follow rules. Giving up on them after they got us this far seems unfair to me. The problem is that they have a large userbase doing highly speculative investing, and their clearing house made them follow the laws SEC put forth. 

With that knowledge, by all means go leave the platforms that got us here for the largest banks in the world. That’s exactly what they want you to do. Go back to the platforms that charge commissions after they forced the free platforms to stop trading stocks. I wonder who owns all the clearing houses that made the $0 commission apps stop trading....

If you’re going to claim we’re playing 4D chess don’t assume the guys who’ve been doing this longer aren’t playing the same game.

I was formerly on the Bernie campaign - hear me out - this is reminding me of a certain time right before super Tuesday; before the establishment fucked us in the ass and drove our campaign into a death spiral. We were just as determined and ripe with conviction. 

As you might recall in the democratic presidential primary, Bernie did the unprecedented and won the first four states (fuck you Buttigieg) which had never been done before. He had an incredible lead in delegates, and had the race maintained there is no doubt the progressive vote would have remained united while the moderate vote fractured among several candidates. Under those conditions, I have strong reasons to suspect Bernie would have won the primary.

Obviously electoral politics and finance are two separate things, but the lesson is clear: They spent the entire weekend planning, plotting, breaking rules, calling their powerful friends in the cabal, and working against you. Just like they did the weekend before super Tuesday, when Obama called up the rest of the moderates in the primary, offered them clout and money, before appointing Biden as the de-facto president of the United States.

Be prepared. Tomorrow, and furthermore this week, do not be surprised to encounter maneuvers you would not have thought of before - do not be surprised when they break the rules, perform blatant collusion, and wholesale corruption. Don't get cocky, we have our work to do, and above all else,

1) Make an account at a backup broker. DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES AT YOUR CURRENT BROKER NO MATTER WHAT. Simply transfer money into another broker and continue buying WHATEVER STOCK YOU LIKE. I will be buying GME because I LOVE THE STOCK. 

2) HOLD (fuck you automod for removing the original word.)

We’ve not only changed the game for the little guys but we’ve improved the lives of many individuals, including myself. 

I invested in GME when it was $9 because you batshit crazy motherfuckers told me to do so back late last year. So I took all my PLTR gains and dropped it in GME stock and diamond handed this bitch. Needless to say, it’s the best decision I ever made. I made more money than I ever thought I could make. It still doesn’t feel real knowing that when GME goes to $10,000 a share, I will have an 8 figure net worth. 

Being that I made some more cash with some good ROKU investments, I decided to liquidate it (since I’m GME diamond hands) and give back as part of our effort to show them that we are different from the rest, that we try to help eachother make some fucking tendies, and not ruin the little guys along the way. WE ARE THE ONES PROTECTING THE COMMON WORKER, AND WE ARE COMING FOR THE BIG DOGS.

So to get to the point, I’m a medical student in my last year of medical school going into cardiothoracic surgery. At my institution, we have one of the most world renowned pediatric cardiac surgeons in the world, and he just so happens to be one of my mentors. This past week I spoke to him about my willingness to give back to the world, and I gave him one of my ideas. I asked him if he would do pro-bono work on his end, on a couple of patients in need of heart surgery from around the world, if I would cover the hospital costs and the transportation of the children and their families, along with their housing and post-operative care. He instantly agreed (he is a good man). He advised me on how to go about doing all the administrative approvals and work. I did not want to write this until I got the OK from the institution, however, as of today I got the call for the green light. The projected costs I have to cover allow me to only be able to cover the costs of 2 of the surgeries, but at least it’s something. 

This week I will start reaching out to organizations to find two kids that the surgeon and I feel are in most dire need of heart surgery. When we find the candidates I will upload their stories and will keep all of you updated. You guys have truly moved me, and I would never have been able to do this without you guys.

If last week proved ANYTHING, it's that the system can decide when it wants to fuck us - and the free market - over. This has all the makings to be a once in a lifetime event. When all is said and done, we should all be extremely richer than we were in December.

**HOWEVER: THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SPEND MONEY YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.**

We are in completely uncharted territory now. We have no idea what happens from here. The maths says that we should see MOASS. But that does not mean you put in money that stops you from affording rent, food, or any other bare necessity for you or your family. 

**YOUR HEALTH AND WELLBEING COMES FIRST.**

You also don't want to be putting yourself into a position where you are constantly checking the charts, scared with sweaty palms every time you see a 5% drop, a 10% drop, or as we saw earlier this week, a 60%+ drop. This will cause you to have FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and paper hand. This WILL cause you a loss. 

**LOSSES ONLY MATERIALISE WHEN YOU SELL.**

So please, DO NOT spend money you do not have. DO NOT take out loans or CC debt just to put more on. If you play it smart with everyone else, only smart decisions will be made, and whatever happens, you can walk away happy.

**FINALLY, THE HIGHER CHANCE OF YOU PAPER HANDING, THE HIGHER CHANCE YOU FUCK IT UP FOR THE DIAMOND HANDS**

Firstly: 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀🌝

Now, down to business.

You have just been thrusted into a once in a lifetime phenomenon. It’s public knowledge now that the covid pandemic has increased the wealth of the world’s top 10 billionaires by over 30% (around $1 Trillion) and that the crisis has led to the largest transfer of wealth from poor to rich since 2008. Where do these billionaires keep their billions you might ask? No, not their JP Morgan savings account. Their money is managed by investment banks and hedgefunds. These same firms (Citadel, Melvin, Viking etc..) are now losing billions (around $70 billion as of last week) trying to short companies (profit from their failure). They have not yet been successful. 

WHERE DO WE COME INTO ALL OF THIS?

The reason GameStop hasn’t dropped in price despite the hedgefund’s best efforts is because the majority of the shares have been bought by retail investors (the little guy- you and me) and the hedgefunds need us to sell them in order to  buy and manage their short positions. The longer we hold out selling (and buy more), the more these hedgefunds will demand shares, pushing the price up (squeezing their short position). 

ARE YOU TOO LATE TO THE PARTY?

The stock is at around $300 right now. The short squeeze HASNT EVEN HAPPENED YET. It’s realistic that the stock could go to $5000+ per share. If the GME short squeeze in proportion reached the same comparable levels as the VW Porsche squeeze, GME stock could reach $30k+ per share.

This is our chance to reverse the wealth transfer that’s taken place due to the pandemic (and even 2008), and also make a statement that times have changed and we won’t stand for billionaires profiting off the downfall of businesses and destroying the little guy (15,000 people are out of a job if the hedgefunds win and GameStop goes under- that’s 15,000 people who are potentially the only source of income for an entire family).

When all is said and done, ask yourself- what side of history do you want to have been on? 

WHAT TO DO?

BUY. Every share not owned by the hedges loses them more money and drives the price up.
HOLD. They can’t cover if we don’t sell. This will also drive the price up.
BUY THE DIP. The stock will dip, this is natural and can be used to get in at a discount.
DONT SELL WHEN WE GET TO $1K+. It will be tempting, but you’ll kick yourself when it’s at $10k, $20k, $🌝k+

Do your own research, this is not financial advice, I am not an expert.

I. Just. Like. The. Stock 🚀

TAAT - Will this be the new GME successor?,0,la0z1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la0z1c/taat_will_this_be_the_new_gme_successor/,47,1612207355.0,"As some of you may know, Keith Gill, the 34 year old guy known as ""DeepF-ingValue"" from this forum was the driving force behing GME (1750% in 8 days!) who made the hedge fund owners despair and firmly ruined them.

After the GME story and Gill, we can take a closer look to his notes:

&#x200B;

[Source: The Wall Street Journal](https://preview.redd.it/mu0g6w6nkue61.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b490b08ff9655f2e29faeec23a37759df31998c)

If you zoom in on the picture, we find TAAT on the top of the list on the ticker symbols. TAAT is the specific or / TOBAF US symbol for the stock TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (NYSE: A2P6PR)

&#x200B;

[Zoom from the Original Notes](https://preview.redd.it/nv60mdqxkue61.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=861382304627b883cbe4f5a6f8687beb25b14c3b)

Probably not only I will zoom in on Keith Gill's list and check that TAAT stock. This information will surely make the rounds quickly. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the company published fantastic news shortly after the market closed before this weekend.

I did my own research (DYOR! anyway) but I think that TAAT has the tools to become a ""disruptor"". A company that can fundamentally change an entire industry, just as Tesla did in the automotive market and Beyond Meat in the food market.

They invented a cigarette that is used completely without tobacco and without nicotine, but should taste like a real cigarette. Market entry is not years away as some will be possible know: No, already rolled out in the state of Ohio.

Are Tesla and Beyon Meat correctly valued on the stock exchange per today? That can certainly be discussed. What is certain, however, is that they have the advantage of being the ""first mover"" in their sectors and they have changed them forever. Also at TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. I see this entry into the billion dollar tobacco industry. Therefore the statement from the CEO of TAAT ( SETTI COSCARELLA ) is by no means a pipe dream for us:

>""Anything under a 5 million dollar market value for TAAT would be a disappointment to me!""

If Tesla or Beyond Meat have too few similarities to TAAT ™, there is a very good example from this industry. Recently there was an IPO on the NYSE of a company with the relatively unimaginative name of RLX Technology Inc. (NYSE: RLX). The company develops and sells e-cigarettes and related products in China. The company will make about 160 million USD in profit in 2020, that's about 10 cents per share, which in turn results in a crisp P / E ratio of around 250!  Don't you also believe that the tobacco-free and therefore nicotine-free cigarette such as the TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) manufactures in a patent-pending process, could possibly be far more successful than a vile e-cigarette? If so, then one should use the P / E ratio of 250 to determine the value of TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) and can definitely consider this information. Only 10 million annual profits would justify a market value of 2.5 billion, which corresponds to a share price of almost 30 dollars and has moon potential. Sounds crazy, but it's true.

Check also this Breaking news: [60% of tobacco retailers who have carried taat for three or more weeks have placed REORDERS](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/TAAT:CNX/news/6968139025090006/60_of_Tobacco_Retailers_who_Have_Carried_TAATTM_for_Three_or_More_Weeks_Have_Placed_Reorders)

TAAT announces that approximately 60% of retailers who have sold TAAT ™ for three weeks or more have reordered at least once, with multiple reorders requesting greater quantities than the first time. TAAT ™ has been placed in around 1.4% of all convenience stores and gas stations in the state of Ohio.  The management of several tobacco dealers indicated that there is a sample of regular customers requesting TAAT ™ by name.  During the second month that TAAT ™ is available in retail stores in Ohio, the company will continue its legal-age smokers promotions, including a digital marketing campaign for the TryTAAT landing page ([http://trytaat.com](http://trytaat.com)) and an “Out -of-home media campaign ”on fuel dispenser displays launched earlier this week at 1,087 gas stations in Ohio.

This is what Tim Corkum said:

>Of all the tobacco category products I have worked with, TAAT ™ is an outlier in terms of demand at its early stage. While at Philip Morris International, the world's largest tobacco company, I introduced dozens of new tobacco brands across Canada and the Caribbean. While many of the new products were reordered from retailers after the first few weeks in the market, none of nearly 60% of the stores where they were originally offered were reordered. I believe our patient, methodical, and disciplined approach to bringing TAAT ™ to the $ 814 billion global tobacco industry contributed to this strong early-stage performance, and I am confident that we will see these results in both Ohio and in other markets where we can launch TAAT ™ in 2021 and beyond.

The question is, will everyone enjoy the TAAT ™ cigarette? The answer is a resounding no! Just as little as a Beyond Meat burger tastes good to everyone or a Tesla is for everyone. But what you can read from the high rate of reorders is a high level of acceptance from those who have tried TAAT ™. For me, this is the essential parameter that can actually make TAAT ™ a success ala Tesla and Beyond Meat - as unbelievable as it may sound.

**What Tesla is to the automotive market and what Beyond Meat is to the food market, TAAT ™ is to the cigarette market. If one can achieve only 0.5% market share of the US tobacco market, then this would amount to an annual turnover of 1 billion USD.**

I'm in at 4.0 and I'm long on this one. 1.1 billion smokers could be facing a major revolution and the one trillion US dollar (1,000 billion) tobacco industry facing total upheaval! The focus is actually on TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (NYSE: A2P6PR)!  The Taat Beyond Tobacco ™ cigarettes are a special class in this field, a tobacco-free cigarette that smells and tastes like a ""real cigarette"" and at the same time eliminates negative elements such as the addictive nicotine content, even though it is made from 100% natural ingredients!

In the end, I am not a financial advisor so don't take anything for granted and invest only what you can afford to lose in a worst case scenario. But for this one I am sure we could potentially see 10x if not even 100x gains at some point. This stock has a noble cause.  If you look at Steve Jobs and Elon Musk people stuck with them because they have a ""noble cause"" (there was a study that Apple users had the same brain scan when discussing Apple or discussing religion). TAAT's founder Joe seems to be a good face to lead this ""noble cause"" of saving people from nicotine. It should not be just about business and market domination but primarily about a movement, a worthy cause.",2021-02-01 21:22:35

A generation of people affected by 2008; many of whom had just taken their first steps into adulthood, or were just kids when they overheard the desperation in their parents’ voices as they discussed their bills, only to be drowned out by intimidating talk of recessions and bailouts from the news. The very institutions Americans had placed their faith in were backed into a corner by their own greed, and this generation took the fall. Many stood up to the injustice and were met with splashes of champagne, a humiliating mockery from the very same who had designed their fate. This generation was shaped in one way or another by the 2008 Financial Crisis, and now, this very same generation has seen that it was all for naught; that those who were responsible for 2008 have not learned; that greed has yet again led to a black swan event once only discussed in our own small corner of the internet; that the institutions will still do everything they can to avoid responsibility. But unlike 2008, the power is in the hands of the people, the hands of those who endured those hard years, the hands of this generation. And as I sit here, gazing out my window at a city of stars, I feel at peace. I know that this generation is the one that endured enough to say no more, and the one that not only has the strength and resolve to fight, but the one that has the will to sacrifice for the greater good.

GME Original Analysis and Thesis for why I bought in at $13.,190,l9wte6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9wte6/gme_original_analysis_and_thesis_for_why_i_bought/,50,1612189912.0,"Evernote link for better formatting
https://www.evernote.com/shard/s406/sh/c770a0f8-21e9-75b5-9fa1-8afe83712c8a/b5c179b3717cccf990bd14b187d71dce

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

It goes through immediately with no fees. For example, I sent it to my husband. Then it gets auto deposited into our bank for immediate use. No needing to wait days for them to transfer it to your bank. 

I can then use the funds to purchase stock WeBull or another platform. Obviously, you have to sell stock to access your capital so I wouldn’t use this method for the money invested in AMC and GME. Personally, I’m leaving those stocks in Robinhood for now but transferring any other capital that I can to a platform that doesn’t limit my purchasing power.

You can check how much cash you have accessible by clicking on transfers and scrolling down to “withdrawable cash.” This is not financial advice. I’m just an idiot who knows how to pull out.

**There’s also an account number and routing number on RH. Even if you don’t have a card, this may be a means to transfer.**

Those GME open letters made me cry harder than when I lost my Velcro shoes. But I ask you to once more strap on that propeller hat, crack a juice box and really  hear me out. You are my brothers and I don’t want you to get caught in the crossfire. 

What’s the big deal?
So it turns out that us glue eaters are an absolute force to be reckoned with when acting in unison. But this short squeeze is so powerful, we have the potential to inadvertently set off an insolvency bomb that will put a hell of a dent in the market. You might already be scratching your head but allow me to explain. 

Hedge funds are feeling the pain. If this squeeze happens like we hope, these guys will be margin called. This is happening at a time when we’ve already been looking at a record Call/put ratio for months. The reason that matters is because these institutions that have been selling you guys all these calls have to buy shares to decrease risk when they sell you those calls. They’re sitting on a huge stockpile of shares all across the board at a time when no one has cash. 

Why does no one want cash?
Cash is and has been the worst thing to hold since the housing bubble. To put it plainly, the fed lies to us about the true rate of inflation with something called the Consumer Price Index. They do that because if they told the truth, the government would be required to compensate for the increased inflation when they administer social security. It’s a story for another time but just understand that our assets (stocks,houses,whatever) are not necessarily increasing in value even though it looks like it. Your buying power is decreasing because of the quantitative easing that’s been happening since the housing crisis. So cash has been a guaranteed loser to hold for a long time. That’s especially true for our current situation with the absolutely ape shit printing. You might not see it in your milk price right away but you can bet your sweet ass that all those corporate bonds being bought are allowing these companies to buy back their own shares and artificially send their stock price flying. So nobody likes holding cash right now. Not you, not mutual funds, not sovereign powers. 

Why is this so bad and why should I care?
Well nobody is sitting on cash reserves, including the hedge funds you’re blowing up. When volatility increases, they HAVE to decrease risk and you Velcro assassins are sending volatility to the moon along with the rest of the retail crowd. They are going to have to liquidate a massive amount of shares from the stockpiles they’ve been accumulating just to avoid getting margin called. Or they need to get cash that no one really has available to lend them. If the mother of all short squeezes happens, we could see a wild scramble for dollars since we are in the midst of the biggest credit bubble imaginable. They’ll all need it because insolvency will be knocking on the door and no one wants to be the one with a shit ton of debt when it all goes south. 

What should I do?
Continue your crusade but please please have a hedge. Buy a few UUP calls. They’re dirt cheap and if shit hits the fan like last March, they’ll at least 5-10x. In my opinion it’s the best way I know to have an inexpensive long dollar ace in the hole. Or buy cheap puts. In fact, let me know if you have a great idea for cheap puts. I’m sorry if this isn’t the best explanation. Just wanted to get it out fast before market open. 

TLDR: You’re my glue eating brothers in arms and I’m trying to watch your back. Buy a few cheap UUP calls as a hedge and keep giving those hedge funds hell. 
Good luck my brothers.
Edit: holy shit you guys. I’m not telling you to stop buying GME. I’m telling you to get a cheap hedge.",2021-02-01 15:39:05

2. Weak profit margins.

Can they survive?: They can be *restructured* but the current state of the company looks questionable. I haven't dug into their 10-K's but I glanced over some of their filings and they stated somewhere in 2020 that if they couldn't raise more cash they were gonna go kaput by 2021.

What does their future look like?: What's the ""New Normal"" after COVID? We see streaming services up, Movie studios are fighting to go direct. I mean how much longer can theaters run a profit YoY with the current climate? Am I underestimating the vaccine? The luxury of a night out?

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Let’s say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn’t trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares.

I get it- you guys were here already. You have a culture and you enjoy being part of this community. Suddenly, every dingus from all four corners of the Internet is coming up in here, going ""what's a stonk?!"" and ""should I buy a 15c GME for next year?"" and ""my boomer dad told me to invest in ETFs should I do it?""

It's annoying. Your sub has been completely derailed by the GME mania, and for what it's worth, this moron appreciates those who have taken the time to share their knowledge. I have, no shit, learned more about finances and economics in the last week than I have in my entire life. 

This isn't /r/investing. People should not be coming here for advice. So thanks for putting up with the noobs, and even having the decency to remind people that GME is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that if they make enough for a extra large tendies meal with extra dipping sauce this time, they may just as easily lose it all on the next outrageous OTM call that they're scheming up.

You probably didn't ever imagine it would happen, but you have most likely shown thousands or even millions of young people all over the world how to access and understand the stock market, which is going to promote financial literacy on a level that we haven't seen before outside of the rich and elite.

I'm not just holding GME for maximum tendies and a trip 'round the moon, I'm doing it because I like the stock- and I learned all about this wonderful stock right here.

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with 💎 ✋.

2. Everyone who is wishing death to robinhood and move to fidelity and orher brokers. Do you remember pre-robinhood times and do you think brokers would have ever made trading free on their own? Hell, do you think this 'revolution' would have been possible without Robinhood in first place? What stops bigger broker go back to $5 per trade fee once Robinhood (and now webull) are dead?

GME Oddity and what it could mean,176,l9uwlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9uwlm/gme_oddity_and_what_it_could_mean/,111,1612183037.0,"So I've been waiting to see someone talk about this. The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.

If you are a big player with over 50,000 shares of SLV you are allowed to redeem your shares for real silver.    


They do it to partially hedge their naked short of silver in the futures market, so that if some of their contracts call their bluff they can pull silver from SLV to meet the obligations of the futures contract.    


Their stake in SLV is not even close to enough to cover the 250-1 naked short position they have in the futures market if enough longs start demanding delivery.    


Not everything is a conspiracy, and a pre-existing position in SLV that a fund has carried for 'futures market insurance' isn't related to the GME squeeze.

Seems like a lot of people want to chase the big money fast (OFC who wouldn’t want to do that) 

While this short-squeeze has been going on, and the sell off that just happened, a lot of good stocks has gone down, including Apple and Facebook after great earnings numbers. Even tho Tesla missed earnings expectations, Tesla is still a great investment. 

What’s interesting is that if anyone has watched Keith Gill (u/DeepFuckingValue ) YouTube videos (Roaring Kitty) he invested into GameStop because he states that he’s a value investor. (7/27/20 and 8/04/20)  
Keith Gill took the time and educated himself on GameStop’s position. 
Keith saw that GameStop was highly undervalued. He saw that they have more cash on the balance sheet and that the market cap was less than the amount of cash on the balance sheet. 
Keith researched about consumers spending habits on physical vs digital consoles and games. Also on physical games vs physical movies and physical music copies. 
Keith saw that GameStop has potential to make a lot of money on the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

GME: Next Steps,1083,l9ul1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ul1c/gme_next_steps/,299,1612181947.0,"I've gotten more than a few DMs so I just want to offer my thoughts in a larger setting. I apologize for wasting others time and space.

Background: MBA w/+20 years including stints in Investment Banking, Equity Research, VC and Corporate. ( = I know enough to be dangerous.)

**Should I invest tomorrow?**

I would invest with the understanding that you're playing a high risk/high reward game vs. the best on Wall Street (WS) who aren't accustomed to losing. (Hell, you put a 50% dent in one of the most high profile HFs on the Street.)  Reddit/WSB (WSB) is beating WS at its own game and WS will not accept that. The reason that I would still buy shares is because I'm perfectly comfortable waiting out the shorts, who I believe didn't cover entirely based on some sketchy trading volumes and price action on Thursday known as ladder attacks, which is basically artificially lowering a security's price by selling it back and forth between two parties. (Note: the WSJ is reporting that Melvin closed their positions at a loss of 50% to the fund. Maybe they did, though I don’t trust Melvin or the WSJ. Regardless, I have no doubt that other HFs are salivating at the short opportunity given where GME shares are currently trading.)

**The key is the somewhat unreliable short data which comes out next week.** As I mentioned in a previous post, getting accurate short data is next to impossible. It makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison. It has gotten to the point that I don't believe anything I read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data. No firm wants it positions known so there is a strong incentive to obscure/hide the data. Another reason why Melvin publicly releasing its positions is just highly unusual/odd.

I would also be aware that a lot of HFs are making bank off the GME volatility by selling options and taking long positions. Just look at [r/thetagang](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/). The group is making their entire investment decisions based solely on the option premium without any concern for the underlying narrative to the point where they're short GME puts at the 200 strike. (And they think WSB is full of retards!)

To use an analogy, I'm a lifelong Giants fan who put a $1,000 down on the Giants beating the Pats in the 2008 Superbowl. The Pats went undefeated all season and the Giants entered the playoffs as a wildcard. The bookie even told me when I placed the bet that I was just throwing away my money. I bet the money line, i.e., no points, and ending up winning $5,000. The bookie just smiled at me when I handed him my ticket. Sometimes you just gotta trust your gut and stay loyal to your instincts no matter what others think. It's what separates the men from the boys.

TLDR: It’s a cliché, but don’t invest in GME what you can’t afford to lose. At this point, you're going against some very powerful hedge funds, i.e., the Pats in 2008. That said, WSB already scored a very impressive victory and is retarded enough to not realize how good their competition really is (just like the Giants in the Super Bowl).

**How will the media portray the narrative?**

The media have already started spreading the narrative that WSB is going to cause a financial collapse rather than the true culprits, namely, the HFs which leveraged up 5x to short 120% of a company's shares outstanding setting the stage for an infinity squeeze, which is the financial equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction.  I mention this because the greatest risk IMHO is government intervention to quell the markets when the HFs start unloading positions to meet margin calls and borrowing costs. Nobody will lose sleep over a few billionaires losing a few commas in their net worth but hitting 401Ks, pension funds, and endowments is a different story. The official narrative will involve large commercial banks which loaned Melvin and other HFs billions to leveraged up with. These banks are regulated by the SEC and FDIC because they hold commercial deposits. When the narrative shifts from Melvin and HFs to names you recognize, e.g., JPM, BofA, Citi, rest assured the game is almost up. My guess is we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this game before it's stopped.

When people ask me about WSB I first discuss the HFs who created the conditions and then secondly note that thankfully we're dealing with a relatively small company in GME with a market cap of $20bn (so far!) compared to a company in the S&P 500, which is the basis for index funds and portfolio construction. In short, WSB did everyone a favor by calling attention to such a disastrous scenario in as optimal circumstances as possible. We should be very thankful WSB alerted the public to a systematic flaw in the financial system before a much greater meltdown occurred.

TLDR: The media are the PR firms for Wall Street. They exist to promote a narrative and receive access and compensation in return. They have no interest in reporting how the retail investor is being swindled. In contrast WSB did everyone a favor by pointing out a very serious systematic flaw in as optimal fashion as possible. This is the truth and the message that needs to be heard.

**What’s the next step?**

FINRA releases short data next Tuesday, February 9th for the period ending this past Friday, January 29th. Roughly 700mn GME shares changed hands last week or 10x the total shares outstanding so I'm pretty sure the short interest (SI) has fallen below 100%. However, I expect it to still be well above 50% given the typical HF’s risk appetite by which I mean they expect the retail investors to run for the exits sending shares back to $20-ish levels. I would love to know the borrowing costs for these firms because it basically tells you how long they can wait before such costs negatively impact their returns. My guess is until March when they have to report 1Q results to investors.

TLDR: Short data will show a decrease in SI, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it’s important to note that the risk/reward profile of the trade has moved.

**How much good did this GME trade really do besides transfer a lot of wealth?**

A heck of alot. At a minimum, WSB drew well needed scrutiny to the role of option clearings firms such as Citadel\* and Wolverine, i.e., the shadow economy, and their dual roles as market makers and hedge funds (players and referees). This screams conflict of interest. A revolution doesn’t happen overnight but this is another step forward in demonstrating how rigged the game is against the retail investor and guy in the (Main) street. Our regulatory agencies exist to enforce transparency and fairness. WSB has demonstrated that the derivatives market and particularly short selling lack both and have the capability to cause a financial panic. And of course, there is the unbelievable amount of charitable donations from WSB gains which prove who the real Robinhood is. (Sorry, couldn’t resist).

* Citadel alone handles more than 25% of US equity flow. The company is a monster and barely anyone knows it exists, which is how they like it. They tell Wall Street what the regulation is and they pay Washington to enforce it. Former Fed heads Bernanke and Yellen have received almost a million in combined comp for speeches and advisory services from Citadel. In short, Citadel makes Goldman look like the United Way. And oh, yeah, 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes from Citadel in return for order flow. Assume what you will.

TLDR: Sunlight is the best disinfectant – Justice Brandeis

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

For the questions below and messages:

As I tried to communicate in the write-up, I would characterize the trade as more risky than a week ago when the SI was above 100%. I have no doubt many shorts have since closed. That said, I suspect the SI is still well above 50% given where the stock is and typical HF risk appetite. This is not a trade for your parents or grandparents.\* There is serious risk here that the share price collapses based on who the counterparties are and the lower SI. That said, I still like it and I'm in it. IMHO, it comes down to a game of chicken in the sense of who is willing to hold longer. HFs have investors to report to in 1Q vs. WSB who have bills, rent, and life to deal with. As my old coach would say, who wants it more.

* The market has returned \~11% per year for the past decade. A good HF aims for 2x that. You guys are banking +1,000% returns on a trade lasting approximately a month against the best HFs on the Street. These returns are not normal or even within several standard deviations. They are clearly not for the faint-of-heart. We are in unchartered waters here. No shame in heading back. The fact you've come this far is simply amazing. Even you wife's boyfriend would be proud of you.

It is embarrassing and frustrating that they took money from Citadel and are protecting them by limiting your trades, even with trades for GM and SBUX !!!! 

The only thing that is good about Robinhood is that it enforced the brokerage game to revolutionize with zero fee commission and allowing the opportunity to buy portions of stocks. 

I’ve been with Schwab for years, and it has the same features Robinhood has now. Yea, sure the app isn’t as pleasing as Robinhood’s but Schwab offers their insight and research on stocks. I’ve heard that Robinhood charges for research, but correct me if I’m wrong. 

Also Robinhood did not disclose the fact they were selling order flow until they got caught and are being sued.

Before I had an aneurysm and went full baby 🦍 on her, I calmed myself. She has been fed by the MM bought media.

I asked her to explain and she tried to turn CrookNetworkBoughtConversation on to show me. After some discussion and challenging her facts, it was obvious she was simply uninformed and had no reason to mistrust the network.

We must get ahead of this narrative in the most accessible way possible. Real life conversation. The younger generations do not own the media networks (yet) and the age distribution in congress is overwhelmingly elder.

###If we do not get ahead of this narrative through word of mouth, we will be blamed for the next decade. 



**TL;DR Older 🦍 think this is younger 🦍 fault. Smashing 🍌🍌 and getting angry will only reinforce this view. Young 🦍 must share 🍌 with older apes and calmly reject the narrative. We must preemptively challenge the narrative with everyone we can to get ahead of the shit storm. $GME to Uranus 🪐🪐🪐**

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

Your broker will sell those shares for you swiftly and that is perfectly legal. This could cause GME to fall quite a bit since the gamma squeeze was the result of MMs having to buy those shares you now own and are being forced to sell.

#Why is every bearish speculative view on GME now considered Melvin propoganda? Check my fucking post history, dipshits. I'm allowed to have a bearish short term outlook for a stock that I'm long term bullish on especially when my initial cost basis is probably 1/10 what yours is.

1. Constantly moving price targets alone is a huge indicator that were topping a crest.  In the last 1 month I've seen the price target move from $240-$500 to a ""serious"" $10,000/shr..

2. This sub is FILLED with emotional trading which is the complete opposite of what WSB was founded on. It's all about the money and it's ALWAYS been all about the money. Cry me a river about unfairness... The market was ""rigged"" when the money printers were going brrrrr back in may and WSB was made up of 90% people WHO WERE SHORTING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY.

3. The amount of people with outdated news at this stage in the game will show you who the bagholders will be. They weren't quick enough to jump on the band wagon at $40/shr, what makes them think they'll be able to perfectly time a single (or half) day event?

4. Mr. Shrek (the one and only posterchild and ACTUAL WSB mod) is short term bearish on GME and doesn't even hold a position. And he's locked up and talking through a contact. That should tell you something about the current bagholders.

TL;DR don't be a shoe shine boy. There's a psychological reason that the ones who are slowest to jump aboard are the ones left holding the bag.

John Galt, if you're out there, I'm waiting for my invite.

The hedgefund guys are billionares. If there's one thing they know how to do, it's make money with legal/illegal/immoral practices. If you're not willing to stoop to that level, then you're at a disadvantage.

***I think*** we're in the greater fool stage. Maybe you'll be able to sell if the stock opens at $500 OR maybe you'll eat shit if it gaps down to $200. Either way, you need a plan, and that plan should not include the word ""hope"". What gain/loss are you willing to take; whats the mathematical probability that will happen; and what are you going to do about it whichever way it goes?.

It's fun to pretend that we're making money *and* dEsTrOyInG tHe 1%, but it isn't based in reality.

Yes, some hedge funds are short on GME. Melvin Capital, in particular, is massively fucked. Which is hilarious.

But, who is long? Let's take a look:

>The 10 largest shareholders/owners of GME are:

>- Fidelity Management & Research 13.67% (9,534,090 shares)
>- RC Ventures LLC (Ryan Cohen) 12.91% (9,001,000 shares)
>- BlackRock Institutional 11.32% (7,897,907 shares)
>- The Vanguard Group, Inc.	7.58% (5,288,116)
>- Susquehanna International Group, LLP 6.37% (4,444,128 shares)
>- Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. 5.66% (3,948,114 shares)	
>- Senvest Management, LLC 5.18% (3,610,740 shares)	
>- Foss (Donald A) 5.04% (3,515,200 shares)
>- State Street Global Advisors (US) 3.74% (2,609,487 shares)	
>- Sherman George E Jr 3.39% (2,361,670 shares)

That right there is 75% ownership. And if you looked at the next top 10 investors, it would be more wealthy investors and hedge funds.
 
Of course, not all of these are hedge funds and 1% investors. Some are mutual funds (i.e Fidelity and Vanguard), so some of these shares are ""owned"" by the working/middle class in various retirement accounts and similar. But, it's pretty obvious, as *all companies are majority owned by the 1% and hedge funds.* That's how it works. 

It's impossible to know exactly what % is owned by retail investors/redditors in brokerage accounts, but it's obvious that it's a tiny, tiny portion.

So, what happens we we boost GME? Well, Melvin Capital gets fucked (again, hilarious), and their wealth is essentially transferred to those who own GME shares. Which is... mostly other hedge funds and wealthy investors. So, we're not transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, we're transferring wealth from rich fucks to... other rich fucks.

And, sure, redditors are skimming a little off the top, and that's great, but it's not a notable amount, in the grand scheme of things. And, if GME crashes, it's gonna be redditors who hold the bags, and the hedge funds will win again (more than they already are).

So, what's my point? Is it to shit on a movement? Am I a CoRpArAtE sHiLl sent by a melvin bro to knock down the stock? No (I wish). 

My point is this: whenever some bad news or fake news comes out about GME (i.e. when it was falsely reported that Melvin exited), everyone was 100% sure it is manipulation by Melvin Capital (and the wall street bros). And, it probably was.

But, when some good news comes out (like how we're DESTROYING THE 1% or a billboard in times square), absolutely *no one* considers the possibility that the hedge funds and 1% investors that own gamestop are trying to trick you into buying GME shares. And that's dangerous.

This movement has caused millions of brand new investors to make robinhood accounts and buy GME shares, and *they don't know what they are doing.* They believe that pumping a stock owned by the 1% is somehow a moral battle against the rich, because everyone is telling them so. That's not only wrong, it's also dangerous.

So, go ahead and downvote me, idgaf. Facts are facts, and I advice new traders to not *only* consider downward manipulation, but to also consider upward manipulation. Because you better believe that there are more rich fucks long on GME than short, and they *love this movement.* And they desperately want you to buy shares.

The newly built $1 trillion dollar AMC Theatre is dope af*.* As you walk custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you head across the street to reminisce about the old life you left behind. You think to yourself *wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself *Sir, this is a Wendy’s.* That joke just never gets old. You immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity. *Ah I’ll throw him a bone* you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you out back for the Wendy’s Special.

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there’s a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says *It’s $42,069 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god… has he really not covered his short position yet? After some haggling you managed to get the price down to one silver bar. You take out your other phone, the Nokia G420 SLV Edition as payment but Andrew snatches it away from you. He throws your phone to the man in the dumpster and they both make a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man’s shirt which read “Melvin Capital”.

You shake your head as you take out your BB to tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin. *Impressive* you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitudes and longitudes provided by Palantir. *What a technological marvel* you think to yourself. This was the only DD that you needed. 

*Perfect timing*. Your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her ex-boyfriend’s girlfriend home. You submit your market order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD’s, you just really like those stonks. You get in your Tesla and head home. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Alright here’s a sports analogy for you apes that might like sports but are still struggling to understand what’s happening with $GME.,148,l9tl5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9tl5l/alright_heres_a_sports_analogy_for_you_apes_that/,45,1612178685.0,"This might get deleted. I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD’s, but I’m hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that’s happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If you’re still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I’m here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than 🦍 and 🍌.

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He’s legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let’s call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

He’s on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now let’s a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they’re old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, “Hey, I’ve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he’s got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he’s gonna be that bad”. 

4.) This dude let’s his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they’re that bad, especially with the new coach! There’s no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They’re making a playoff run. Now they’re gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they’re gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what’s going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People aren’t having it. They’ve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn’t legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he’ll succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They’ll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming “This player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn’t believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money”. 
It doesn’t matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It’s undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesn’t cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They’re getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that’s fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


That’s where we’re at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we’ve already known, what we’ve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it’s too late. WE’VE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we’ve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we’ve seen, what we know. They can’t. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We’ll succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.

I’ll get downvoted back to Lumbridge, but there’s no second thought to go to another brokerage.

#Here’s my reasons:

1. **The BEST UI out there.** It completely eliminated the learning curve for fundamental training. I started trading in November 2020, and have reaped 200% gains in 3 months. If I had picked a legacy, more complex boomer brokerage, I’d probably be in boomer ass SPY / VOO type index funds due to being mentally handicapped.
2. **This shit runs deeper than Robinhood.** remember when big guns shorted airplane/defense stocks right before 9/11? Who’s really in control here? These brokerages limiting trading certain stocks are the puppets being manipulated by some greater master.
3. **Early access to their IPO.** everyone leaving to Fidelity will force their hand to offer a shit ton more shares to users pre-IPO. Let’s be fucking honest here, this stock is going apeshit to mars. GME is just the current trend. There are new investors everyday and Robinhood will still remain the go-to with its referral incentives and ease-of-use.

This doesn't make sense. Shorts closing *should* mean more shares being bought thus driving the price up.

Note the date. **Wednesday.** This was also happening during the short ladder manipulation. It's more likely that a lot more shares were ""borrowed"" (shorted) from already shorted shares to create that short ladder manipulation, but they weren't disclosed.

Payrick Byrne, ex ceo of overstock, waged this battle about 15yrs ago. Got called a looney by wall street but fought through it and won some parting gifts. Interestingly, one guy he accused was Steve Cohen. At the time he ran SAC hedgefund (named after him Stephen A Cohen). Eventually got busted for insider trading and had to close shop with only about 10b. Bought the mets and now reopened shop with another hf, Point 42 or something like that. The guy that started Melvin was a SAC protégé and I think Steve floated them some money on that last bailout. Anyways, might be interesting to parse the past a little and head down the rabbit hole.

I want to put this out there prior to anything happening in hopes of possibly helping my fellow smooth brains in the event i am correct. If this happens WSB had nothing to do with it the pattern has been forming since before most of you started trading.

After mixed reviews and some interest in my dms, I thought I would put a time table to my theory and possibly earn some Nostradamus style prophetic infamy or go down in a blaze of glory.

I believe SPX/SPY has created the largest three peaks and a dome house chart pattern ever seen. Typically these patterns are seen over a period of months, but, I believe this has been forming for years. I am predicting a severe economic downturn with a depression.

[SPX current comparison](https://preview.redd.it/jexd28xazre61.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac7b64688498b98ec83c2f57aae10b620d29c7b0)

The above chart shows the current 5 year SPX chart compared to an example of a past three peaks and a dome house pattern. Based on this March was not a crash but a signal of what's to come. As you can see if i am correct this will be the only time in history this pattern has occurred over a timeframe this large. I am not screaming the sky is falling, but facts point to the very likely possibility. 6/10 of the largest market rallies were during the great depression and 2/10 were during the 08 crisis. this is no different.

Timing

The above is the current spy chart over a 5 year period. I am operating under the theory that in april we entered the deflationary spiral seen in depressions, through fed intervention, stimmys, and other market factors we have yet to see the full brunt. My prediction is that the market will rally a bit over the next 2-3 weeks, and then begin its descent with the large drop coming in 4-6 weeks. This can be affected by an infinite amount of factors which could accelerate or prolong the pattern. According to pattern, we will see new ATH or near it on SPX then we will go down.

Since the short squeeze maybe around the corner I am just posting as a reminder to all the fellow soldiers in this war against the shorts.

Now...Many of us are making money we haven't seen in our lives, and some of us haven't invested at all.

This euphoria may make people forget the that...***Uncle Sam wants his cut.💵🇺🇸***

I know this gets mentioned in the comments but we can forget when we see the share price rocket, so this needs to be reiterated over and over. Also, I don't want anyone to get fucked next April because they forgot about some boring shit like taxes and income brackets. ***The IRS DOES NOT fuck around. The IRS is basically Liam Neeson in Taken -- ""If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue  you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.”***  They will find you and take what is theirs.

Remember, your gains will cover your taxes so set aside money for it when you cash out.

**How much you need to set aside depends on the state you live in and how much you make/made. So, please find out how much you need to set aside BEFORE you starting using the tendies!**  
If you live in a no income tax state like Texas or Washington, then great you get to keep more money, but you still have to pay federal income tax.

***Please don't be a retard and invest it back in because you can lose it.*** *Put it in a savings account, let it sit as cash in your brokerage account, or withdraw it and stuff it under your mattress (the worst idea but to   each their own)*

If you want to invest, then invest your other profits minus the tax money.

***If you are a dependent, then please talk to your parents/guardians.*** (***Realistically this mostly pertains to college students because anyone under 18 years can't open a brokerage on their own. But if your parents/guardians don't  know and you are under 18, then please talk to them.)***

**Most important for moving up in income brackets (PLEASE FUCKING READ IT):Some people will be jumping income tax brackets, and will be out of the low-income thresholds.**   If this you think this will be you and you are currently getting low-income benefits like medi-cal, food stamps, etc. Please set aside money to pay for healthcare if you aren't getting any from your work.

Okay boring tax reminder set aside...***This next part is for the college students that are going to make bank, because I know there are a few.***

Some of you autists are college students and are getting FAFSA or some need-based financial aid. ***Make sure you aren't going to fuck yourself out of financial aid*** because some of you WILL be fucking yourself out of financial aid and I hope you have a plan for it by working or applying for scholarships.

Colleges will be the ones eating your tendies; if you lose financial aid and don't have a plan.

Why I say some is because FAFSA only looks at prior taxes so next year's FAFSA will ask for 2020 taxes but tendies are coming in 2021 so you have one year of financial aid before FAFSA asks for 2021 taxes which is going to fuck you hard.Technically if you are graduating in 2023 you will be fine, I think, because the 2022-2023 FAFSA application will open in Oct 2021 so it will ask for 2020 taxes.(There are other questions about how much money have invested, in checking/saving accounts, and what not, but FAFSA really cares about your adjusted gross income which will be high because we are leaving this fucking solar system 🚀🚀🚀)

2023-2024 FAFSA application will ask for 2021 taxes, so if you think you are going to be applying for financial aid for those years, then please have a plan ready.

**Again, please make sure you find out everything IMMEDIATELY AFTER cashing in for the tendies!!**

I am not a financial advisor, or CPA. \*insert whatever legal disclaimer here\*

I am posting this as a reminder so my fellow 💎🤲 so don't get fucked over.

Because of this it will be very easy for the MSM to convince niave Boomers and others ignorant of the markets and financial terminology that it was ""memes and shit posting"" by all of us ""unsophisticated investors"" who are to blame for the economic black swan event unfolding. Their ""Problem, reaction, solution"" is to make it seem like YOU are the cause of the economic and financial collapse by simply turning their own game on them. The reaction will be the demand for help coming from the normies and mid-wits who are niave and ignorant as to why shit hit the fan. The solution will be ""New regulations to make sure this will NEVER happen again!"" And thats where they think they will fuck you... Only this time they won't. You must not allow this to become what happened after 9/11 where the problem and solution led to them fucking us over with bullshit unconstitutional laws. 

We all know who the real criminals are.

We all know their game. 

Make no mistake, all the talking TV heads have their scripts ready and all the politicians and regulators have their ""new"" laws ready to be signed. They will make sure that only the ""sophisticated investors"" can invest while they add taxes and regs that will squeeze the little guy out of the markets. 

You think AOC supports what happened to Melvin because she's so adept at economics and financial matters? She has an agenda with her band of retards to slip in taxes that will fuck you. 

Politics aside, no one in DC is your friend and anyone showing you ""support"" is only waiting long enough to drive their knife into your backs with regulations and taxes. 

And last... If you are buying Silver, BUY PHYSICAL SILVER. DO NOT BUY ETF's, THAT IS HOW THEY WILL FUCK YOU. IF YOU BUY PHYSICAL, THAT IS HOW YOU WILL FUCK THEM. (I'm not a financial advisor, this not financial advise, blah blah blah, don't be a fucking retard, do your due diligence)

How will you get ahead of their pre-planed narrative and ""solution"" to ""the retail investor question""? Let the normies and mid-wits who just parrot whatever they are told know what is really going on by explaining what the Federal Reserve Bank is and what they've done as well as the games these Hedge funds played at bringing us to this unfolding shit storm.",2021-02-01 12:36:32

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
>  
>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
>  
>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
>  
>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
>  
>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
>  
>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
>  
>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  
>  
>*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  
>  
>*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  
>  
>*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  
>  
>*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  
>  
>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  
>  
>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world’s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon 🚀 🚀 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. 🚀 🚀

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver.

I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here.

Make a sexy and “gamified” stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.  

But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.

Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.

I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?

Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let’s face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won’t encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.

So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn’t care about retail traders.

The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions.

The boomers go wild, coughing and scratching their eczema in excitement.

This tells you everything:  The stock isn't heavily shorted, this wasn't a squeeze, they were just answering high demand by manipulating you into over-paying.

Don't hand the hedges and banks extra undeserved banana tokens.

WHAT DO YOU:

* Delete Robinhood & get a real broker
* Never place another market order
* If you just love the stock, buy it

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

In no way should this be taken as advice by anyone or acted on in any way. I am, however, a stock-trading gamer who is currently sipping Pinot while writing this up for your wife's boyfriend to read on the toilet later tonight, all because of the $GME gains.  


Haha gotcha. HOLD! Sorry, Musk, but once my shares head into space the only thing you are gonna be able to brag about is that you land spent rockets on sea platforms.  


GameStop is still a viable company. Make me CEO (or at the very least a VP of some sort) because my Pinot-drinking ass has some baller ass ideas.  


(1) GameStop needs to start an active campaign with gamers protesting our inability to physically own property that we purchased. When I bought *Legend of Zelda* in its sweet metallic cartridge, I was able to sensuously rub my fingertips along the gold cartridge, savoring the pattern of oily smudges my callused hands left. I was able to trade it or sell it to someone, not to mention smell it. There was value in the game beyond just playing it. I could even sell it to GameStop for a whole dollar if I so chose. 

GameStop needs to be louder about this.  


Pokémon card collecting is still going strong. Folks are chasing physical cards, but what they are not doing is jumping to use the online codes shoved into each pack. Those are meaningless compared to the cards themselves. There is still a lot of demand for physical property, and this can be observed by thousands of gamers who wait in line for physical disk releases, many of whom are paying extra for ‘deluxe’ versions of their game.  


(1a) GameStop can use this buzz to make agreements with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo (and others of course) to allow them to sell ‘ownable’ versions of digital games. Yes, digital is nice and convenient, but do I own my copy? Can I trade it or sell it for a different game? Allow us to do this with digital copies and GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PLAYERS. GameStop can step in and buy back and resell digital keys on their website.  


(2) GameStop needs to become involved in sponsorship of competitive gaming. HEAVILY! They should have a goal to become the go-to name in that rising sport. Why can’t they host competitions with buy-ins and payouts similar to professional poker tournaments? Why think of the GameStop brand as a simple brick-and-mortar retailer? Amazon sold books, for shit’s sake, now they are selling everything cheap East-Asian labor can produce while at the same time hosting web services. The sky's the limit.  


That's all I've got for now.

Who would counterfeit shares of these vital U.S. institutions to cause their financial collapse without regard for the U.S. citizens? It is not possible to carry out this massive fraud without the cooperation of large Wall Street firms and regulatory complicity, indifference or lack of competence. Some firms are blatantly selling shares that do not exist.  25 It is impossible to ward off the downward price pressure from counterfeit shares diluting a company‘s value. The entire nation‘s value is diminished when the counterfeiting of securities is rampant. Simply put, this is a defining moment in the history of the financial strength of the United States. Other than home ownership assets, the largest U.S. household assets are tied to the stock market through retirement accounts. If counterfeiting continues, investment and retirement accounts will be backed by nothing but counterfeit shares, which they may already be holding in substantial amounts. To conceal the fraud perpetrated on the retirement accounts is simple, manipulate the markets to crash. The money previously plundered from these accounts remain in the hands of the counterfeiters and the statements sent by the Wall Street firms to retirement investors will reflect a crashed market value of their assets, i.e., you lost your retirement savings. The counterfeiting of U.S. traded securities is nothing less than a fraud of epic proportions. As with other illegal stock market activity, offshore shell companies are a likely depository of the ill-gotten gains. While U.S. citizens would like to trust that government regulators are putting the citizens first and protecting investors, this may not be the case. The ownership and trading irregularities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discussed above, seem so obvious, that surely our government would have taken the steps necessary to protect investors in these very important financial institutions from fraud in the market. Unfortunately, the facts do not support that the government did enforce the securities laws against fraud and market manipulation. It is necessary for the United States to do everything within its power to recover the enormous amount of monies that have been plundered from this country and its citizens. Bring the few illegal dealers responsible for counterfeiting stock to justice in order to assure that this United States economic disaster will never repeat itself. There is simply too much at stake to do otherwise.""

Americans: taxes on tendies,178,l9r422,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9r422/americans_taxes_on_tendies/,142,1612170850.0,"Have been seeing a lot of posts on taxes without details on what/where you owe (and confused apes in the comments). Here are the basics (not a professional cpa; just someone offering some basic advice):

If you are trading in a tax-exempt account (IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc): congratulations, you don’t have to worry about taxes on your tendies (at least for now)

If you are trading in a standard brokerage account, keep reading:

1) if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days,* the profit is considered short term capital gains. However, all cap gains/losses are considered together (write off losses against gains). 

Example: you bought $10k GME Jan 1. Sold GME in April (diamond hands) for $1,000,000. That is $990k profit. Now if you decided you’ve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset, you owe taxes on the $990k. The tax rate will depend on other income you have. It is taxed as regular income tax. Look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation (ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single). Rule of thumb: set aside 40% (usually will be more than enough). 

Example 2: However let’s say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in July 2021. Sadly, your $990k is a total loss. Congrats. You have no net gains/losses. You owe no additional taxes. 

Example 3: you are even more regarded and gamble your original investment of $10k hoping to make it back. You lose that too. Now that counts as a net loss for the year of -$10k. Well that sucks. But at least you can deduct $3k of it from your regular income (and carry the other $7k over to be deducted in future years). Note, this does not mean you get $3k back. It means if your income is $50k, you now get to deduct $3k and pay income tax on $47k. 

2) now, if you bought GME Jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in February 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2,000, you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes.  That $2k will be taxed at the long-term cap gains rate for tax year 2022. For 2020 tax year, those tax brackets (single filers) are 0% if your total income is less than $40k, 15% for income between 40 and 440k, and 20% if over that). Note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned CA’s is 13-14% (please confirm for your state). If you have other losses, you can write those off against the gains same as before. 

Also tip: all of this is SUPER easy to do in TurboTax. TurboTax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically. It’s super easy to use even you apes can use it. If you have a simple tax situation (eg just your tendies and your regular 9-5), just go with TurboTax. They also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help. 




*365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this + 1 day for stocks (ie buy Jan 1, 2021.. sell before Jan 2, 2022, it is short term)

Stress Management In Planning,140,l9r410,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9r410/stress_management_in_planning/,40,1612170848.0,"🦍🦍 HOLD 🍌🍌

##NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations. This is particularly  true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution. **The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.**

&#x200B;

The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition. What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached. There is a ***reason*** why the plan was made prior, in the calm. Remember, we are dumb-ass 🦍🦍 figuratively and quite literally.

&#x200B;

**Everything you do should be done with calm intent.** That means, if you planned to hold no matter what, **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to ~~sell~~ buy, set your limits and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan? Go have a 🍌🍌 if tempted to peek.

&#x200B;

The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake 99.9999% of the time. In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea. The time for open-mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams. Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.

&#x200B;

Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results. If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made. This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.

&#x200B;

###TL;DR **Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.** No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time. Calm 🦍 > Panicked 🦍

Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here,66,l9qx8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qx8p/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/,259,1612170261.0,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.",2021-02-01 11:04:21
Unpopular $GME DD,120,l9qvf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qvf9/unpopular_gme_dd/,290,1612170109.0,"Before I start, let me just say that I am all about the $GME train and hope it is a 1-way trip to Uranus for all those holding with diamond hands. I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME’s articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn’t want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin’ Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won’t issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!
💎👋🚀🌖

Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a “20% Rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this.",2021-02-01 11:01:49

Why YOU should leave Robinhood (because I can't),154,l9qt90,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qt90/why_you_should_leave_robinhood_because_i_cant/,185,1612169953.0,"Lots of Robinhood talk, of course. Here's the dilemma a lucky/unlucky few are facing and why you should help.


I, like several others, turned a joke YOLO into a fortune. Like $5k to $200k in a few weeks. Cool. And now I'm stuck.


If I transfer my shares and options to, say, Fidelity, I lose a week where my shares are locked. Oh, I'll still be able to watch my stock go up and down in Robinhood, but I won't be able to sell anything. That's normal and not shady, it's exactly how any broker would handle it. And under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue.


But these are obviously not normal times. Anyone want to lock up their account for the next week and watch what happens, unable to do anything? No. If we hit the moon and everyone sells by Friday, I'll be lucky to get access to my shares the following Monday. Just in time for this thing to come back to earth.


I could sell everything I have in Robinhood, but that still takes me out for a few days, since the funds need to settle that day, plus 2 additional days. Then, I can send the $ to a different broker. Even if that last part is instant, we're still talking about over 2 days. Again, anyone want to bet on where we'll be in 2 days. If I sell at $300 and this thing makes it to $700 by Tuesday, I'm fucked if I try to buy back in on Wednesday.


And don't forget - if I sell my options and shares, I give them to the shorts, which hurts everyone.


So what to do? Well, I'm obviously stuck for now. But you CAN help. If you're in Robinhood and not in my situation, you can leave ASAP.


Robinhood is restricting buying GME again tomorrow, so you can't get it there anyway. If you want to buy, switch to Fidelity or Vanguard or someone and buy there. On top of that, if Robinhood is 100% innocent (**HUGE** leap of faith there), we overwhelmed them and they actually do need people to leave so people who remain can buy GME again (obviously I won't). If this is simply a clearing house issue and they needed funds to be able to settle due to the massive volatility, the only thing that helps them is if people stop buying GME on their app. And since the whole motto is BUY and HOLD, you really shouldn't be using Robinhood.


So again: if you can, please leave Robinhood because I can't.

I went all 📄👐 and set a trailing stop order, and ended selling my 10 shares at about $1 profit, happy that at least I didn't lose money.

The next day was the first it closed over $100. And it just kept going up. Eventually, I got back on board... Sold most of the rest of my portfolio and bought $1000 of GME for about 2.7 shares.

"No, listen to me: It doesn't matter if short interest is above or below 100% of float. There is still a bigass short squeeze.",1086,l9qj41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qj41/no_listen_to_me_it_doesnt_matter_if_short/,252,1612169063.0,"Some folks seem confused about the fact that greater than 100% of GME floated shares are short.  (example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).) 

I'm here to tell you: IT DOES NOT MATTER whether the short percentage is above or below 100%.  Even 20% of a stock being shorted is a bigass signal that locating enough shares to cover is going to be REALLY HARD.

So let's look at why 100% of shares shorted doesn't matter: Shorted shares work exactly the same as money multiplication in fractional-reserve banking.  Picture a stock with exactly 1 share in its float, and that share is owned by autist ""A"". Shorter B borrows the share via a broker, sells to a buyer C, and the buyer C leaves it with the broker. The broker loans it out again to another shorter D, who sells to another buyer E.

Now there are two people who have shorted (B, D) and the short interest is 200% of the float. Note also: three people think they own the stock, and the total shares they own is 300% of the total shares issued by the company.  

**IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MATTER THAT 100% of the shares are shorted because there are now 200% of the shares in the hands of longs.** 

When you count up the total shares held by longs, even 1 share is loaned out for a short results in more than 100% of the float are owned by longs.

So GME has 113% of the float shorted on Friday, which means 213% is in the hands of longs.  This is still a VERY tough scenario to cover.

Literally all we have to do for reaching the **Andromeda Galaxy** is to hold. They are scrambling for every share in the market that they can get to cover and hide their extremely illegal naked short-selling and even more illegal counterfeit share issuing. 

2) DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY FAKE NEWS

There are a lot of posts over the weekend saying silver will be the next big squeeze. We should regard every such post with caution and scepticism. They are trying desperately to divert our attention. So don't listen to these reports and tweets as they may represent a trap. Reminder that they can manipulate data as well (such as S3 short interest data and Ortex data)

3) BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING

Last week, they used disgraceful tactics but expect next week to be *astronomical* in terms of *attacks* and manipulation. The hedgefunds will try everything to force us into selling. Whether it's the distribution of fake news via their friends in the media (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ et al.) or short-ladder attacks. We should prepare for everything including trading halts. Know that we (with support of the whales 🚀) have leverage if we just simply hold onto our shares. 

4) YOU MIGHT WANNA REMOVE YOUR $1,000/$420.69 LIMITS 

**The short squeeze has not [squoze](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) yet at all**. When it does, it has the potential to be the beast of all squeezes, forget ***Andromeda***, this may get us to the ***bounds of the known universe***. **$10,000 is not a meme**. 

5) WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

•Btw if you wanna change brokers but have shares on Robinhood, I advise you to wait until this is over. It takes 2 weeks to transfer shares to another broker like Fidelity and could play into the hands of Citadel. 
You can circumvent this and sign up for Fidelity and others simultaneously to your existing RH account. Diversification is the key 🔐.

We all felt betrayed when Robinhood halted trading in $GME, $AMC, $BB, and $NOK this week. But they are being set up.

Did you notice that lots of other brokerages also had restrictions?

Robinhood got a ton of awful PR from this. Do you think they *wanted* to fuck themselves over?

No my frens, their hands were forced. So then, who made the call?

# The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)

https://preview.redd.it/ldh3z4hmlle61.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdae43b722d31696a24c17c6a0dbb7ed8dffa4a6

You probably never heard of them. You've never seen CEO Mike Bodson on CNBC. They like it that way.

But it was the DTCC that **raised Robinhood's collateral requirements by 10x** [this week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week), causing them to raise an emergency $1 billion and halt trading on many stocks.

Vlad would LOVE to tell you this on air, but he can't. He is completely under the thumb of the DTCC. It's a case of ""we have altered the deal, pray we don't alter it any further""

Listen, I don't trust Robinhood. They're a bunch of 🤡🤡🤡.  But at least they provide a valuable service, when it's working.

What service does the DTCC provide?

Zilch. Nada. They are **pure middlemen**, earning a toll while providing nothing of value and taking no risk.

The DTCC is a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse ""settles"" the trades made at the brokerage. When you're manically clicking buttons all day on your phone, each time you create a trade. That trade doesn't ""settle"", and the stock doesn't become ""really"" yours until two days later when the DTCC moves it to your account.

Now if that sounds like some horse and buggy shit, that's because it is. The T+2 settlement is a relic of a bygone era when some broker had to rustle up paper stock certificates out of a filing cabinet and have his fuckboi carry them across town.

Now at some point before all of us were born, horse and buggies gave way to the internal combustion engine, and stock exchanges went electronic. The clearinghouses are just a glorified database run by legions of fuckbois carrying papers to and fro. They're obsolete. But they have money, and therefore powerful friends in Wall St. and Washington.

So clearinghouses had their role protected by regulation. **T+2 settlement is the LAW**. And the DTCC remains a powerful chokepoint that can change the rules to manipulate the market.

You were ready for a fight between David (retards) and Goliath (hedge funds). But the real Goliath on the other side is far bigger than we thought, it's the entire might of the US regulatory state and its leeches.

If you have suggestions for how to stick it to the man, I'm all ears.

# tl;dr

We are getting fucked over by the big bois, and they would laugh all the way to the bank to see us take down Robinhood without even noticing their existence.

Firstly you announce today that the shorts are not actually covered contrary to what mainstream media is shoving down everyone’s throat. 

Then you announce that in the space of 6 hours the shorts have covered down to 30 mil on a Sunday with no data mentioned at all after a massive “unexpected delay” 


Stop trying to spead fear it won’t work. You are using the same tactics as the 🏳️‍🌈🍋

You reported yourself that on the 28th there was still 58 million in short interest. If thats correct 30 mil was covered on Friday when the overall volume for the day was 50million lol


Edit 1/ The other thing is due to the fact $gme is such a big deal right now why would you publish premature results that you admit yourself are just “suggesting” the short interest has halved. Wouldn’t you actually want to be confident and wait for all the data to be collected which you say won’t be finalised until tomorrow so the results may be more accurate.

Edit 2/ Thank you for awards but buy $gme instead!

I happen to also believe this to be true, based on every indicator it seems they want us to believe the **false narrative** that they pulled out.

Companies have until February 2nd 6pm EST to submit their reports on Short Interest and then from there it will be released publicly after **4pm EST** on **Feb. 9th.**

I think this means they have until **Feb.9th at 4pm** to get this stock as low as possible to exit their positions, because if come the 9th there’s still a high short interest rate on the public record, then I think they know retail traders will all double down.

I believe they’re trying to plant the seed in everyone’s mind that tomorrow (Monday) is the final day of this phenomenon. So they’ll happily contribute to making a squeeze happen (anyones guess how high) but then they’ll afterwards push the narrative that it’s over to try to plummet the stock.

I know some people probably plan on holding indefinitely, but for those that do intend to take a profit, even just a partial profit to cover their investments, consider the information above. In the scenario where the stock stays high until after the Short Interest report comes out, it could potentially cause the biggest squeeze yet.

I am not a financial advisor. Please correct me if anything I’ve said is incorrect and I’ll add it as an edit if you’ve provided sufficient evidence.

I own two GME stocks, because I like the stock and believe in the fundamentals.

Edit:

toutoucnc pointed out they could just **lie about the data.** I still think this upcoming date is important to know but don’t rely on the data that will come out as fact. Anything could be misinformation, and I’m a noob at investing so take everything I’ve stated with a large grain of salt.

That said I think the essence of my post is still valuable.

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

To the newcomer,773,l9pg4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9pg4u/to_the_newcomer/,171,1612165781.0,"Just a reminder, especially if you're new here, you're not in competition with anyone else on your market account, your financial net worth, or your life.  

It's easy to look at the million dollar yolo paydays on here and get jealous, bitter, or simply disheartened at it.  Perhaps even just look at it as if it was an easy day.  But remember most didn't start with a trust fund, they started with a small amount and rolled it into a bigger amount over time.

It's easy to watch someone play a musical instrument and think it looks easy until you try.  Trading is the same way.  It looks easy but it takes time and practice to figure out a system that works for *you*.

And many here have blown their accounts up, losing *everything*, on bad bets and have had to start over.  I've even seen people get genuinely suicidal over losing it all after risking way more than they should have and ending up on the wrong side of a bet.  The stock market is an unforgiving environment, and if money or money making becomes your life you can easily lose it trying to grasp more and more.  There's way more to life than money, but if you're going to play here you need to know what you're doing and the risks involved.

Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.  With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode (thus far) even more so.  Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much ***NOT***.

After these plays are over (and one day they will be), there will be others.  You'll have to do your own homework (like DFV did for *years* before anyone knew who he was) on potential stock picks and plays.  Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.  I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.  It was a decent value play with a very high upside.  But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.

The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.  Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.  This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.  Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.  Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.

WSB isn't your normal trading sub.  This is a place for high stakes bets.  All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.  If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.  r/finance r/investing and/or r/stocks might be better options if you're new.   Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and/or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free ([investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) is a fine one imo).  You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.   Don't be stupid.

TL;DR: S3 Partners announced some breaking news on $GME for today and didn't deliver. They delayed the report by over an hour and then handing out a 12 year olds school report which has been done during the lunch break.

&#x200B;

Earlier this day they were showing indications that media is giving wrong impressions on how shorted the stock is:

""Amid the chaos of [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click), even the experts are confused about what’s going down. That’s why we need impartial data!!

3pm ET they gave their announcement on an "" Exclusive [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) analysis coming at 5:00 PM EST "" ( [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355965388002095106](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355965388002095106) )  which was heavily delayed without further notice.

Then again some time later they have published there report which doesn't fit there quality standards and usual work. It gives a strong feeling that they were stopped in publishing their original work and quickly scrambled some stuff together.

&#x200B;

The post and report doesn't provide even close to any useful data or proof to anything.

Shkreli on GME - 1/31,225,l9p1xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9p1xu/shkreli_on_gme_131/,456,1612164584.0,"Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

Why retail investors should quit zero-commission platforms right now,74,l9p0tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9p0tr/why_retail_investors_should_quit_zerocommission/,50,1612164490.0,"# What is Robinhood's business model?

The company generates significant income from [payments for order flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp), a common although controversial practice in which a broker receives compensation and other benefits for directing orders to different parties for trade execution. Robinhood refers to this revenue as rebates from [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) and trading venues.﻿ While the payments are negligible for small retail trades, a company that directs billions of dollars in trades to market makers can earn substantial amounts. This means that you are not a customer for Robinhood, **you are the product**. Your trading data, even considering it is full of autistic buys and sells, is valuable to the big players in the financial world.

# The conflict of interests

So considering more than half of Robinhood's revenue comes from these big financial companies, all directly connected to big hedge funds, there's a direct conflict of interest between Robinhood's clients going bankrupt and the users of their platform getting rich. The GME short squeeze made by retards like you definitely made Robinhood suffer pressure from its clients and they decided to pick the big cucks side.

# Will retail traders keep trading on zero commission platforms? 

You can't ignore the fact that people are actually retarded, so they will continue to use Robinhood even tho there's always be a chance that all of this happening again. The price of GME only stopped at $400 because most retail investors were trading on Robinhood, **no company should have such a high impact on retail investors** if we are really seeking to bet against cucks from Wallstreet.

This may have gone under the radar with all the hubbub surrounding GME but the significance of this contract cannot be overstated. 


The details of the contract are a little muddled at this time but it appears to be a seasonal contract, as in they Palantir software is only available to Girl Scouts of America during the summer months so they don’t have to be paying during the wintertime when they can’t fundraise anyway.


Downside: the price of cookies will probably go up astronomically.

The SLVer dudes want you to take down JP Morgan and help make Citadel money with your money. *Fuck that.* You do you, but that ain't the move for this retard. ~~Citadel can suck my musty nuts~~ ffs: it's like you have to put **AFTER THE SQUEEZE** in any non GME post. 🤦


**Now what IS the move in 2021, is cannabis stocks.** You can see my post history for a more in depth post, but here's what you need to know [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is already planning to combine multiple marijuana bills](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/cannabis/cannabis-stocks-watchlist-schumer-sundial-growers-tilray-canopy-growth) and has said marijuana will be a priority of the 117th Congress. 

[Vice President Kushala Harris was the Senate sponsor of the MORE act, which among other things would provide banking reform](https://www.google.com/amp/s/norml.org/blog/2020/08/12/senator-kamala-harris-senate-sponsor-of-the-more-act-chosen-to-be-vp-candidate/amp/) 

So what does all this mean? This means $CGC, $APHA, $CRON, $TLRY and most other cannabis stocks are fueling up for a 🚀🚀🚀🚀 over the next year or two as changes are announced and passed. [Including the entire country of Mexico legalizing marijuana this April](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/mexico-is-moving-to-legalize-cannabis-in-2021-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us). 

So AFTER THE SQUEEZE HAS SQUOZE, do you wanna make Citadel more money OR do you wanna put your dollars into the change you hope to see over the next couple of years? I know the decision is easy for myself, and it's up to each one of you to make your own decisions. This isn't advice, and the only advice I do have for you is: Blue crayons taste the best.

Why DID Robinhood halt trading on Thursday? A hypothesis from a fellow autist...,40,l9oy0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9oy0u/why_did_robinhood_halt_trading_on_thursday_a/,28,1612164255.0,"Consider the following timeline….

Once upon a time, hedge funds and brokerages decided GME was a dog and is the easiest money they’ve ever made and place positions (puts) betting that the price will go down. They placed bets to the tune of 140% of nominal value of all shares outstanding.

Some autists on Reddit identify this massive naked short bet and don’t feel their beloved GME (who they have DEEP SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS for) is quite the dog its being made out to be and so, just for fun, start buying the stock and placing call options, betting that the price will go up. They talk about it on WSB because that's what we do on WSB. Taking contrary positions is what autists do best. They almost WILL their beloved Gamestop to rise. It does.
Disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say WTF? This cant be happening That’s what celebrities said during the Great Fappening too. It still happened.

The ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making REAL money. Wuuuut, you can transfer money to Robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options? How hard can this be? People who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing. Word spreads. More join the fray. More huge wins. Loooks fun! More and more and more jump in.

Meanwhile in hedgietown, things are looking really fucking dire. WTF are these autists doing??? This CAN’T be happening… heeelp I’m melting. They watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than… Robinhood. Not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible. On the ""wrong side"" of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on Wall Street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets. Doh. We done fucked up this time. Wuuuuuut?
   
The ground swell on Reddit turns into a tsunami. It starts to make the news…

A strategy coalesces among the autists. Hey! If we hold and don’t sell wont the price rise? It appears to work.

Hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and haven’t bathed or shaved in three days. They are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water. Increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers, bankers and brokerage principals.

On Wednesday January 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the CEO of a private firm called Robinhood Holdings.

An offer is made.

 Hedgies: Hey V****. Great little company you got there. It would be a shame if it no longer existed say... next Monday, because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded US financial markets. Wouldn’t you agree? 

RH: (Silence on the line…) 

Hedgies: Here’s a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening. We need you to halt buying on GME on your platform for a “few hours”. Can you do that favor for us? If you do, we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive. This will have long term benefits for everyone including you and Robinhood, we assure you.

RH:So you are saying this is a systemic risk event?

Hedgies: Yes, that's what we are saying. 

RH: But what will we tell our account holders? 

Hedgies: It’s only for a few hours. Just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something. In exchange for this favor, we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company. So it’s a win-win. Would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay? 

RH: (A long moment….) Yes, okay.

Hedgies: Done. It’s transferred.

**Upon reaching the agreement for the “favor,” hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on GME for the next day (betting the stock will go down on Thursday). They also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a pre-determined time on Friday, betting the price will go up. They know after the halt, a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will trigger their call options.**

RH halts buying in GME for “a few hours”. The hedgies new shorts placed on Wednesday (for Thursday) are exercised to the tune of billions. When “limited” buying resumes on Friday, per plan, the price for GME shares rockets higher, triggering the hedgies call strikes. 

Hypothetically speaking, how much could one make if one were a hedgie ~~manipulating~~ saving the market like this? Billions and billions. How much did hedgies need to unwind their positions last Friday, 24 hours before this occurred?? Billions and billions. Hypothetically, that's an amazing coincidence....

Given this hypothetical, would it be enough to unwind more than their Friday positions? How much more? None? Some?

Dunno, WSB I’m just another retard like you. As proof of that I sold GME on Tuesday at 80 and bough BB.

We need to spend more effort on crowdsourcing information on the things that we want to buy. Not just stocks on the market but more importantly consumer products.

We are also the workers. We know what everyone buys. If you work in retail, start paying attention to trends of what people buy and tell us on the subreddit. If you work in manufacturing, are there a lot of orders or fewer than normal? We'd like to know.

Corporations spend billions of dollars each year for  consumer research to inform them on what to produce. We already possess that information. On an internet forum with millions of people we have the ability to have a competitive independent research apparatus that is free. That is such a huge advantage we have.

It must be difficult for some hedge fund investor who is in their office all day to really understand what people want and are willing to buy in ""the outside world."" They aren't buying cheap consumer products bc they don't have to. They can't buy the knowledge we have.

As investors, we need to think about investing as opposed to trading for short term gains. We can influence a company that produces a specific product that we think people want, build it up, and that company (with its newfound capital that we gave it) will make that product that people will buy.

Billboards and plans flying is great and all, but we need to leverage all these social media platforms as much as possible. If you like the stock GME or AMC or BB, then consider flooding Twitter with hashtags. 

A bs stock I can not mention (so the this can get posted) was just #2 trending on Twitter and they are taking all the hype. As much as only posting and commenting on this sub is great, we need the people who aren’t on Reddit to see that we are not the scumbags that CNBC is making us out to be. 

Take the donation stories, the DD, and Diamond hand emojis and rocket ships over to Twitter and let’s get #GMETOTHEMOON #AMCTOTHEMOON etc trending in front of these bs stocks trying to steer people away from the real prize!

Tweet that video of Jim Cramer exposing market manipulation, and let’s expose the hedge funds. We don’t need CNBC telling everyone how people here are actually using there gains for good we can tell them ourselves! 

The media is being paid by billionaires to make us out to be the bad guys. If 1/5th of the people on this sub each tweeted the same hashtag, we would be number a trending on Twitter and we would be heard!!

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

Why It's Smart to Hold - Capitalism 101 and Media Manipulation 101,405,l9oo9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9oo9m/why_its_smart_to_hold_capitalism_101_and_media/,67,1612163464.0,"\*This is not financial advice. I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. 

**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   
**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** 

**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  
\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  
\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    
\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  
\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders ""already won,"" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk ""immense pain"".   
\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   
\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   
\-CNBC also bought ""paid promotions"" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. 

Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in ""the stocks we like"". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**

**1) Don't Think of Elephants**

Quoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. 

Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the ""do-not-buy a lot"" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.

Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be ""on top of"" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the ""less bad"" decision and picked the worse one. 

**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**

So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that ""retail investors will be in for some real pain"". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. 

**3) Opportunities**

a. **Black Friday of the Century**  
Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. 

b. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  
If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those ""do not buy a lot of"" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.

TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from ""done"".",2021-02-01 09:11:04

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (“**Blackberry**”) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry’s product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

We are currently a part of one of the most historical times in the history of the stock market. Now, it is incredibly evident how they will try to make us seem. We are a bunch of fucking degenerates. I mean, a lot of you get off on losing tens of thousands of dollars only to YOLO another weekly on a Thursday night. I get why the media would resent us, the corporations/hedge funds suckle from their teet so they take easy shots. Even though these hedge funds ARE CLEARLY in the wrong. 

We have shown there is strength in numbers and with 7.5M of us, what if we take a small portion of our profits and we create a thread to show, how we took our tendies from this (**WHEN IT IS OVER OFC**) to make the world a little bit better. You could use this post to make it or another, it does not matter. 

**Think about how the narrative could be. A group of Redditors beat the hedge funds and then immediately proceed to give their money back to charities/communities/etc doing more for the world than most hedge funds have ever done. Now picture this, with 7.5M+ of us, if we all donate $125 (an amount I think is doable if you are not paper-handed) that would conveniently be more than a billion dollars given to charities.** Yeah, a billion. While the media and hedge funds are bitching about how these hedge funds lost billions of dollars, here we are: ""a bunch of so-called degenerates putting billions of dollars into charities."" Now it is one thing to tell your kids one day, ""yeah I made a killing during the short squeeze of the millennia,"" but I was a part of something which gave a BILLION dollars to charity. The media would not be able to handle it. We have them on the ropes. Let's bite their fucking ear off while we are at it!

Treat it as an entertainment post and not as a factual post. It's all alleged. I'm not a financial advisor and don't take anything in the post as financial advice.)

(Repost due to mistakes)

By  now as most of us know, Melvin cap has lost 53% on its investments and  that's only what we know(What's hidden to the public is way worse). You  might wonder, why the fuck didn't they exit their position yet? before I  answer the question, I want you to put into perspective the following.  Let's say that $GME was shorted around an average price of 40$(which is a  best case scenario for them) with 140%(if we combine all the players)  and on Friday $GME closed with the price of 325$! Which is an increment  of +700%(of the ideal short position of 40$). It means that as of Friday  they have lost their initial short position 7 times over! Them and  every other big player. So what? They most probably went to a margin  call and that's why they got the bailout money from Citadel. But why  won't they cover you might ask? Why prolong the pain and hold longer??

Well,  Imagine that you had the **Infinity Gauntlet of Wall street** with Billions  of Dollars, political power, and all the media in your palms, but with  all of that you got fucked over 7 times by a collective group of apes  who banded together with accounts averaging around 2000$! Keeping that  in mind, do you think that they will ever fold? Due to them knowing that  we are retards, they think that the $GME play is a house of cards and  with the right play the house will eventually collapse to presqueeze  levels. They will never accept a -700%+ loss and will try every play in  their Ivy league book on us. They used every possible trick in the book  from using the corrupt media, to ddosing Reddit and stocktwits, until  they finally were so desperate and used their Ace of Spades(Robin  Hood)(which took years in the making) in order to exit this shit hole.  Initially, it worked but when it started to fail, they went to full  market manipulation mode(stock restrictions). Freezing Buying didn't  fully work on $GME so they went and fucked every other stock they could.  They won on the side tables by fucking $AMD, $NOK, $BB, $AAL, etc...  and that reloaded their ammunition which is scary for me.

Now  moving forward, I don't think they will ever cover because they will  never accept a loss from an uneducated blue collar class in their eyes.  IMO, they think that they will be able to bend us over after all, but  they still don't understand that we don't have anything to lose. More  over, a lot of the people started with nothing and are willing to go  back to nothing if it means that they got a chance to fight and  potentially defeat the big guy on the battlefield. My biggest fear in  all of this is that even if we win, they will make a liquidity crisis as  their penultimate play. Then the government will have to interfere and  again bailout the big guy, because of course, when the small guy wins  for once, there is a liquidity crisis and his win isn't a win anymore  because small guys never win... But the real win, imo, is the small guy  while being poor, underprivileged, uneducated, and using primitive  weapons(metaphorically), being able to defeat a superpower(hedge funds)  in the battlefield(stock market).",2021-02-01 08:48:07
GME - Blackrock / ETFs,69,l9o5vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9o5vc/gme_blackrock_etfs/,76,1612161970.0,"Fellow Degenerates,

I keep it short.....ehhhm I meant long. I tried to add some spice so your brain can digest. Just keep going line by line! You can do it!

I am first of all scared to death that this is going to be removed in a second by autobots - yeah these scary guys from Transformers which you don't wanna fuck with (rather your friends wife to become officially her boyfriend - would be interesting to be for once on the other side of the trade).  Oh and if ever this post remains - this is no financial advice - I have literally no clue what i am talking about and I lost more money than I am ever able to retain - even if GME goes to the🚀and I keep my 🙌💎

Still I want to give it a try as I think there is two things one could include into the discussion which might add perspective.

First of all I was thinking about the role of Blackrock in this for quite a bit. I think a number of posts mentioned that they are a large shareholder of GME and that they increased their position. For what reason though? I came accross this paper [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf) \- just check the first paragraph. In short: Blackrock lends its shares to the short sellers ..... I leave it to you whether this could be relevent or irrelevant. I thought it is certainly something to take into account but as I said I am just someone who has no fkn clue about anything. Maybe there is going to be a discussion around it (hence the flair) or not.

Second I was thinking about possibilities how one could aquire Gamestop shares in different ways. Just out of pure boredem (ofc) and realized that r/investing mindset for once could be the solution (who would have thought this is ever going to happen!). So I went here: [https://www.etf.com/stock/GME](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) and was quite surprised to see that some of these ETFs have a significant share of GME in them. I have no clue how they come up with their particular distribution as I have no clue about how ETFs in general work but maybe it allows to acquire indirectly one or two shares. Not sure who would be stupid enough to do so - I am certainly not because I am never ever going to lay in bed with the guys from r/investing but at least I filled this extra boring long time between Friday close and Monday bell.

I am not expecting this to be really something prominently discussed (as I am sure this has been raised a million times before and I was just to lazy to use Search) and hence rather to be removed in a second but it was me a pleasure to give it a try and maybe I am lucky for once.

"You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME 🚀",225,l9o3vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9o3vs/you_are_being_played_citadel_and_point72major/,287,1612161814.0,"The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.

&#x200B;

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

&#x200B;

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. 

# BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

# AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. 

# NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

&#x200B;

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

&#x200B;

# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

i know that we are living through a moment of shared euphoria and it is easy to get caught up in it. by all rights i should be asleep by now. but i want to point out how fast this is happening, and how incredibly complex the relations associated with it are. the white house is watching wsb, it's getting front page news coverage worldwide. u/deepfuckingvalue is worth fifty million fucking dollars and is still holding. i have acquaintances and friends i have never spoken to about investing or stocks before messaging me to ask me about gme or amc or bb.

the point i am trying to make is that although we have seen stocks [rocket emoji] before, and although wsb has sometimes gotten fleeting references in say the financial times or the wall street journal, the last seventy-two hours has completely ushered in a new era for wsb. we as a collective entity have broached the mainstream consciousness.

we all know this. my post pertains to how we can use it to our advantage.

my fear is that the casuals are going to lose their nerve and start selling. it is imperative that wsb sends out a message to buy and hold gme, amc and bb (and nok if you're into it, it's 2021, nobody minds what you're attracted to anymore buddy). panic selling because of increased pressure on wsb is not an option. allowing mainstream media to act as propaganda mouthpieces for hedge funds and investment managers cannot be stopped, but it can be proactively countered.

we are seeing historical levels of market participation by people who have never before been a part of the market. if we can convince them to keep constant and hold, prices could skyrocket higher and faster than we have ever seen in recorded history.

don't fuck this up. i don't know if we'll ever have another shot this good ever again.",2021-02-01 08:27:28

DD: Macro Economic Outlook For This Week And Beyond,132,l9nje2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9nje2/dd_macro_economic_outlook_for_this_week_and_beyond/,107,1612160200.0,"Hello fellow Autists! I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

&#x200B;

First I would say there is some naked shorting going on, because there are some technical rules that allow naked shorting, but most of the time it is illegal. Now let me explain how a short can reach above 100%, via legal means.

Adam knows the price of videos tends to go down overtime, and his strategy has been too short videos. He would go to Blockbuster and rent The Big Short, and then sell it too Family Video. Bobby also has the same idea as Adam, so he goes to Family Video, rents The Big Short, and then sells it to Blockbuster. This causes the books to see more rental videos are in circulation, even when it is the same video moving among all these different hands.",2021-02-01 08:14:37

GME Game Theory - is true value of $GME now trapped at whatever the price of the stock is/was when short interest dips to 100%?,106,l9n5j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9n5j0/gme_game_theory_is_true_value_of_gme_now_trapped/,151,1612159144.0,"Hypothesis: There cannot be a stampede back down to $40. The squeeze has also not yet squoze. GME is trapped at whatever price it is/was when short interest is/was 100%. We've already locked in a profit, and now the trade is a waiting game. 

Rationale:

Everyone's already figured out what happens when short interest is 100%, and there is only one shareholder. The answer is the shareholder names his own price for the stock, ideally about 90% of the net worth of the short seller.

Unfortunately we are not one. There are paper hands among us. There are 67 million shares and an open market. 95% of the shares are owned by smart institutional $GME longs who also spotted the trade and diamond handed all the way with us.

Let me explain why this might not matter at all. I could be completely way off here, but it would appear that the >130% short interest for so long completely broke the valuation of GME, permanently. The reason has to do with game theory.

When short interest is 100%, shorts all need to cover their shorts in order to close their position and make a profit. 

Covering a short is buying a share. Buying pressure drives the stock up. If the stock is up and the short interest is down, you get new incentive to short. New shorts come in, and the stock goes back down. 

Say some paper hand longs start to sell. Selling pressure drops the price. The price is now down, but the short interest is still 100%, that introduces buying pressure. Buyers come in, and the stock goes back up. If short covering happens instead, the stock still goes up, but now short interest is down. Stock at same price with short interest down incentivizes new shorts. Stock goes back down, but now short interest is up again, which incentivizes longs to come in and buy shares.

You see where I'm going with this? I know that sounded complicated, but it's okay. We're all retarded here. 

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN:

This happened because short interest remained over 100% for almost the entire run up to $400, miraculously. At 8:50am on Thursday, clearing houses blocked the ability to buy GME when it hit $468. 

I believe it was at this selloff that the shorts were allowed to cover to below 100%.The stock's legitimate value is now completely unrelated to fundamentals, and legitimately actually valued somewhere in the neighborhood of $300-$400 a share because of this game... and the squeeze still hasnt squoze. 

I'm either incredibly dumb, or there won't be any bag holders buying $GME at $300. 

Positions or ban you say?

Trading Tips for stocks and options. Part I,36,l9n1o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9n1o6/trading_tips_for_stocks_and_options_part_i/,15,1612158834.0," I  though of sharing some trading tips and answers to questions I’ve seen  multiple times on Discord over the last two weeks. If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you’ve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) It’s expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above – if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published —  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you can’t. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change – the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That’s basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it’s the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash — they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I’m within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn’t exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that’s how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can’t sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if I’m not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don’t use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‘special sauces’ - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!",2021-02-01 07:53:54

Then they’ll profit billions from their shorts and buy back long positions at a discount later. Also, they’ll hope $GME and their other short positions will go down in the process to recoup even more of their losses.

The Beef:
Suits are fucked on $GME. They came at us with everything and failed. And now, every move of theirs on $GME is currently being scrutinized by the public and SEC. So they need to explore other options.

They have no other choice but to liquidate their long positions to cover their short positions.... and they’re going to use this to their advantage. THEIR NEXT BIG PLAY: They’re going short the market to make back their billions. I believe the suits are going to purposely tank the market through a massive, coordinated sell-off. They’re going to sell all of their long positions to cover their shorts at a future date, and then they’re going to promote fear on wall street and to the rest of the world. You’re going to see increased media campaigns about “market volatility, uncertainty, sell off” on all the major news stations and newswires, promoted by the funds. They’re going to push an entire bearish narrative and create worldwide negative sentiment. They’re also going to have massive shorts on the market while they do this to put them in a position to make back billions. Once the market is down, they’ll then buy back securities, change their narrative to bullish, and drive the markets up, riding their positions to the top. They control the “market media” as we’ve already seen. We’ve also seen how they’ve been able to control the narrative on $GME. And with all of this going on, they’re going to also hope $GME goes down with the market, as well as their other positions, so they can profit even more.

This sell-off will be a perpetuating cycle, a self fulfilling prophecy. When the big funds sell, other fund wills have no other choice but to sell too in order to save their profits. The narrative will spread and spread. I know this sounds convoluted and complex, but we’ve seen what these funds are capable of. And I can’t think of any other scenario where these hedge funds come out positive for the year. I hope I’m wrong. And if I’m right, I hope the public realizes what they’re doing.

So whatever happens, HOLD $GME!!!!! 💎🙌🏻

How to fix the short market,37,l9mux1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mux1/how_to_fix_the_short_market/,45,1612158309.0,"I've been thinking a bit about how to fix the current short market problems. Here are my ideas beyond just ""more transparency:""     
1. When a share is shorted, the original holder is explicitly given a synthetic share (GME-SX, or something). This solves one aspect of transparency.    
2. The owners of synthetic shares are entitled to at least half of the charged interest. I do think the brokerages should retain their lending fees, since it takes overhead to support a short market.    
3. A synthetic share cannot be traded. This is the inherent risk in owning a synthetic stock vs actual, you can't move it. You CAN recall your stock at any time, but like in the case of GME, it might take a while before you have a real share to sell.    
4. A synthetic share is not itself shortable. This should solve the overshort issue.    
    
Why bother doing this? Basically, I think that when an impossible position exists, like with GME, ***someone*** is going to get shafted, and I'd bet it's the ones with the least amount of leverage. I think these simple changes will still allow shorting, give retail investors another passive income generator, and still leave the possibility for short squeezes, just not infinite ones.",2021-02-01 07:45:09

I asked my buddy why he went long on GME and AMC, and his answer literally blew my mind:  ""I liked the stock."" 

To me, that is a fantastic and valid reason to buy stock. I'd be really suspicious if he didn't like the stock.

BLNK charging DD + short interest DD,30,l9mry6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mry6/blnk_charging_dd_short_interest_dd/,68,1612158089.0,"**There are many new people here, I do not want this to be a distraction. If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

&#x200B;

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon.",2021-02-01 07:41:29

Which would you rather regret?,282,l9mmvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mmvb/which_would_you_rather_regret/,144,1612157704.0,"IMO there is no way to watch what is happening with GME and others and not come out without some level of regret and hindsight remorse. The decision over whether or not to buy into this hype, or how much to buy, comes down to one question that you have to answer for yourself: **would you rather regret losing some amount of money if the stock ends up going down, or would you rather regret staying on the sidelines and watching all these other retarded monkeys fill their cages with so many bananas they don't even know what to do with them all?** 

I think this is an interesting way to frame it and I had a moment of clarity last night that I would way rather lose a few thousand if this goes to zero than watch this go to 5k and not be part of it. As others have said, you are paying to be part of history, this is a donation to the cause, this is insurance against wishing you had some skin in the game.

Some of you know I’m a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it’s finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare 

Steve Cohen’s tried to kill Watsa’s Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen’s group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years 

It’s obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It’s because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they’ve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don’t believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen’s group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don’t give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don’t care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I’ll get hated for this but it’s true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don’t YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You’re investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber. Fuck it, I hope Cohen gets destroyed and jailed, TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!!!! 🚀 🌙",2021-02-01 07:34:57

With the movement that GME has created, I was wondering what shorters will feel as the price continues to rise and pressures the squeeze.   

After seeing GME, shorters in stocks like AMC should be feeling FOLO (fear of losing obscenely) recognizing that that they can be losing more than 100% in a day and seeing borrowing rates rising.   I’m optimistic that the shares of other BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) will realize increases similar to GME as FOLO sets in causing shorts to race to the exits.

relevant parts 

> SPACs have a complex setup, but Andrew Park, a senior policy analyst with Americans for Financial Reform, argues that there are core problems with the model. “The first problem is incentives when you issue these SPACs,” said Park. “The SPAC sponsor gets 20 percent. No matter what, they get it for free,” which helps to explain the draw of celebrities, including Shaquille O’Neal, and government insiders to the space. That means that “everyone is incentivized to do as many deals as possible.”
> 
> Because of the incentive misalignment, “there’s now a worry about how good SPAC sponsors are at due diligence. They automatically get 20 percent for raising the money, ” Park said. “They’re going to chase after these private companies and good chance they’re going to overpay for them because they are acquiring a lofty valuation.”
> 
> 
>  Finally, “the end investors are not sophisticated,” with many small retail investors drawn to the SPAC space because of the hype around them — in part due to the SPACs’s ability to make claims about future performance that companies going through a traditional IPO are not able to do.
> 
> New York University law professor Michael Ohlrogge told the Intercept that hedge funds will buy the SPAC shares at a deep and undisclosed discount prior to going public, which means that they make money regardless of whether the business plan is sound.",2021-02-01 07:28:57

Citadel definitely manipulated the GME short squeeze on Wednesday to allow their buddies in Melvin to exit their trade. That doesn’t mean that everything any fund does from here on out is somehow related to GME. Don’t let paranoia get in the way of clear headed thinking.,172,l9mcwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mcwr/citadel_definitely_manipulated_the_gme_short/,103,1612156938.0,"I’m holding GME and a small position in SLV.  GME short interest is still at 113%. We can still squeeze it whether it’s Melvin or some other fund on the other side of the trade.

I posted about SLV and it went viral.  I’m not from citadel or any hedge fund for that matter. I’m a WSB peasant who has an account in the low 5 figures. 

I’m even dumb enough that I didn’t set up my position before posting about SLV so I had to chase calls after they went 10x the next day. I eliminated all chance of myself becoming the next DFV.  Look at my post history if you want to.  

I just don’t want this sub to become about conspiracy theories constantly.  I want trade ideas and I want yolos and we can’t become a 100% GME sub.  We need to hold GME to continue the squeeze. I totally agree.  But funds are going to be on your side or against you in any number of trades in the future, and other funds will be on the other side.  WSB tips the scales one or another, but the funds with existing positions are the pre-existing weights counterbalancing one another.  

Also here’s a video from last year when all of our spy puts got crushed by JPow announcing unlimited QE. It never broke through but I’m hoping it helps alleviate fears that somehow I’m some kind of citadel bot or something.

I used to be way more active in /r/wallstreetbets around this time last year, I just wanted to remind you newbies of the saying I saw every where here - FIRST ONE'S FREE.   
  
I decided to download Robinhood and take our $1000-2000 tax return and play the market using WSB. I was a 10/10 autist - slowly figuring out what a strike, expiration, call, etc is from context and Google. I was an autist so obviously I installed Robinhood and immediately applied to trade options. I started trading with the hope that we could pay my wife's college debt off - about $28,000. I didn't think it was realistic but 🤷‍♂️.  
  
It started off rough, I lost about $500. After that, things got great. Within a month of starting I had turned my couple grand into $8,700 with positions (mostly calls) in: AMD, Intel, Square, PLUG, the MEME STONKS of that time.  
  
I started to think damn, maybe I COULD make $28,000 to pay off this debt with. Then COVID19 wrecked fucking everything. My account dropped from $8,700 to $2,000 slowly over the next month.  
  
Some other retards got on here and convinced everyone of the TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR which would cause SPY or something to fucking BLOW. I remember almost going all in on that play and I was so glad I didn't - because nothing fuckin happened.  
  
After that I never really had the time to get back into it as my job got really busy due to covid and my wife and I were in the midst of transitioning to the ""vanlife lifestyle"" (its a very cheap/frugal way of life and you experience so much more). I wanted to get back into this with my little bit of buying power left today ($900) but just never made it priority.

Due to the influx of new people, the sub has turned into a mega echo-chamber and I feel we are missing answers to some key questions that would otherwise be answered by the 2 or 3 people here that actually fuck their own and our wives. 

It was explained over and over again that the shorts haven't covered (fuck them and the media for trying to say they did) and that the price can only go up as long as they haven't covered, because at some point, they have to. And that is fine.

Every single retard also has understood that 1000$ is in fact a meme, because we're not selling under 10,000$. Got it. 

What nobody has properly explained though is the *stability and confidence in the market and its rules*. There have been posts saying that Goldman is lying when they say the market could collapse, which I also understand. But can please someone explain to me and anyone else that might still have some further cash to dump into GME 
- Can they actually change the rules and freeze trading on GME or manipulate it otherwise?
- If they do, what implications would that have? (Can they do it legally? If they do it illegally like RH, can they get away with it and with what would that leave us?
- If what the IKBR guy has said is actually true and there is some potential for clearing houses and brokers to fail, what does that mean for our gains?

I don't care if this squeeze blows up the economy and the market, because it's not our fault but Wall St. fault. All I care is if the Tendieman will make it through the rough sea. I mean, Michael Burry got his money too when the market collapsed in 2008, right? I am 100% sure that without any fuckery, the squeeze has to happen.

The greatest WallStreetBets story of all time.,752,l9lpcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9lpcq/the_greatest_wallstreetbets_story_of_all_time/,99,1612155147.0,"I maintain that the epitome of WSB is /u/flopsie123’s accidental overnight ownership of $23,000,000 of SPY with a $50,000 account. The best part is that he came out of it with a $112,000 profit.

[Original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not/)

Almost three years ago, OP had tried to make a quick $2000 profit by selling barely-out-of-the-money Put option spreads shortly before those options expired. Happy with his quick cash, OP called it a day and didn't look at his phone again that night. In after-hours trading, the price of SPY dipped below the higher strike in the Put spread, allowing his counterparty to exercise their right to sell him thousands of shares of SPY at a profit. He got assigned 86,300 shares of SPY and had no clue until he checked his phone the following day.

The next morning, by sheer dumb luck, SPY opened above the strike price where he had been assigned the shares. It was dropping, but there was a small window of about 15 minutes during which his 86,300 shares, an embarssment of riches if there ever was one, could be sold for a profit. If SPY had opened lower, or if he hadn't noticed in time to sell immediately at the open, OP’s absurd level of leverage would have wiped him out and put him into serious debt. If those shares had been held through the end of that trading day, he would have owed $700,000.

What about the other option in the Put spread, the one he had bought to limit his exposure to SPY falling too low? Remember, the options were expiring on that day, so his protection expired that night as well, leaving him exposed for the open.

There’s a reason OP’s originally-intended trading strategy is sometimes referred to as “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.”

This post was peak WSB because it had everything - ill-advised risky trade, poor understanding of the forces involved, flaw in eTrade's risk management system, yet still manages to have a happy, autistic ending.

P.S. - OP had to pay interest to eTrade for owning millions of dollars of SPY, essentially on borrowed money. Apparently the interest on $23,000,000 overnight is $8000, so his actual profit was $104,000 before taxes.",2021-02-01 06:52:27

They’ve had the weekend to decide what they’re going to do. If I was in their shoes, allowing a game squeeze to 1000 and knocking the price down because they think people will sell is not a bad move for them to make.

Think about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still. we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow. The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK. It’s the way that GME gets squeezed. A realistic way is if we maintain hype. Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood. Remember that we are not actually organized. And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME. The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming. We need the eurobros to hold for us. They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind. Do not let them. Hold strong, hold steady, the squeeze has not happened yet. 

Diamond. Fucking. Hands.

Buy game at your own discretion, I firmly believe that shorts haven’t covered, and that the massive amounts of bots and MM is proof that they’re getting more worried by the day. We are winning.

I don’t have enough shares for one whole lot (less than 100). Does the rule that market makers have to fill odd lots at best price apply here? 

I don’t have a limit order now, plan on putting one when it gets closer to my ultimate target price of 40k. Laugh if you want. I’ve been screwed by shorters in weedstocks that drove prices down over 90% across the industry so I need 9900% gains just to get back to where I was. 

For the unfamiliar, all types of nefarious parties in the cannabis space would frequently short a stock and then buy into a raise at a discount to close their position shortly after. The biggest cannabis company curaleaf is built through the profits the founder’s investment fund made off shorting canadian cannabis. He actually bragged about his strategy on BNN Bloomberg.

So tldr I’m already jaded and willing to lose all as already have lost all. So will hold until Pluto or bust. Hence 40k target.

Thank you everyone for any insight.

ETA: I’m not asking about feasibility of a price above 10,000. I’m asking a practical question. 

What happens with a market order, can they fill it with a random bid below the current bid/ask?  I only have a few shares and hoping that using a market order at what I consider to be good time won’t screw me over somehow. Thanks!

ETA 2: I’m not expecting the price to stay at an elevated level for any length of time. Depending on trading action, I will of course adjust my lofty targets. I just wanted to know what happens in a one in a million type situation. That will last for maybe minutes, maybe half an hour and then crash down just as quickly.

I have seen a lot of posts discussing about holding shares of securities that have been shorted by big players in the market. I completely understand what that will do to those who have shorted the stock but I have been thinking about those people who have given their hard earned monies to these big players to invest on their behalf. Sure, Melvin and Citadel and the likes of them have done stupid things that has manipulated the markets for years but I wonder what you all think about the economy as a whole if these funds were to go down?   
I honestly have no idea who has given big dollars to these funds but wouldn't it be safe to assume that there are probably some pension funds, 401k, education, endowment funds held by them? While the decentralized power of WSBers has really got the entire financial markets spinning, I hope our actions would not result in a crash of markets due to a spiraling effect of these funds trying to cover their positions by selling other securities and creating the downward pressure in the markets.   
This also touches a bit on the moral side of the things where a few million of us here will benefit at the expense of world economies. Maybe I am completely wrong and hoping people around here would shed some light on this.

"NYSE tweet ""hghghg"" - Symbolic interpretation (Buy GME)",351,l9ldib,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ldib/nyse_tweet_hghghg_symbolic_interpretation_buy_gme/,67,1612154250.0,"Hg is the chemical symbol for Mercury.  

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

On most (all?) app the default type of buy order is the market order. 
Not something that should automatically be limited, but something easily exploited by current big fintech.

If you send a market order on a stock that has HFT short sharks waiting for you, they will see your order coming years in advance. Before your order even makes it to New York city, they will have bought every single ask between you and their highly overpriced ask.

Yes, it was your job to know all of this and now a shark is eating your dick, should have stayed out of the water, you intellectually challenged retail investor.

This is how they ""protect"" the retail investor see. It's just a simple, plausible, oversight at worst. And each investor will get bit only once, just a little nibble.

Just in the same way we buy our little 4 shares of GME, just once, no biggie. Protect the investors yes ?

If they wanted to protect the investors, the minimum they would have done is make the default a limit order of 110% of the current stock price.

Extended discussion

The supposed ideal market is a lie, it pretends equality of opportunity in the mechanics of the games however no such thing exists. Traders nearer to the exchange have ""latency privilege"" and can leverage this for a permanent edge over all other players. 

(journalists and politicians, understand this distinction, latency is the big deal, not the many trades per millisecond ones, if all participants had functionally the same latency, there would be no problem (well, there probably would be other problems))

Until the latency privilege is not functionally eliminated, there is no equality of opportunity in the market, the market is not a leveled playing field (duh, it will probably never be and to claim otherwise is ideology bordering on misinformation). 

TL;DR 

Send the latency supremacists to the gulags is what I'm saying, stop GME buys was not about protecting retail investors, because they did not care to do that beforehand, as shown in the very code of the broker's app. The stock market is a retail meat grinder which is fitting since it was designed from the beginning  to leech fat off from workers, so why not double dip and eat their savings too !",2021-02-01 06:33:41

HOW TO BYPASS GAMESTOP BUY RESTRICTIONS: EXERCISE CALLS,185,l9l4rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9l4rr/how_to_bypass_gamestop_buy_restrictions_exercise/,101,1612153591.0,"
mods pleas🚀PLEAS🚀🚀

This has been posted before but I think it’s VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We don’t know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction’s on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You’d want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the “To Break Even%”, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn’t how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs “$285” each.  You’ll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you’re exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isn’t ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH there’s a handy little “Exercise” button when you click on your Call.  You’d just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



I’m sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

It turns out we may owe the buy order to this guy - a freaking powerlifting viking which beat the shorts' algoritms at their own game.

*Disclaimer I own 23 shares of GME at 273 and I’m bull. This is not investment advice.* 

Are you wondering when, how, if this will all be over you’ve come to the right post. This ENDGAME DD is about no stock in particular and shouldn’t be taken as investment advice.

So your answer? If you haven’t seen this post please check it out. I think it does an ok job at theorizing the point at which a large short has to cover and how we get there.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme\_endgame\_game\_theory\_best\_scenarios/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/)

User does a great job explaining that there will be massive volatility if we are to go forward. There’s also a good theory of a pre-squeeze price and post-squeeze price where all holders make value $. No squeeze has happened yet, only a small exit of short positions leveraged back into more shorts.

Things the user forgot to mention as a strategy for someone bullish other than buy and hold.

*Other methods can be used to drive up prices.*

Remove your shares from the available short position!! **DO IT NOW then tell a friend**

GOOGLE SAYS: Phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place **your shares** for sale at, for argument's sake, double today's price. As they are 'on order' they **cannot** be lent out by your broker and in turn, you are reducing the amount of **'free shares**' out there that can be used for **shorting** purposes.

Shorts increased their position! [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) If you have **any** stock you want to increase in value, set a sell limit order for what you think is “fair value”, another thing brokers are limiting.

Buying accelerates the process way faster! 21 years is the estimate when they will be bust at current $300 value. I think it was an overestimate that can be much faster with buys. Buys with the conviction that the leadership from is now solid. Buys where you trust others to see the company and its stock growing. Buys because you like the stock. Anyone can buy, from almost anywhere! Asia, EU, Canada, US, find out if you can purchase too. 

**Taking away available shares to short and buying could reduce the estimate to an untenable short term position. Period**

The last thing not mentioned is a margin call. Oh did you invest on margin and over-leverage your position on GME like these hedge funds?  Prepare for an unexpected call when the clearing firm calls in and asks you to meet minimum deposit requirements or sells your position. However, this only happens if bulls are **quick and consistent**. Volatility needs to be so insane and price so high that shorts need to clear out and cut losses so quickly that they never have the capacity to short again.

The reason Robinhood said Fuck You, 1 share a piece was that their DTCC deposit/cash on hand requirements went way up. No speculation, just a fact. They, unlike other brokers, have 56% of 13 million known users who have a stake in heavily shorted Gamer Stock. In theory, if 30% more users bought 1 share of a $312 stock that would add $1,216,800,000 of value. Hedges lose long before that, but 56% is rookie numbers, we can get that to 99%.

Now read this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first)

In theory, just by buying and holding you could force Robinhood and other brokers to call in their investment from leveraged shorts. Ding ding ding. Three shitron lemons just flashed in a row and paid out. 

However, investing isn’t for everyone. Huge volatility for your one allowance of share can be involved. If you buy high and sell low that is as much of a loss as someone who shorted a position that was sound long term. My investment advice has always been only put in what you can lose, never 140%.

Buy a ticket to the show. They could sell out quickly. DVF bought 55,000 tickets at such a low price, but low is relative to what is the current high. 

Personally, I think $300 for your ticket to the show is a good deal for the ***HEDGIES LOSS PORN but you have to hold it to enter***.

DO NOT BUY SILVER!,26414,l9ksh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ksh1/do_not_buy_silver/,2782,1612152680.0,"Do not try to buy precious metals in the next week while China is celebrating the beginning of their Year of the Metal Ox. Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.

Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.

All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. 

Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. 

The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020’s pandemic market.

“Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,” Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop’s ticker. “While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.”

By Barclays’s tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

“We remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Deshpande said. “**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.”",2021-02-01 05:57:11

Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.

Tldr at bottom:

Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.

We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.

So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.

But what if their capital left?
The questions needed to be answered are

1.) ""what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. ""

2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).

3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?

4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?

I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. 

It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.

Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.

Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. 

Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods",2021-02-01 05:46:00

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has.

He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, "" The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient"". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

You see, I had a whole $260, an A in an undergrad portfolio class, and knew nothing about vaccines; it literally could not go tits up. A few days later, as biotech do, my cheese was cut and a thing of dreams.

After my cheese portfolio tanked, I though maybe the smart money was on to something. My YOLO didn't take me to the moon, but mooned me instead. Naturally, I joined the dark side. Closed my position, went to grad school, helped write textbooks, taught analysts, and went full corpro.

Mid pandemic, I said fuck it to my own fundamentals, and YOLO'd on myself by quitting. Though I can't have my time, girlfriend, or education money anyway now, I don't regret it for a minute.

I know that this is the way because you tendie trackers and the markets confirmed it. You took GME to the moon, penetrating billionaire portfolios. Ol' Yeller is back, now queen of the Treasury.

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world’s early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

🖐💎**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK 💎🖐**

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

🖐💎**SELL LIMIT ORDERS 💎🖐**

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an 🦍 holding a 🍌, the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your 🍌for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of ""$420.69 IS NOT A MEME"" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

🖐💎**TL;DR💎🖐**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be. 

Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k.",2021-02-01 05:15:40

I highly recommend everyone to take daily screenshots of their account until you have transferred to a different brokerage or closed all positions and cashed out.

I would also highly recommend doing this on a computer if possible, so that you can make sure all relevant information, including the name on the account, every stock/option you are currently holding, the total account value, and the date/time are all visible within a single image.

This may be the only way to protect yourself in the case that RH faces a liquidity crisis and takes all of your hard earned tendies. RH is insured up to $500,000, with up to $250,000 being cash.

EDIT: Because I just realized this, I also recommending downloading a statement, and overlaying it over the RH portfolio on your browser, so that you can also capture the account number and name. 2-factor authentication will go a long way if you end up filing an insurance claim when RH goes bankrupt.

EDIT 2: Many are suggesting screen recording apps for active trading during market hours. I will 100% be using such software and I stand by these posters and suggest everyone else uses these screen capture applications. I have seen AZ Screen Recorder recommended.

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I’m using says short squeezes aren’t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

I think I may have averaged about 3 hours of sleep per night, digging around the internet/twitter, following new developments, and trying my best to recognize what is actually happening here.

Millennials and relevant generations were set up for failure from the very beginning. Not only did the DotCom bubble hurt the parents of young millennials, also affecting them, but the ‘08 crash totally wiped out pensions and retirement accounts, sending most all the way back to square one.

During the ‘08 crash, many billionaires (who were already in the 1%) were made while the average person suffered. Since then, media coverage, guidance, and other forms of communication were heavily pushed out to the average investor to “help” them get back on track, while hedge funds and deep money in Wall Street were really commanding the ship.

What I’ve noticed these past few weeks is a rebellion from those suppressed (common man/woman) in the form of heavy concentration on a few securities. GME, BB, NOK, AMC and others are all we 🦍 focused on while the rest of the market was ignored. 

Futures didn’t mean shit on Friday, as GME closed ~135 points higher than it did Thursday. While this happened, shorts doubled down on the other meme stocks while limit buying ability was forced on a few brokerages. Cowardly illegal attack. However, what I saw was the mass waking up and ignoring the media, technical patterns, futures, and others means of manipulation used by Wall Street to create an emotional response within the common man. We are no longer paying attention to the tools Wall Street uses to drive the ship. In fact, us ignoring those manipulative “indicators” only makes our autistic power even stronger. 

This week, I am giving you homework. Your homework is to continue to COMPLETELY ignore the media, futures, social media posts, etc. Who the fuck cares if futures are down 10,000 points? That indicator only
matters if you’re a 📄🤚pig and sell your positions. We do not invest with emotion or paper hands anymore. WE decide what the stocks are worth and WE have each other’s backs, unlike the government who has handed out pennies to us on our taxed dollars.

So I'm curious on the process and how they are executed. I'm assuming I bought a stock and have a digital certificate to that stock. So what common sense would tell is that they will just transfer the electronic stock certificate via wire. I know there will be $75 charge on the senders end. Now will I lose that stock?

The Big Long: explained,17475,l9j2vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9j2vk/the_big_long_explained/,1290,1612148184.0,"Since WSB grew millions overnight, I see a lot of questions regarding GME, I'll try to answer those here. 

**1. What's happening with GME?**

The GME play is a very simple problem of supply and demand. Without having to explain what shorting is, just know that as long as short interest is over 100% the following applies:

- There are 100 sellers of GME
- There are 200 buyers of GME

We (retail/shareholders) represent 100 of the buyers above, the other 100 buyers represent hedge funds. The difference being that we already bought, hedge funds are still on the hook. 

Now, because of this, hedge funds want to buy for as low a price as possible and every day that they don't, they are paying Billions in interest. This tips the tables in our favour since we don't have to pay any interest for not selling. 

In a nutshell, if we don't sell, the price of GME can, theoriticaly, go to infinity.

**2. How can you participate?**

All you need to do is buy $GME with YOUR cash. On Thursday we saw what happens if you buy shares with the enemy's money (margin), they short attack to push the price lower and sell your shares via a margin call. If you have a reputable broker you can also disable lending of your shares to further limit the supply.

**3. What stage are we in?**

If you've seen The Big Short, we are in the stage where everyone realises the system is corrupt and the banks are scrambling to find a way to profit and not go bankrupt.

In this movie you are the ones betting that the housing market will go down and the hedge funds are the banks. The brokers (which disallowed buying of GME) are the rating agencies. 

**4. Is it safe to make this bet?**

In a non-corrupt free market buying GME while short interest is over 100% is a free money glitch. You're basically betting against corruption at this point in time.

History has shown corruption is rampant so do not bet more than you're willing to lose. Think of it as a donation against corruption that might get you a lot of money if you win.

**5. Is this what wallstreetbets is about?**

No, WSB is about taking risks and treating the market as a casino via the purchasing of derivatives (option contracts) in speculative plays. This is the first time in WSB history that buying shares is being advocated.

**6. Is this financial advice?**

No, I just really like the stock.

Let's talk about the theory behind using magic lines; Momentum in stocks can be somewhat predictable, and 'Elliot Wave Theory' depicts just that (Figuring out what a reasonable Price target to set and how long these rallies can push for is more complex and we wont talk about it.) 

Follow along as you look below: Stonks go, ""Up, dip, up, dip, up"" before going ""dump, bump, dump.""

 (When we are looking at GME charts below, imagine the charts are Starting right after the 'support' was found at the number '13' on the Long term trendline.)"")

&#x200B;

How do we relate this to GME? Bullishly, I would say we are about to enter the last 'impulse wave' (Top trend line in the picture above,) and that price movement on Monday/Tuesday this week will say a lot about how drastically this squeeze will truly be pushed upwards. (Rising wedge depicted below)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[If there is a dip into the 300-320 range in P-M, I would load there; if below $300 is broken, beware, as it very well may act as a neckline break of a H&S formation. With that said, I love that volume that can be seen picking up late Friday; another bullish look.](https://preview.redd.it/d6xbmnkoipe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b68b8faa4bf6a3342ca6910331053e24411324e)

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the *squeeze was very likely to be squoze* going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.

 (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)

[Think of it this way - without restricting buying, retail would've bought the PM\/opening dips like crazy, solidifying the first impulse wave & sending us off into another Gamma Squeeze\/Short-Squeeze combo. This was already AFTER the drop in the general markets on Wednesday, what I suspect to have been a result of big-boys liquidating longs.](https://preview.redd.it/e7ng28xsjpe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=704cd948d59d85cf149eba94ba49a60f1cfc6c0f)

Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

Possible GME Capital Raise Scenarios. I think Rights/Warrants Distribution Most Likely.,102,l9ixmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ixmn/possible_gme_capital_raise_scenarios_i_think/,184,1612147800.0,"**TLDR: Gamestop (the company) has not done anything since the stock surged - they've said nothing. The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they can’t do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they’d have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming.",2021-02-01 04:50:00

Tendietime, memes, 🚀emojis🤝💎, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

>""why didnt i buy earlier"", ""why didnt i buy more"", ""why did i not take out a fucking loan"".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

>""yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha""

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic ""I love you my lovely toilet-tiger"" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average.",2021-02-01 04:26:20

GME Dirty Tactics by Shorts 🌈🩳 ->🚀 💎 🤲,219,l9i9ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9i9ao/gme_dirty_tactics_by_shorts/,80,1612146048.0,"

Learn about the tactics that have been and will be used on GME

Prime brokers, hedge funds, broker dealers, and the DTC are all in bed together with the help of their friends in media I.e CNBC, WSJ etc. 

These financial institutions allowed illegal short sales of counterfeit shares and they’re about to receive a reckoning the likes of which have never been seen before. 

Beware of dirty tactics such as short ladder attacks, media assaults, and pulling margin away from long customers etc. in the coming weeks. For example, a short ladder attack is where they’ll tank the share price using counterfeit shares so the price you see is fake and not reflective of supply and demand, which will induce panic causing you to sell or so they hope. Similar to what we saw on Jan 28 when it moved from 450+ to 112. They want you to sell them your shares cheaply so they can get a free pass and unwind the mess they’ve created. Don’t fall for it. They would never give you a free pass so what reason do you have to give them one? 

They will have to buy your shares to cover their shorts so just 💎 🤲. **This level of short squeeze is unprecedented**. I don’t know how long it will take but it will happen. If you can, call your broker and request your shares not to be lent out. 

And if you haven’t seen this yet I highly recommend you watch this video where Cramer talks about how he manipulated the markets in 2006. At the time, the video was made for the internet and it “wasn’t supposed to go out to tv”. Little did he know the internet would become bigger than tv. 

Look up Cramer and Aaron task interview manipulation on YouTube

(I believe Ryan Cohen is expecting this - [look here](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934).) Excerpt from the Bloomberg article follows.

=================================

Happily, GameStop does have an ATM offering going. It put it in place on Dec. 8, 2020, when the stock was at about $16.35. The way these things work is that GameStop disclosed that its bank could sell stock—up to $100 million worth—“from time to time” at GameStop’s request “consistent with its normal trading and sales practices”; it did not disclose any particular schedule, and has not yet reported if any shares have been sold, or how many, or when. So I don’t know if GameStop had sold the whole $100 million before Friday’s wild run, or if it had any stock left over to sell; if it had any left over, I don’t know if it sold it all on Friday.

In fact, I am quite dumb. Right now 97% of my portfolio is in GME, the rest is PLTR leaps. All that follows is fan-fiction and speculation*

To understand what happened Friday you need to understand some things in the context of their timeline

**Tuesday**

*Regular Trading Hours*

options are still cheap. On Tuesday the price first broke over $100. You could buy 1/29 200c for $200 each (various times throughout the week those could have been sold for over $25k). the call volume was \*insane\*. so hopefully whoever sold those calls has the shares to cover them, right? Well, it turns out, most of the contracts were sold by *Market Makers (MM)* they literally make the market possible by providing the necessary liquidity to conduct trades. When MMs sell you options, they don't buy all the shares they need to fulfill that order. But if the option goes in the money, then they'd better have those 100 shares, because someone will be exercising it.

*Afterhours*

Price shoots up so all the options are in the money. \*oops\*

options up to 320 strike are added

**Wednesday**

*European Market*

the price is getting really high  🚀

*Regular Trading Hours*

Watching the order flow is like watching a battle take place. They have algorithms that are being used to try to push the price down, and things rapidly get bought back up. It's like watching someone try to keep a beachball underwater. The hedgies call their news buddies at CNBC, they make us out to be an alt-right white supremist group (fuck that, we don't talk about politics!) they call us irresponsible, they try to scare the retail investor and then make everyone think a selloff is happening so a sell-off does occur.

Well what they don't understand is they've been fucking training these **DIAMOND HANDS** since before October and November. The paper hands have already sold to us, you're not going to find paper hands by employing the same tactics you've been using all along. But I guess you're all out of options..

Anyway, they can't get the price below the highest strikes of $320, which is really bad for them.

*Afterhours*

Price maintains at high levels above highest strike of 320. new strikes added up to 590 (*? unclear on exact strike here and too lazy to look it up*) 

**EDIT the highest strike here seems like it should be $450. (thanks u/LBGW_experiment) I don't know where I pulled $590 from, like I said - fan-fiction. And I am a huge fan of this stock**

**Thursday**

*European Market*

the price is getting really high  🚀 You can bet the hedgies are watching it as closely as I am. Touching $450 there, crossing $500. it's low volume trading, but a strong indication of really positive sentiment. Well this is the day everything happened. And it makes sense, the hedgies REALLLLLLLY needed shares to cover all those calls that were in the money now.

*Regular Trading Hours*

How to do it, they think. So they twist everyone's arm and eventually figure they can scare off the retail investor by **BREAKING THE FREE MARKET**, allowing users to sell but not buy. C'mon...

The price is shooting up any way. The gamma squeeze of a century looks to be occurring, and it will trigger the short squeeze. Time to scare the retailer! BOOM circuit breaker after circuit breaker, people are rushing to outsell each other, and the bid is lowering to maintain a safely wide bid ask spread. **Very few shares are being exchanged**, but the price drops from about $450 to $125 in a span of about 35 mins. hedgies are selling short to each other and then selling the same shorts again a little lower to artificially drive the price down.

The plunge ultimately doesn't work to scare us, again bc   💎🤲 , but I suspect they were able to stop loss raid and people couldn't buy back in..

Overall, things are harder on Thursday, and we finish lower than Wed close.

*Afterhours*

I haven't gotten much sleep at this point, and I didn't watch AH very closely, so no comments here. Strikes up to 800 were added.

**Friday**

*European Market*

continued buying and strong price support. very strong sentiment.

*Regular Trading Hours*

So this is where the hedgies are really sweating. They've gone back to trying to keep the beachball below water and nothing is working. ""How did this not scare of the stupid peasant?"" they think to themselves and ask one another.

The last thing to consider, is that the MMs also made a lot of money on OTM options that expired Friday. They could use this to cover some of the losses from the options they sold earlier that 100x, BUT ONLY if they they were able to sell some options that expired OTM.

For this to happen is was **monumentally important** for them to defend the $350 price. I watched algorithmic precision carry out on the sell orders - it didn't look like there was much human selling (unless you are systematically opening up orders to drive the price down with low volume).

So now they've defended $350 hard all day, and they want to scoop up more profit from calls they sold at lower strikes. Thus begins a brilliant 2 hour long decline of carefully driving the price down. In my estimation, they are having a really hard time borrowing shares, and after that little stunt down to $125 on Thursday, they have to carefully allocate shares.

"This sub just bailed out two multi billion dollar companies on its own. Think about that. AMC secured $300,000,000.00 in new liquidity from the recent Reddit fallout, American Airline received $1.3 Billion.",16642,l9hnws,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9hnws/this_sub_just_bailed_out_two_multi_billion_dollar/,1066,1612144549.0,"This sub appears to have saved two companies from possible bankruptcy over the last week.

It’s important to realize that when you purchase a stock, the money you pay does not go to the company, it goes to the previous owner of that share. By buying stock you’re owning a (often) tiny piece of that company from someone else, unless the company itself did a direct stock offering their own. 

If you want to inject cash into a company the best way to do this is bonds which are basically loans, but this is WSB and no one is interested in a low risk return of 4% over half a decade.

AMC and AA were able to take advantage of the insane stock surge to offer new stocks, with which they received a cash injection of 300M and 1.3B over the last week respectively.

From Bloomberg News:

*“American Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $1.1 billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week.*

*Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company’s main creditors, also seized on AMC’s surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.”*

That’s insane, obviously there’s others buying shares but it started on Reddit, the momentum, hype, initial rallies..... led to the bailout of two multi billion dollar companies facing the very real risk of bankruptcy. Redditors probably just saved AMC and AA which is mind blowing to realize.

Even if everyone who has joined the GME train for a quick buck in the past few weeks pulls out next week, businesses and the huge mass of people who have the common sense to hold have already created a foundation for the squeeze to happen regardless.

This stock will be hitting $5000 by next Friday and there will be many that miss out.

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It’s a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced 💎🙌, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float.

We degenerate autist are a special breed. I think we have a chance to do something. I think we should create a Charitable Trust. We could weaponize our autistry for the good of mankind.
This idea is literally half baked but maybe we could run some paper trading contest, and take some of the top players, along with some experienced philanthropist (or is it philanderist?) to form the board of our organization. We could fund it with small donations, and multiply the effect by having our top autist invest the money (having proven themselves in our paper trading contest). We could start with u/DeepFuckingValue as a founding member of the board (I hear he wants to build an indoor track for his community as a start).
I would love to establish ourselves and then take on boomer Jim Cramer’s charitable trust in a trading contest, with the proceeds going to the charity of the winner’s choice.

Question: if every buys 1 share of a hypothetical company, let’s say $GME, the brokerages have different techniques to actually buy it. They could hold it for you, put it directly in your account, take your order and give you an IOU, all kinds. But it’s still 1 share. And you, the guy with smol leverage, are essentially the one holding it.


But if everyone had 20 bucks left over, why wouldn’t you use it on fractional shares of $GME. They are fractional to you but to the brokerages they probably have to hold the full/whole share to divide amongst the public. They are absolutely just held by the brokerage or some sub-holding company.

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I’m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note – What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you’ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL – Down 5.11% 

AMD – Down 7.7% 

BIDU – Down 7%

DOCU – Down 8.7%

F – Down 8.6%

PINS – Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don’t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR – Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

My question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices? This is not a sanctimonious question or a ""Will someone think about the boomers"" question.  What is the actual market short term and long term outcomes for folks not participating in this? As there are hedge funds getting ravaged behind the barn, there are plenty of other funds that are making a shit ton of money, buying in with their discretionary in the last few days.  There are two guys in WSB that I know who work for Canada based funds that are laughing. Ex-colleagues in fact. Yes, it's an uprising but it'll also be other already very rich people getting richer.

I can confirm with better than random certainty that in addition to GME, A LOT of other tickers are in the same position.

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

They are not my words alone, but the words of all. Thus, these words do not constitute financial or investment advise.* 

**In the Beginning**

In the beginning, the markets were created. They existed in relative balance and beauty, providing a means for investors to participate in the steering of the present towards a better future. This happened organically through investment choices. The markets were a tool that aided investors in fulfilling the measure of their being created, by allowing them to create their own world.

This balance and beauty began to crumble in time, as various individuals and groups of individuals  conspired to persuade and even control the decisions of investors. Over time, they would be successful through the deployment of unquestioned measurement metrics for value, and countless media campaigns. 

And here and now, we stand.

&#x200B;

**The Supermassive Black Hole**

The markets stand on the precipice of deconstruction. Like all things in existence, and much like the universe itself, nothing lasts in any single state. Deconstruction and reconstruction happen at every given moment, sometimes in small cycles, and sometimes... in revolutionary ones.

We are on the cusp of a moment unseen by any other generation before us. The markets begin their journey to a singular, previously invisible, stock. This is happening at an increased rate, and ALL parties feel its influence. 

Individual investors, traders, and gamblers are pouring money in by the droves. Larger institutions are doing the same. Even hedge funds, some of whom have doubled or even tripled down on their positions, add to the mass of this one security. 

News outlets continue to cover the story. Even the news that is hypothesized to go against this event, heads towards it and increases the power of its vacuum. This very post does the same, even without my mentioning the name of the security.

&#x200B;

**The Death of WallStreet**

The Supermassive Black Hole Event ends how all things end: deconstruction (death). This could happen slowly, or it could happen very abruptly. Many will attempt to escape it, but nothing can. This event cannot be stopped. It can only be delayed or change form. 

Eventually, when the mass becomes too great, hedge funds will be obliged via margin calls to liquidate their assets (their clients' assets), in order to repay their loans to the institutions from which their moneys were acquired. Not all clients, though, as some could theoretically be protected by moving their positions to select safety securities.

This is likely to cause a market downtrend, and eventually a crash. Again, this could happen slowly, very quickly, or at any pace in between.

SEC will no-doubt intervene. The US government will also do so. We will also see brokers intervene in an attempt to slow what is happening. These efforts will all contribute to the event. 

Though the person who gets out first mitigates the greatest potential loss, you'll find no admonishment in this prophesy to do so. The hedge funds and big money will attempt to do so, and are in the process of doing so.

This is the light that is shined before you, to show you who lurks in the corners and seeks to rob you of freedom through calculated steps to keep you in poverty!

&#x200B;

**The Birth of FreeStreet**

And lastly, I bring glad tidings. This event will happen, regardless of any efforts. In the end, there will be a rebirth of the markets, more free, balanced, and beautiful than ever before. Wealth will be redistributed to some degree, but that was never the point here. And most importantly, a we will see the dawn of a new age. An age where people democratically elect the future of their own time, and the legacy they leave behind.

He has a show on CNBC every weekday morning. He is well educated, level-headed, and very well informed. He also has contacts to every single large market player in the world.

&nbsp;

Dear David,

On Thursday morning there was a level of market manipulation that occurred on an unprecedented scale. Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements. The DTCC has not said anything publicly; however, they have leaked it was their lenders who raised rates suddenly on them forcing these changes. The banks in question are the money center banks such as J.P. Morgan.

&nbsp;

**Counter party risk in the system**

The banks did this because of counter party risk in the system. In layman's terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine. Bring on the banks, DTCC, and others involved to explain this to everyone. Wall Street is at risk of turning two entire generations against them because of the actions last week. Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.

&nbsp;

**Loss of capital**

The big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation.
This has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated. 

&nbsp;

**Yelling fire in a crowded theater**

There are many who don't think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and **NOT**buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.

&nbsp;

**Final Notes**

I have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop ""movement"". Guests were angry, dismissive, and frankly rude to these dumb millennial traders putting money in Gamestop. This has to change if you want the next generation to join the market like yours has, and the one before them.",2021-02-01 03:13:59

This is a small piece so you should be able to kick your brain into overdrive and read around 25 percent of the words.

I wanted to let anyone unaware know that there will be sections of Wall Street also profiting off of this GME event. It's okay, nothing wrong that. In fact, you very much need them.

Please, do not be disillusioned into thinking retail buying power alone is enough to sustain the GME craze. You need Whales(billionaires on your side) and you need good Hedge Funds. For instance,
Black Rock owns 14 percent of GME and is making a killing. 

This might make you angry if your mission is to destroy Wall Street. That was never the intended goal from the beginning. The goal was to hit short positions where it hurts for their shitty and sorry tactics of profiting from the bankruptcy of companies. Who cares if hedge funds make money from companies prospering and growing? That's kind of the point of the stock market and the same reason you should invest.

I thought it important to raise awareness that retail investors are HURTING(in a good way) specific funds, and helping others. Such is life.

This shit will be crazy if it squeezes, don't get caught holding the bag.

I have a noob question about the markets and our situation with GME. Imagine all of us regards won't sell our stonks below 69420$. Something very high. Small Melvin will not be able to put up this huge amount of cash, not even if the lender liquidates all their assets. What happens in that case? What happens if the price increases further and further and shorts aren't able to close their position? At some point, somewhere, some rules are going to get broken, right? Because this is a situation that should not happen and somehow can not happen. So what is going to happen to retail? Will the lender make some kind of deal with Melvin? Usually if you can't pay your debt, you will default into bankruptcy. And what is going to happen when shorts go bankrupt? Who is going to buy back the shorted positions? I assume it's no one, rules will be broken and the small retail trader without any lobby will pay the mess. 

To be honest, I don't have much knowledge about the finance industry, so this was going around my head - maybe someone with greater knowledge could tell me what is going to happen next?

Please don't get me wrong and downvote me - I am trying to understand the chances and risks of this play and also the greater picture. Because usually the big capital wins and not the retail pleb. As you can already see, rules are changed mid game because it simply ""can't"" happen that the big ones fail and retail wins. It is not intended to work like this, the system. So maybe I am completely missing something - can you discuss with me and help me understand?

Why wouldn’t Melvin cover...,52,l9g6zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9g6zh/why_wouldnt_melvin_cover/,204,1612140612.0,"Why wouldn’t Melvin and company cover when they (allegedly) manipulated the stock to dip to 126... why wouldn’t they buy massively itm call options with a .99+ delta to exercise for 100 shares a pop and massively otm call options to make back their losses as the stock popped when their (alleged) manipulation wore off?

It seems like a no-fucking-brainer. If they manipulated they knew it would spring back... it would have cost them essentially pennies to buy 300 strike call options for that week. They could have stood next to the MM while he made them, using the MM as a middle man waiting for retail to buy them for a premium to get clapped. Hell, they could have rode puts down to 126 too... there’s only a few options:

1) they didn’t manipulate and have no idea what’s going on so they didn’t want to double down in any direction.

2) they did manipulate and are dumb as fuck about where that would bring the price. 

3) they did manipulate and they did cover with options and are prepping to clap retail

NVAX Part II: Outlook Beyond the Fortnight,182,l9fs4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9fs4x/nvax_part_ii_outlook_beyond_the_fortnight/,132,1612139481.0,"I tried to [tell](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l22qez/nvax_a_fortnight_bottlenecks_and_imminent/) you all a week ago what was coming. I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me ""I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%"" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

https://preview.redd.it/diljgsjmxoe61.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0e94718b1185709f44d2de968aec6e566c4aa6

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see.",2021-02-01 02:31:21

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it’s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it’s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn’t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was “bot” propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

Since most brokers blocked exercising 0 dte calls on Friday. Would it be possible to exercise OTM calls before they expire for someone who doesn’t care about taking a loss just in order to obtain shares?

Ex: 

Retard has a 2/9 $400 call, and say by 2/8 gme isn’t above $400 (say it’s trading at $350) and there’s a possibility the call will expire worthless

retard exercises $400 call on even if gme is trading at $350, retard obtains 100 shares at a cost of $40,000 netting a $50,000 loss due to the current share price of $350.

Now this retard has forced the seller of the call to issue the 100 shares to him rather than having his call potentially expire worthless. Now this retard can hold onto the shares until the short squeeze can occur.

TLDR: Exercise the OTM calls rather than having them expire worthless if you have the cash and are willing to hold the shares. GME 🚀 (not financial advice)

More than 4 million people joined the sub this week, do you know the kind of power we have? Wallstreetbets IS Wallstreet. We are the captain now. This is our ship and we are not letting those little hedge fund fucks take over our money. No one fucks with wsb.

Hedge funds have 48 hours to prepare for the reckoning on Monday and they think we will be sleeping with our cocks out. Not a fucking chance. We will have our cocks out alright but in their wife's mouth. wsb has no breaks we will never stop until we are on the moon. We are planning out our new civilization on the moon and no one can stop us.

We the autists of the best community on Reddit like this stonk. Elon Musk like this stonk. The world like this stonk. Tomorrow when we take this stonk to the moon we can wave back to the normie hedge funds on earth and dump our pp poo poo on them. Lets make this section in future history books a glorious one. 

See you fuckers on the moon.

Melvin Capital ends month with over $8 billion in assets after investors added cash,438,l9ez8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ez8j/melvin_capital_ends_month_with_over_8_billion_in/,147,1612137232.0,"**TLDR: Rich clients invested more money to feed the beast. Hold strong**

BY REUTERS — 8 MINUTES AGO
By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

BOSTON (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop (GME) drama, **lost 53% in January** but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, a source familiar with the fund said on Sunday.

Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets, the source said.

The firm, founded in 2014 by Gabe Plotkin, had bet that ailing video game retailer GameStop's (GME) stock, which traded at less than $5 five months ago, would fall. But a wave of retail investors, comparing notes on social media platform Reddit and using online trading app Robinhood, took the other side of Plotkin's trade to send the stock up 1,625% this month to close at $325 on Friday.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss.

Hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel gave a $2.75 billion capital infusion to Melvin Capital earlier in the week, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss.

""The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong. Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014,"" the source said.

As news of losses at many hedge funds spread in recent days, speculation mounted about which firms might be forced to shut their doors. Several investors and fund managers said clients have been more patient with certain firms that have a long and strong track record, likely allowing them to survive this month's deep losses.",2021-02-01 01:53:52

This is a game of chicken where reality tips greatly in our favor.

1. It costs absolutely nothing for us longs to hold onto our positions. Guess who has to pay to hold onto their positions?

2. Shorts can only try to shake us but the more they pressure us, the more our hands get encrusted in diamonds. Shorts can keep trying tricks but we have our own whales to see through them, meaning every dip is a discount and eventually, we will shake off all paper hands.

3. This collective will attain diamond hands. It is a matter of when not if. You have people who have nothing left to lose, betting everything they have on a chance to change their lives. You have people who are here just to make a point. You have degenerate gamblers who flip the finger to risk management. You have people who are just here for entertainment. These people are willing to see their money drop to 0 and this crowd is going international.

The only way out of this situation is to unwind the short interest and better now than later. If the shorts go bankrupt, as a broker, you are on the hook. Better close those short positions while the losses are limited to the shorts. Maybe you're enjoying the interest from loaning our shares out but the goal is to bust the shorts and we don't mind you being collateral damage (especially those specific few of you, you know who you are).

I’m a smooth brain fuck but even I can see on January 27th bulls moved the stock to $8.83 from $5.87 a change of over 50%. FFS, if that’s not moving the stock I don’t know what is. Does that sound like an unmovable object?

There are a couple reasons we came down from that high so quickly, retail/institutional shorts were crawling all over this thing and the next day we were RESTRICTED from buying. I think there’s a lot more shorts on this than previously anticipated. Diamond hands are needed here as well as access to the open markets owe can buy and hold.

Volume is trending upwards recently as well. With a record setting day on the 27th.

Look, I cant do the level of DD some other people do on here and others have done a great job pointing out the positives, so I’m not going to beat a dead horse. All I know is NOK is sitting near multi-year lows (like some other famous stocks were recently), its volume is picking up immensely (like some other famous stocks recently), its based in nostalgia(just like some of the stocks that went up recently) and its getting a lot of publicity which makes my pants feel kind of tight.

It has not yet popped, not even in the slightest. Don’t just cast it out of your mind because you think its worthless. That’s the same shit people did to GME when u/deepfuckingvalue mentioned it a year ago. Now those same people are eating crow while he’s bathing in fucking tendies. Will this be the same as GME? No, GME was a special catalyst. Could NOK double or quadruple in a year? Yes, absolutely. Isn't that worth a look?

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** 🚀🚀✅

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$8.8 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** 💸💸💸

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares.

Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund that has borne the brunt of losses from the soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks recently, lost 53% in January, according to people familiar with the firm.

Melvin was founded by Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen. It started the year with about $12.5 billion and now runs more than $8 billion. The current figure includes $2.75 billion in emergency fundsCitadel LLC, its partners and Mr. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management injected into the hedge fund last Monday.

As part of the deal, they got non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. So far, Citadel, its partners and Point72 have lost money on the deal, though the precise scope of the loss was unclear Sunday.

Melvin has massively de-risked its portfolio, said a client. People familiar with the hedge fund said its leverage ratio -- the value of its assets compared with its capital from investors -- was the lowest it has been since Melvin's 2014 start. They also said the firm's position-level liquidity, or its ability to exit securities in its portfolio easily, had increased significantly.

New and existing clients have signed up to invest money into Melvin on Feb. 1, according to the people familiar. It was unclear how much they would be adding.

Melvin had established itself in recent years as one of the top hedge funds on Wall Street, but a short position in GameStop Corp. hurt the firm in recent weeks. Losses extended beyond GameStop, with declines coming from throughout its portfolio during a period of market turmoil in January. Positions in which Melvin had publicly disclosed owning put options -- bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall -- in its last quarterly regulatory filing soared, while positions in companies it held sold off.",2021-02-01 00:28:57

GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed,220,l9d24j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9d24j/gme_share_price_moving_forward_after_the_shorts/,197,1612131243.0,"Hi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.

I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:

a. We all know why GME price 🚀, due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly

b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from 🚀 - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders

c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.

So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.

When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price 🚀 

Sorry for rambling im using all my powers from 2 hour sleep. Pls fuck me up if my monke 🐒 brain anal ysis is wrong.

My thoughts why the GME rally could possibly be over already.,0,l9d1rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9d1rj/my_thoughts_why_the_gme_rally_could_possibly_be/,128,1612131208.0,"Hello,

so I am not paper handing, I have bought 100 shares in November and am still holding, though, I build too much suspicion over this weekend and I would love you guys t actually counterargument my thoughts, just so that I feel better.

Here are my thoughts why GME might already be over:

1.we don't know the real shorting numbers and the HF might have covered most of their positions already:

all the numbers that were presented on twitter & co are just guesses/were calculated by algorithms. Hedgefonds aren't dumb, they know how to outsmart these algorithms so that it looks like they are still holding their positions (this way they can short the stock again, before official numbers are published and make money). They had a lot of time to cover their positions in small quantities by now. Why would they just keep holding on their positions to cover them at the highest price? The short squeeze hasn't happened, that's for SURE. BUT: maybe it won't happen anymore, because they are prepared, because they covered most of their positions in the last week in smaller quantities (because they weren't ever forced to do it all at once, the price simply wasn't high enough, that was the case in the VW squeeze).

We have seen that the hedge funds have learned, for example, there was no gamma squeeze, they covered their positions early enough, not like the week before.

2.too much attention

don't get me wrong, attention is great, but maybe this whole thing is already done, because we had too much attention. Even porn stars have tweeted about gme by now, and I know out of experience that this often means a change of trend in a stock.

3.a lot of instability, just small bad news are a possible catalyst for a free fall

there is nothing that protects us from a free fall, and this would definitely mean the end for this story.

If there's truly a conspiracy about silver, it's not the bullion. Buying silver (and gold eventually) is something you can't go wrong with. Silver is seriously undervalued and its price is being manipulated down. You see, being long precious metals is basically shorting the dollar. And with the money printer going brrrr there's no doubt that inflation is going brrr aswell.

It's fucking BLATANT how the price is manipulated. Silver is supposedly a trillion market, but the actual silver that's on the surface is much, much less than that. T**here is likely LESS fine silver bullion on the surface than there is fine gold bullion.** Why ? Because we humans use much much more silver than we use gold for industry. Yet we don't extract much much more silver.

Thing is, we've been shown that markets can't be trusted. $SLV is just fucking paper. It's nothing. It's not something that'll get bullion delivered to your house.

"Account Transfer: If you ACATS transferred out of RH, you have ""locked"" your shares for T+2 days...what will happen to GME...",100,la3gwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la3gwo/account_transfer_if_you_acats_transferred_out_of/,35,1612216246.0,"Too Long Can't Read: HOLD GME!!! 🚀🚀🚀🌙

First, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody. 

With everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts. 

I noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages. 

I have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still ""free"" trading. 

Secondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for ""transferring"" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub..

Thirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf.

Lastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to ""settle"". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue...

But broneilbro...what does this mean for GME? Well, kid...

1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH 
> ""If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep."" https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/** 

  These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees...

2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be ""off the table"" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive ""group"" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play.

3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general ""pause"" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view. 

4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms. 

Just my thoughts on everybody fleeing RH...there will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...

TLDR: HOLD GME!!! 🚀🚀🚀🌙 <Almost forget these...>

We should be compiling links of sources claiming WSB is for silver,18578,la3ddb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la3ddb/we_should_be_compiling_links_of_sources_claiming/,969,1612215936.0,"We’re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. 

This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don’t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.

If there was any doubt of these hedge fund’s influence and manipulate, this whole “WSB going silver” just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.



**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **""There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members""**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.

This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.",2021-02-01 23:45:36

UPDATE 1-Hedge fund body alarmed by retail investor frenzy 'distortions'

2021/02/01 03:12

By Huw Jones

LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street's retail trading frenzy has distorted markets, global hedge funds industry body AIMA said on Monday, adding it was concerned that lawmakers were encouraging such moves.

Retail investors gathering in social media chatrooms like Reddit have been driving up the price of stocks like GameStop GME.N shorted by hedge funds, with the focus shifting to other parts of the market on Monday, such as silver.

""What is dangerous, amid this trading frenzy, is that retail investors have been chasing prices so far above any sane valuation and that many will end up nursing losses,"" AIMA CEO Jack Inglis said in a letter to members, who manage $2 trillion.

""The role of some supposedly responsible lawmakers, who have been cheering these events from the side-lines, with a knee-jerk reaction against short selling, is concerning to say the least.""

U.S. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said last week that people felt ""everyday people"" were finally able to ""get back"" at those who had all the marbles on Wall Street and forced once hedge fund into an existential crisis. nL1N2K423J

Inglis said finger wagging at hedge funds was not new and short-selling is tightly regulated, requiring positions to be published, allowing others to trade against them.

Some hedge funds have chalked up losses and AIMA said it will help with regulatory investigations.

""Those exposed will have taken it on the chin and will have executed steps to contain losses for their clients, whose savings they manage,"" Inglis said, adding:

""To those commentators who have been clapping with glee at the misfortune of those hedge funds ... what we have witnessed in the past week is a game that has led to a gross distortion in both efficient market functioning and true price determination.""

This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.

1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)
2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that).
3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares
4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market).
5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares
6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock.
7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)
8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.

&#x200B;

TLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.

So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.

We saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy & Tech were the biggest losers. 

So, let’s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It’s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.

We also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits & compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.

Meanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.

This week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google & Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm & Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021🚀🚀🚀, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla’s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.

Meanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn’t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks & Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites🚀🚀🚀.

The recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) 🚀🚀🚀, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than ¾ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.

Interactive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.

So… I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second… this one is very hard to predict… Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven’t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.🚀🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).

It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.

Shorts Playbook,246,la2kcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la2kcw/shorts_playbook/,36,1612213355.0,"Second time posting....hopefully the mods approve:

Hey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by [u/MarioBuzo](https://www.reddit.com/u/MarioBuzo/) and offer a high-level version for those in the trenches. Basically, you're not only fighting the shorts, but the media (surprise!), the DTCC and its clearing agents while the regulatory bodies remain indifferent (complicit?). As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below.

1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursday’s dip in GME’s shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as “strategic fails-to-deliver” and is basically given a pass by the SEC.
2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies.
3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency.
4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?)

The short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion.

I highly suggest reading the articles because I’m only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.

TLDR: HOLD! 🚀",2021-02-01 23:02:35

A Torah based stock prediction algorithm using Judaism concepts,0,la2au9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la2au9/a_torah_based_stock_prediction_algorithm_using/,18,1612212475.0," *After unsuccessfully trying to discover--astrologically--a way to find something to improve the risk/reward ratio of this algorithm. I decided to turn to the Torah for help.*   
*""At the end of every seven years, you shall celebrate the remission year. The idea of the remission year is that every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and brother when God's remission year comes around. You may collect from the alien, but if you have any claim against your brother for a debt, you must relinquish it...."" (Deuteronomy 15:1–6)*

*The correlation between Jewish Sabbatical years and major declines/crashes in stock prices is heavily studied. In the Judaism tradition, the number 7 holds great significance. Shabbat is observed on the 7th day of a 7-day cycle, the shmita or sabbatical year is observed on the 7th year of a 7 year cycle, and the Jubilee year is celebrated at the end of seven cycles of shmita.*  

*I found a way to apply this concept of ""every 7th year"" to the algorithm and further improve its risk/reward profile. What I did was simply reverse the parameters of the algorithm during every 7th year of a 7 year cycle. Whereas normally, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector would mean the prediction of a market decline--now, in making use of the ""every 7th year"" concept by reversing the algorithm only during the 7th year, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market rise and vice versa... the sun traveling through a Dow rise prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market drop.*

* There could be a ""bug"" that accidentally replaces ""too high"" limits with ""market price"";

**PUBLISHED**JAN 29, 2021 8:00AM EST

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A new class action lawsuit filed in the Central District of California alleges that behemoth online brokerage, Robinhood, breached its duties to investors when it ""willfully and knowingly"" disabled certain crucial and basic trading functions crippling its clients' abilities to trade from their accounts.

Main Street Investors

 The complaint alleges that Robinhood clients who owned, or sought to acquire, shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), were damaged when Robinhood deliberately handcuffed their ability to trade, thereby benefitting Wall Street institutions.

According to the lawsuit, ""Robinhood, famous as the champion of the small retail investor(…) Switched sides."" The complaint further states that ""Robinhood acted contrary to the interests of its clients and anointed itself as the overlord of the free market, opting to damage its clients in favor of its own financial interests and the interests of other market participants, many of whom had interests directly adverse to Robinhood's clients."" The suit asserts causes of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence and Unfair Business Practices, among others.

The case is Gossett, et al. v. Robinhood Financial, LLC, et al Case No. 21-cv-00837. The Plaintiffs are represented by Maurice Pessah of Pessah Law Group, PC (PLG) and Stuart Chelin of Chelin Law Firm, two Los Angeles based law firms.

Help-out-a-billionaire thread,223,la1oop,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1oop/helpoutabillionaire_thread/,72,1612210169.0,"You know, traditionally r/wsb smooth brain has been a simple animal with a heart of gold. If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.

But the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.

I was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.

u/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.

u/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.

Many people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.

That's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.

Or perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.

But if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, ""maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career.""

This is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.

Personally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.

Now, I know what you guys are thinking: ""hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!"" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.

But I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?

I am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.

In this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice ""lazy"" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.

Edit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention. 

If even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day. And it won't cost us a penny.",2021-02-01 22:09:29

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",2021-02-01 22:08:11

Possible (real) reason brokers are restricting buys on GME.,224,la1ljj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1ljj/possible_real_reason_brokers_are_restricting_buys/,84,1612209825.0,"We wsb have many roles in this GME saga. One of them is the detective. It is up to us to figure out the crime and the weak point of the criminals behind the counterfeit stocks. 

Here is a brief history of the crime. 

1. Some hedge funds naked short GME and disguise as normal shorts in the system. This pushes short interest to 140%. This everybody agrees on. 

2. DFV see this and starts a manic squeeze.

3. Massive shares bought by wsb and no doubt other funds.

4. As prices rose these buy trades start to fail, ie the seller fails to deliver the shares to the buyer after 2 days in settlement. You can see the volume on SEC fails website. Some guy tallied up to 1.5m shares failed when price was 10 in december. You can use your imagination what is the fail count at price 350. Note above 10,000 fails gets the stock on SEC watch list. 

5. Because these shares failed to deliver, RH and all brokers faced a sudden margin call from clearing. Why? Simple, RH clients bought shares that are simply not turning up. So RH is essentially short GME stock to its customers. Hence has to post 100% margin instead of 2% and likely the normal interbank loan channels are closed for this high risk purpose. 

6. What can brokers do? They can enforce a buy-in. That means they can force the seller to buy the missing stocks in market using funds in the shorts' account. The US buy-in rules are pretty complex but i understand that it is up to the buyer to enforce a buy-in. Ie RH has to initiate the buy-in.

7. What happens at buy-in? They bid for the volume at any price. The naked shorter goes bankrupt expending all their fund networth to buy stonks that dont exist from people who dont like them. 

So key question is this. When will RH and all brokers enforce the buy-in and why are they not doing it right now?",2021-02-01 22:03:45

BOOM (DMC Global) Fundamentally exposed opportunity due-dil #DYOR,6,la18kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la18kt/boom_dmc_global_fundamentally_exposed_opportunity/,12,1612208435.0,"Hey everyone!

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren’t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I’m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk’s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn’t invent this stuff. If you’re in this to change Wall Street, let’s break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it’s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **“How big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?” and “Who’s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?”** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It’s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn’t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn’t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn’t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won’t take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn’t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it’s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won’t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let’s make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let’s change the world, one BOOM at a time!

* [**Activate Real Time Quotes**](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/how-to-get-real-time-quotes) \- you need to acknowledge some stuff that was too long and I didn't read. If you don't do this, you're 15 minutes behind.
* [**Activate Extended Hours Trading**](http://personal.fidelity.com/webxpress/help/topics/learn_extended_hours_trading.shtml) \- Fidelity requires you speak with customer service and they talk about the risks of extended hours trading.
* **Trading on margin** \- you can call them to set up a margin trading agreement, but I don't recommend that because I'm an index fund boomer at heart.
* **Sell Limit Rules** \- Not that any of us would ever sell a stock we like so much, but Fidelity allows Sell Limits to be placed only 50% over the latest price. So we're gonna have to get well beyond $40k for us to be able to enter our $69,420.69 sell limits.

""An early peek into our algo reveals a decline in GameStop shares shorted, as short sellers trim and liquidate their holdings. Our analysis suggests a decrease in overall shares shorted, dipping below the 30 million share level. (Watch this space for more analysis tomorrow.) Moreover, S3 data reveals that trading in the latter part of the last week gave short sellers exit points below GME’s high water mark levels and reduced their mark-to-market losses. A portion of Friday’s gains can be attributed to short sellers buying-to-cover shoulder-to-shoulder with long shareholder buying.""

AMC and GME are following exact same patterns.

This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

&#x200B;

And of course, I am only telling you this because I like this stonk :).

Edit: I am all in on GME shares holding from 130.

Edit 2: no need to message me. Not a financial advisor. If you are worrired about any of the stocks on here the best thing to do IMO is to hold.

Edit 3: this is a short ladder. Just buy up paper hands and hold forever.

Edit 4: Check out the frontpage. 

""If you see GME falling quickly without volume , this isn't actual selloff of GME shares but a tactic of hedge funds to scare you into selling GME.

After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of ""Wallstreetbets taking over silver"" and ""Shortage in silver supply"".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance ""Xtrackers physical silber"" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.

>Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

-
>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

-
>When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

Long explanation: [Counterfeiting Stock 2.0
](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)

>Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.

-
>Why is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.

(...)

-
>The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.

-
>The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.

>It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.

Evidence of Massive Naked Short Selling Fraud in GME and AMC,6,l9z88h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9z88h/evidence_of_massive_naked_short_selling_fraud_in/,3,1612200012.0,"First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the [original DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (""It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!""), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**

Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)

Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock,18444,l9ywyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ywyz/things_to_remember_on_monday_if_you_hold_gme_stock/,954,1612198715.0,"# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules.

_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I
am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at
the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for
memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_

**

THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**

**

When?**

Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out
(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks
time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (I’ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I don’t trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
that’s already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =  $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasn’t the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didn’t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)
continue to push the narrative: “Throw Melvin & Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.”**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the “top” of a
squeeze. (It’s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
What’s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I’ve been on WSB long enough
to know that WSB’s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a “GAMMA SQUEEZE” which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school – Essentially telling him, “HEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.”

 

**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it’s no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, it’s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by “MaRkET MAkInG”.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a façade that I will “rationally” hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to “STICK IT TO THE MAN” because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I’ll
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And I’ll also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there’s 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it’s
done, they’ll even make you feel bad, saying you were “Greedy” and “Reckless”,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there’s still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they’re getting is piss and
pre-cum.

 

**

APPENDIX – Ortex & S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, it’s literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because I’m up for 4AM pre-market (don’t fucking judge me, I’m a retard too).

So I’ll explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I don’t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if they’re still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, here’s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife’s
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.

This is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.

**Their strategy is probably something like this:**

They are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?

Because they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? ""Reddit did it.""

After they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.

They want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.

Anyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.

Yes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.

If you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.

TL;DR

Banks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.",2021-02-01 18:41:34

My Hot Take on the Influence Citadel has over what Collateral Prices the DTCC/NSCC Sets,99,l9ylma,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ylma/my_hot_take_on_the_influence_citadel_has_over/,18,1612197365.0,"Elon Musk laid an epic smackdown to Citadel while grilling Vlad the Stock Impaler from Robinhood in the clubhouse stream that just went down.

TLDR for the Article: Citadel has a huge dong so the NSCC better do what they want.

I'd be willing to bet they can swing their dong around to influence how much cash the NSCC gets to basically make up whenever they want. So Robinhood usually needs 50-300million on hand, NSCC says nah bro now you need 3 billion unless you shut that shit down.",2021-02-01 18:36:05

Dear Fidelity Investments,36,l9yinq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9yinq/dear_fidelity_investments/,26,1612197018.0,"  Just wanted to say you are my favorite broker and it's been tough sending you business once you turned off fractionals for GameStop and possibly other shares. I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.

There's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.

As a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?

There's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.

If there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?

If you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off. 

Here's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.

Neither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked.

Disclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?",2021-02-01 18:30:18

I just wanted to say how blown away I am by what's happening. Last year, I was heavily invested (most of my portfolio, not smart I know) in GNUS which ended up getting fucked by and over-shorted by Citron resulting in heavy losses. I was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital. I was forced to pull back from trading because I couldn't sustain the loss. I'm 22 with a tax bill and a business that's on hold due to covid so I can only take so many losses. Another year, another opportunity for a bounce-back hopefully.  I genuinely believed in the company and went long but then Citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad PR and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down. I remember seeing teachers, firemen, and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason.

They tried to do the same with GameStop but you guys didn't let it happen. This genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes.

I'm playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation, explaining what's going on, where to buy GME and why these institutions deserve the punishment they're getting. It's working!!! Excited to be back in the game once I hopefully get the business up and running after covid.
