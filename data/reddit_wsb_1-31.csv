They don’t care about their employees. I worked at one for 5 years and got a raise of $1....over those 5 years. They tell you over and over “yeah you’ll get full-time and benefits....SOON.) while they give you more responsibilities and less compensation.

They don’t care about their customers either. They pay you pennies for your valuable stuff and sell it at an EXTREME profit. They push over-priced thinkgeek shit on you. You are nothing but $$$$$$$$ to them. 



Their leaders have been more than content to ride this company into the ground over the last ten years. They get paid great and will find other executive jobs, they have no stake in the company.

They’re just as greedy and manipulative as the shorters and don’t deserve your business when this is all said and done. If you want to give back, go into your local stores and give to the employees directly. 

They were perfectly happy to ride to bankruptcy. Remember when they were a laughing stock of the community? That was a for a good reason and nothing has changed.

Tldr; my 2-year ape doesn’t clean up his toys, no ice cream for dessert. my 2-year-old does cleanup, then ice cream for dessert. Oh no, I ran out of ice cream. What do I give my toddler if he does good? \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

This is not investment advice. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m not a robot with a big dick. It’s kinda smallish.

So yesterday, 1/29, I blew up my Robinhood portfolio. I let my people in arms down by selling my 200 GME shares and I undersold a deep ITM CALL. The pressure from the delta hedges and the world was too much to bear. I should have just kept my browser open to WSB or kept my phone off. I think I made 10K for the year (after BS taxes) and 100’s of hours of learning how to invest. Gains are gains but I still feel like shit right now. I missed the boat / rocket again.

This morning I had one of those shower epiphanies. I started off thinking about what my strategy will be going into this week but then I got thinking about the whole economy in general. Everyone pretty much knows money is just a made-up commodity. What really matters is production. How can we get to Mars or outer systems? Production. What is stopping Tesla from producing more cars? Battery production. And what is production but the output of work from people?

Back in the ancient days, money didn’t exist. Work output was rewarded with necessities like food and drink, shelter. Ape climbs trees to get bananas for the community of apes. How should other apes reward that ape? Maybe give a bigger pie of bananas to that one ape? You do work. Here’s your bread for the week. You do better work, here’s your juicy steak.

I played this game called Guild Wars that uses a multi-monetary system. One of those tradeable commodities is Karma. My proposal is that the US government (or maybe the world government) update their system to include something that will act like Karma. At first, I was thinking that they could use \*\*\*\*\*\*\* but that might not be feasible because it cannot be regulated. But then again, maybe that’s what is needed. Who should determine what work output is worth? Maybe the apes that received that output?

I think some governments and corporations are implementing this already (sorry, I’m not an economist). Basically, on your pay stubs, you’ll receive money as well as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Or maybe you can choose what percentage of your pay should be in money and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*? And even if you don’t choose what percentage, the government/corporation or your ape community will reward you with some \*\*\*\*\*\*\* anyway for your good deeds. AKA KARMA! Guild Wars has it. Reddit has it. The world needs it!

Now you’re probably thinking, “WTF is this long degenerate post. What’s your strategy, retard?” Well yeah, I’m still trying to buy GME to help the government fix the system, equalize “wealth” in the best way possible, help the poor, etc, etc.

This is not investment advice. I’m not a financial advisor. I promise to tattoo WSB on my ass if I make it out of this.

It doesn't take a lot and I'm sure a lot of you are already leveraged to your tits. Pay day was yesterday for some of you.

Create a fidelity account right now and start that transfer.

If you can afford it buy shares and calls. The shares dry up the supply for shorts, and then you can lend these out on fidelity, collect interest and recall them back to really fuck with them. The calls contribute to MM buying up shares to cover their position which causes gamma squeezing to push the price up further. Normally I wouldn't condone FD weeklies (unless the cocaine was really good that week) but they actually work pretty well for GME right now.

The price is high and so are the stakes but I've never been more erect in my life with my family - you god damn degenerates.

Well, on the surface it doesn't seem to be a problem. Realistically however these posts are 99% of the time pure spam and break WSB rules, endangering the sub. Congrats, you are new, thats great! But that does not mean than you can:

1. Shill tickers to p&d. Not only does this break community rules it is ILLEGAL
2. Ask retardedly basic questions. We will make fun of you.
3. Ask people to donate to your GoFundMe. I will reply with the link https://gofuck.yourself

These kinds of posts are crippling our sub, and the members can only report so many of them. At this time, when the media is focused on us some of these could endanger our standing on Reddit.

No, their biggest actual enemy is Russia BY FAR. Cold War, using other countries to conduct proxy wars, constant hacking from Russia, Putin controlling Trump and making him his puppet???? Wtf is that shit

ROBINHOOD BLOCKING WITHDRAWALS IS WORSE THAN LIMITING SHARES,27,l8r6hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8r6hv/robinhood_blocking_withdrawals_is_worse_than/,3,1612057840.0,"First off: I'm 100% cash, no margin, no PDT, no pending deposits.

Since early yesterday, I (and many others) are finding that we cannot withdraw funds from Robinhood. Just simply not showing up as available to withdraw. My guess is they're going to say it's a clearing house issue and that they cannot release the funds until all of the trades over the last few days process. Same weak ass excuse they made for halting/limiting buying in the first place.

But think about it: This is even worse than halting/limiting buying. This is literally holding hundreds of millions of dollars hostage, a big chunk of which would otherwise be moved to competitor's brokerages and used to purchase GME. Intentionally or not, it's simultaneously anticompetitive to other brokers, STILL helps the very same people who took these short positions, and further limits the ability of the retail investor to participate in the free market.

When they cut our ability to buy, the entire internet erupted. The same thing should be happening right now, at a deafening level, when hundreds of millions of dollars of retail investor money is being held hostage.

Why $GME is the Great Wealth Reset,36,l8r55y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8r55y/why_gme_is_the_great_wealth_reset/,25,1612057747.0,"Edit: I talk more about it on my live chat on the subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/thenextwallstreetbets/

$GME can be considered the next Great Reset for Classism. Hedge fund managers and elites are legitimately afraid after we've uncovered the power of our massive group. 

Trading was always considered something you'd do in secret. You like a stock, you buy it and pray that it goes up so you make a profit.

When WSB became the base of all talks for stock trading, people realised that as a group, they could all give each advice on what stocks would provide best gains over long term due to their product being good. 

Now that once dying Gamestop has been risen from the dead,as well as $AMC, people are waking up to the fact that we can control the market just as well as the Wall street guys, if not better, simply because of our voice.

That's why they are crying for regulation, and inspections on the forum as well as getting it deleted, because they realise that the game has been switched. We've flipped the script on them and become as powerful.

Anyway, enough ranting. $GME and $AMC to the moon!!",2021-01-31 03:49:07

Seems that savvy retail investors identifying a bullish momentum trade in GME turned short squeeze began poking into a broader situation taking place already.

Wall Street and bankers see fintech start ups as a huge threat to their business model. Likewise, c0in technology has the ability to disrupt the use of the U.S. dollar (which we all know will happen), which the government does not like. 

Voila!!!! Wall st/Government have common interest and want to help each other. Tactically the government needs Wall st to fund them to give to Main Street to keep trust in the system. Strategically, the government helps Wall St defeat the fin tech threat.

This real GME squeeze looks like a hefty attack against Wall st. Looks like this threat could be repeated in other areas of the market. Let’s see how Wall st/government respond to eliminate this from happening (laws, regulations, etc.)

May want to keep an I on how this unfolds because it will likely effect what/who to get tendies from in the future

I had source but they mention the c0in and can’t be included. Just look up Janet Yellen, Jamie Dimon, Jerome Powell. And Winklevoss twins, chamath, musk, and others in relation to these topics.",2021-01-31 03:18:32

Off topic I know, but it's 1/8th the valuation of CHWY with very similar market shares (approx. 5-6%) and revenues ($4B-$5B range) as of the end of 2020. Chewy is definitely growing faster rn no doubt. However, the WOOF CEO started in 2018 and came from HPQ. HPQ and its stock performed very well while he was el presidente; it actually seems to be dropping quite a bit ever since he left. He was definitely blindsided by the pandemic in orchestrating the turnaround. Long term debt is the elephant in the room, but the IPO will cover a portion of it, and the turnaround will take care of the rest.  I like the omnichannel focus, the brick and mortar footprint (bc of vet services) coming out of the pandemic, and a tech oriented CEO. If they can make big inroads with marketing and customer service, they will be on equal footing with CHWY. Lots of other factors of course, but I like the stock and the opportunity for a turnaround given the $97B TAM.

Wish there were 2022/23 leaps available. Only goes out to September rn. Anyway, I'll be buying deep ITM September calls and a sizable shares position.",2021-01-31 02:55:29

So this sub has blown up to 6.9m (nice) subscribers. There are currently ~47m floating shares for GME right now. I don't know how many of those are being held since the last update, but theoretically if everyone bought just one share like RH allows, we could drop the float by 6.9m in a single day. THATS A -20% CHANGE IN FLOATING SHARES. This would severely pinch any shorts as supply would tighten. If we wanted to decimate the float, each person would need to buy ~ 6.5 shares. 

That doesn't seem like too much if everyone actually bought, and I'd imagine that a tighter float could possibly initiate a squeeze bc hedgies would panic cover. But once again, just a theoretical take on supply/demand of shares outstanding. Not advice. 

Do you agree or disagree? Would tightened float supply cause a chain reaction resulting in a squeeze faster than anticipated? I'm curious.

Ok..You're now a part of the movement and we welcome it but this needs to be said. 


We do not hide the fact that WSB is a Casino and you take on your own risk when you put your $$$ into the pot. 

We've seen some insane media posts this past week comparing us to alt-right, incels, Nazis... You name it, there's a reporter from Big Media out there trying to label us with some bullshit narrative. 

GME will eventually peak and there will be WSBers holding the bag at the end. Some will lose thousands. Some may lose millions and possibly their entire life savings holding that bag. 

They will blame everyone who sold before they did and why they got left holding the bag. 

Expect a ton of ""I LOST EVERYTHING"" with a lot of finger pointing towards WSB. Expect the media to blame us for ""encouraging"" this behavior..

So I'm going to make this loud and clear for everyone thinking of cashing out their entire 401k and putting everything into GME. For the Media reading and everyone else. 

**WSB IS A CASINO.**

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.


Sorry for my bad English.


Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.

I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)


So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.


Backstory:


I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.


So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.


So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.


In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.


Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.


But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.


Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.



The Beer Virus Crash:


I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.


The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.


Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".


After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..


Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. 


And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them


You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.


GME and the global movement:


And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.


So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.


A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.


I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.


So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** 🚀🚀✅

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$6 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** 💸💸💸

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares.

Source: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional)

Collectively, **they literally own 21.10% of GME**. They are INVESTED in its success.

Consider putting your volume, our customer base, behind them. They are with retailers.

# **Okay, so what do I fucking do now?**

Open a new account in either of these brokerages. Deposit your money and buy GME! Fidelity gives you INSTANT funds as margin. 

# **LEAVE YOUR SHARES IN RH. TRANSFER YOUR MONEY OUT.** 

I know, this sounds fucking stupid. But your shares are needed in play next week. LEAVING THEM IN RH FOR NOW! HOLD DIAMOND-HAND IT 💎👋

Transferring your assets (shares, options) takes [5-14 days with Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/transfer-assets), and [similarly at Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/contact-us/faqs/what-investment).

# again: **LEAVE YOUR SHARES IN RH. TRANSFER YOUR MONEY OUT.** 

Do NOT transfer your shares from RH yet!! Just your money.

Here is how to **open a new brokerage account**:

First of all, why is he so vested in telling people to sell?  Why are the retail brokerages so vested in just letting people sell, but only letting them buy 0 or 1 shares of GME?

GME was trading at $338 when he said that.

A home run = 1; grand slam = 4.

If it was a home run now, then grand slam = 4 * 338 = $1,352.

My personal price target is at least $1,352 for GME or higher. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This is not investment advice and I am not an investment professional. I am just a regular retard.

What I am personally doing is not only holding, but locking 🔐the shares up in a box 📦 and throwing away the key as a longterm hold.

I am a worker bee in the hive, and you Wall Street suits are the queen bees. I won't get any adulation, recognition, respect, or dignity from anyone likely ever. None of you may care about this story, but I'm going to tell it anyways.

I grew up in a relatively poor rural area that had already felt the effects of Wall Street's grip over Main Street. Many small businesses shutting down, no real good jobs available, no real way to move up in society in Small Town, USA. I, like many Americans was taught that education was important and I could just get a good job and that it would provide me enough comfort to live a good life. That was a lie.

I've had a long struggle in life with bouts of depression, self-doubt, etc. but one thing has been there no matter what. Video games.

What did I do:  
* During the 2008 financial crisis? I played video games.
* When gas was nearly $5 a gallon? I played video games.
* When everything went haywire after 2016? I played video games.
* When COVID hit? I played video games.

I began investing in GME since 2018 on and off because I would exit the position sometimes when bad news hit, but I always liked the stock. Now, I didn't have some grand plan to short squeeze or know financials well enough to know this company was way more valuable like u/DeepFuckingValue or u/Uberkikz11. I just like video games and I LIKE THE STOCK. Why do I like the stock? Because they sell video games, and whenever I feel down I go down to good old GameStop and maybe pick up a game that's on sale as a pick-me-up. That's the one thing that's been a constant in an ever-evolving landscape that is modern society.

I sold GME during its early rally over $100.(Paper hands I know) I had been trimming along the way because as someone who has yet to see five figures at a time on the screen, for me, my ape brain was scared to lose it.

So I don't care how much it cost that I bought 5 shares of GME Friday. If I lose 75% of my investment, so what. I'm giving back to a company that was always there for me no matter what. GameStop never let me down. That's why the more you billionaires I see crying about what is supposed to be a free market, the better.

GME is actually criminally undervalued and is poised to be the next trillion dollar company.,2,l8tmms,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tmms/gme_is_actually_criminally_undervalued_and_is/,2,1612064094.0,"Mods: Please don’t delete, hear me out

TLDR: GameStop’s long-term success is not a meme. They are actually poised to be the next trillion-dollar company. They are still highly undervalued despite the risk. 

Long Rant: I am not a financial advisor. I’m just a simple ape that wants a better future for us all.

I started investing in my early 20’s back in 2011. I’ve actually avoided wallstreetbets for a long time because YOLO and loss porn were never my cup of tea. But somewhere along the way you all grew up. You found out the difference between gambling and investing. You see, I’ve always been of the opinion that any type of short-term strategy is gambling when it comes to buying or selling stock. Markets are susceptible to wild fluctuation and you are a fool if you think you can time the market for a perfect quick flip. I’ve avoided options and have never taken a short position because I understand just how risky they can be, exposing yourself to potentially unlimited losses is something only the stupidest people are willing to do and they do not deserve to call themselves investors. To be an investor there is only one true strategy and that is buy and HOLD!!!!!!

I remember back in 2012 I read an article about a little-known company at the time called Tesla Motors. They had just announced their model S and I really liked that company. So I bought some shares which at the time cost my $27 each. I held those shares and I waited until model S deliveries started arriving on doorsteps. I waited until charging stations cropped up all over the country. I waited until they announced gigafactories and energy storage. And in 2015 I sold my shares for about $270 per share. I remember bragging about my gains at the time like a paper handed little bitch. 

I don’t brag about that anymore. If I would have held on to those shares my life would be in a completely different place now financially. This was one of the hardest lessons I’ve ever learned as an investor and I don’t intend on making it again.

Enough about me, let me tell you why GME is the next trillion-dollar company and why I’m holding my measly 15 shares at $298 until I pass them down to my daughter in my will.

First, let me talk about the power of a brand by looking at a company like Apple. In 2001 Apple was also at an all time low. Considered to be a failing company at the time they released a new mp3 layer called the ipod which gained them tremendous appeal amongst a younger generation of customers. Since then Apple has spent billions of dollars per year in marketing and product placements to maintain mass appeal for their brand among young people which are the most difficult demographic to market to. Apple today is worth $2 trillion dollars as a company. And you know what?!

I don’t like Apple. They make overpriced hardware and with overly restrictive software and use subliminal brainwashing tactics to trick you into buying their crappy products.

But Gamestop? I really like Gamestop, here’s why.

Gamestop, much like Apple in 2001 doesn’t look like much on paper, but none of that matters. Because, without spending a single dollar, overnight, GME has become the most beloved brand among younger people. That is incredibly powerful. Never before have so many individuals been this enthusiastically invested in the long-term success of any company.

GameStop has gotten massive amounts of free PR and had undying loyalty from millions of individuals that are not only investors, but customers as well. This whole movement is being driven by GameStop’s loyal customer base. This is monumental!!!

If I were GameStop’s CEO I would be so giddy right now. Their company has been adopted by the wsb community. It is our child. I would never sell my child. There is no price high enough to sacrifice my own children. GameStop is poised for a very bright future because there isn’t a single new product or pivot that this loyal, undying customer and investor base won’t be on board with. New streaming service? Esports league? Eggs? I don’t care, I’m buying it.

I keep hearing all this bullshit from boomers who think they are experts, and they keep saying GameStop isn’t worth their current price. This is Bullshit! They are lying to put fear into you. GameStop is actually worth so much more! $1,000 per share is not a meme, $10,000 per share is not a meme. In twenty years GameStop will be worth more than Apple, Google, and Amazon combined. Why? Because it is OUR company, not their company. We just bought it, it’s ours and we will make sure it is the best one!

Do not be a paper handed fool that falls for all the bullshit fear from media sources and idiots who are in the pockets of hedge funds and short term gamblers. That’s all they are. Morons who would’ve bet against Apple in 2001. 

Diamond hands is not a meme either. It is the simplest and most legitimate form of investing. Buying a stock that you like and holding it until you retire is exactly how you become a millionaire. It’s a strategy that’s good enough for Warren Buffet and it’s good enough for us. Think of all the paper handed pussies that sold Apple in 2001. Is that what you want this to be? The time you made a small buck quickly and missed out on true long-term wealth?

As far as I’m concerned there is only one thing that GME can do to mess this up. And that is to turn against us. Don’t dilute shares, don’t bail out the short sellers that were so eager to shutter your doors and ruin your business. We believe in you and will support you so don’t let us down.

As long as GameStop is loyal to us, the investors. Their future is very bright. Any industry or pivot they would like to pursue is immediately theirs because they have our undying support.

Amazon, Google, Apple… I don’t like them. But GameStop? I really really like them a lot. I don’t want a Gmail any more, let me get a GameStop mail. I don’t want prime any more, I want GameStop! I don’t want an iPhone, I want GameStop!

We need to get gamestops attention,12,l8tlwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tlwo/we_need_to_get_gamestops_attention/,2,1612064040.0,"--------------MAKE GAMESTOP GREAT AGAIN----------

Yes I'm well aware we likely have their attention as it is. But I mean from a shareholders perspective. The market is looking at us like we're driving the price through the roof plain and simply to dump it later when all is said and done. BUT if we can convince gamestop to use this new found fortune of theirs and do some serious rebranding and expansion, we could make a true argument for the value of the stock. We are not investing for what the company is CURRENTLY worth, we are investing for what the company can be worth. That has always been the idea of the market from the beginning. Invest in them to take your money and do great things with it.

I remember as a kid going to midnight releases with hundreds up people to wait for the new edition of halo, or world of warcraft expansion. Gamestop created communities in the day, introduced friendships. And I want to see them give me that sense of connection to the world again.

My immediate thoughts would be e-sports, they could be the fanduel or draftkings of the gaming world. Host competitions for league of legends, cs:go, fortnite, whatever. 
Obviously the run-up with the chewy co-founder has brought them into E-commerce has helped but we need something huge for gamestop to really capitalize on, with that set in place there would literally be no way to fail (even more so than we can't fail already) but with THIS it would also be justifiable in the case that the law comes down upon us

Everyone in debt is short on the Dollar. 2008 was a short squeeze for the Dollar itself.,7,l8tls9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tls9/everyone_in_debt_is_short_on_the_dollar_2008_was/,0,1612064030.0,"Just realzied that this why the federal reserve is so afriad of deflation. When the dollar increases in value it squeezes everyone that is short on the dollar aka people in debt. The US itself has a short position in the dollar of  **27.8 Trillion Dollars.** This is known as the  US national Debt.

What we saw in February 2020 before Jpow turned on the printer was the start of a short squeeze on the US Dollar. If 100% of the american people stop spending becuase they are buying Gamestop instead, the economy grinds to a halt and the squeeze on the US Dollar happens again. You can already see that SPY has been dropping since Gamestop starting mooning. Get ready boys, the dollar is getting squeezed again. This is why regulators and billionaires are panicing. you guys are making SPY go down. You guys are creating a bigger short squeeze than just gamestop, the dollar is getting squeezed too.

Stop thinking you can accomplish short squeezes on other stocks,149,l8t6zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t6zj/stop_thinking_you_can_accomplish_short_squeezes/,143,1612062963.0,"Every other post is ""ShOrT SqUeEzE"" on AMC NOK BB etc. I even saw a post on a short squeeze on Silver and Gold.

This is getting ridiculous. You all are posting or trying to rush to the next company to try to get in cheap because you believed you missed out on the GME short squeeze, WHEN THE GME SQUEEZE HASN'T EVEN OCCURRED YET. All your posts about AMC and NOK are lazy and the only theory you have as to why the price for these companies are going up is because you can squeeze the shorts on these companies and beat the hedge funds. Lots of people have already lost money on these stocks on Thursday.

FLASHBACK to several months before GME exploded and this sub gained millions of new followers, there was a fundamental bull thesis for GME as a company and their future prospects. That's why many of us, including myself, got in early when the price was between $10-$20. GME was not going bankrupt despite the narrative behind it. They had cash on hand to pay down debt. They are going to crush their Q4 earnings because of console sales and historically have done very well during game console releases. They have revenue sharing agreements with Microsoft. They are opening gaming centers. Their 1000+ retail locations can be transformed to distribution centers. Their ecommerce is rapidly growing every year. Ryan Cohen and the new board members are yelling at the boomers running GME and telling them what they need to do in this new era of gaming and digital.

The short interest + squeeze on GME is CHERRY ON TOP. And the timing of catalysts because of console release, Q4 earnings, and digital sales because of the pandemic puts GME owners in a unique spot to capitalize on the shitty positions shorters find themselves now to be squeezed.

TLDR: Before you blindly throw your money at AMC and NOK because of ""short squeeze"" think about whether or not there are going to be any catalysts and bull cases as to why the stock price should be going up to potentially trigger a squeeze or else you'll be left holding major bags.

Know who’s on the other side of your trade,42,l8t3d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3d4/know_whos_on_the_other_side_of_your_trade/,30,1612062700.0,"I find the following to be very interesting:

First: let me confess that I sold a percentage of my shares but let me tell you why. 

I bought in at $40, sold, and bought back in at $97 and again at $140. Thursday afternoon, my girlfriend comes home from work and tells me that after three years of trying, she’s pregnant. I’m going to be a dad!

I’m absolutely shook with excitement and the rest of the day was us just talking about it. Bedtime comes around and I’m laying awake, thinking, diapers are fucking expensive and 3k buys a lot of diapers. I need my original investment back. But what is my plan?

I set a sell order at 409.97 for 8 shares. The amount of my original investment. I pick that number because, well, it’s not 420.69 and I know there are a ton of retards with sell orders at that price. I needed something well below that and 8 shares at 409.97 just happened to coincide perfectly with my original investment. 

The next morning, I wake up to a massive spike pre-market and I know, I got a chance. The market opens and for the first minute, the stock shot up and at 9:31 EST, my sell order for 8 shares at 409.97 was completed. I had back my original investment and everything going forward is now a free ride. The stock briefly touches 413.00 and you can look at the charts to know what happened next. 


**This morning** I’m reading a post here on WSB and I see a post from a guy saying that he bought at 409 and I’m thinking “the stock has only touched that price 4 times, what if...”

I read a few of his posts and learn that he bought 8 shares at 409, so I asked him if he bought them at at 9:31 EST and he replied in the affirmative. I asked him “was the price actually 409.97?” And again. Affirmative. I realize that yes, this is most likely the other side of my trade. A fucking retard, just like me. 


What does this mean? It means that Melvin Capital is likely NOT buying our shares at 409, that much I can gather, but what else could it tell us? The odds of finding the other side of my trade on WSB are probably astronomical, considering how many shares were traded that day, so I’m blown away by that possibility, but I’d love some smart people to weigh in on the odds of that occurrence, and what else it might possibly tell us. 

(You can check my post history to see the interaction. I may provide further proof if anyone is interested)

Increasingly we've been seeing posts and comments from Redditors who have purchased GME and similar shorted positions with a primary interest in exacting revenge against the billionaire hedge funds.  That’s all good and fine.  I totally resonate with that message and honestly, fuck ‘em.  They set the rules in their favour and are now upset that we’ve found a way to exploit it.  

THAT SAID, I’ve also seen people taking incredible financial risks and self-destructive behaviour in the interest of “sticking it to the man”.  We may be retarded but don’t be fucking stupid.  At the end of the day, these big fish are gonna lose a couple billion that they manage for others, cry a little, and then go home to their mansions, yachts, jets, mail-order brides and their boyfriends, etc.  If anything they’ll go to Congress and set the rules even more squarely in their favour.

Wanna know how we can exact revenge against the system?  Learn it.  Use it.  Get rich yourself.  Then if you so wish, change the system however you please.  Don’t go broke for this.  I guarantee you, we’re annoying as fuck to them, but at the end of the day, they’re still going to be better off than any of us.

GameStop: Why this time is different- Open letter to WallStreet and CNBC,22789,l8oig7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8oig7/gamestop_why_this_time_is_different_open_letter/,1607,1612051017.0,"
Dear WallStreet and CNBC,

You have been calling this a speculative bubble, that GameStop will ultimately crash down to earth, and that the “little guys” are going to get hurt. Jim Cramer wants us to “take your home run” and sell. You use words like “fundamentals” and “valuations” and says that the stock price is not justified. 

Here’s the fundamental:
I am an ER doctor that trained in inner city Detroit. When I was a resident physician, Obama was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly African-Americans in the city did not improve. Despite Obamacare, I saw little improvement in the health outcomes of the patients I worked with. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and gang violence. YOU have left these people behind.

I spent the last several years working in a small town in the Midwest, when Trump was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly white Americans also did not improve, and have in fact worsened. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and suicides. These patients I care for are also people whom YOU have left behind. 

With the pandemic, I have seen those who are already at the brink of financial solvency lose their jobs and I see lines outside food banks. I see the health outcomes of my patients decline as they forego preventive care. I, on the other hand, kept my job, got a raise, and saw the value of my 401k rise as the economy crashed around me. Going to work every day is a constant and stark reminder of the brokenness and disparity of the economic system and my sheer powerlessness to change it. I realize now that it is not political. It is YOU.

I own GameStop because represents something to me. It is the very embodiment of the millennial generation that you have left behind- a down-and-out aging retailer that you feel is no longer worth investing in. We ARE GameStop. We are not selling because we believe in ourselves and investing in ourselves. We WANT to see it succeed.

I am fully aware that I have benefited from having a 401k and it is what is supporting your industry. But this also means that YOU work for ME. I fully expect you to fuck over my generation to save yourselves by running to the politicians and regulators that you have bought to stop the squeeze and get them to suspend trading on $GME. It is not lost on us that the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that you paid Janet Yellen $800,000 in speaking fees. You will tell them that this is a “systemic risk” and that this will “crash the entire financial system”. You will remind them what happened after they let Lehman Brothers fail in 2008. Don’t.

If you are a politician or a regulator reading this, don’t listen to their bullshit. If you intervene, stop trading of $GME, bail out hedge funds and big banks like you have in the past and try to placate us by dragging a few hedge fund managers in front of a congressional hearing, you’ll unite the entire country against YOU. Make sure you are on the right side of this. You work for US too.
 
This country is broken and fractured. You have goaded us into tearing each other apart for years. This is the first time that I have seen the entire country rally behind a single cause. You have given us a reason to unite- against you and the system you have built and upheld. 

I own GameStop not because Diamond Hands. I own GameStop because I AM GameStop. I am choosing to invest in my generation, and selling would be selling myself out.",2021-01-31 01:56:57

“Hold”
“To the Moon”
“Fuck Melvin!”

And all the 🚀 🚀 I could find.

I thought... “this is great! I’ll make some money, pay off my credit cards, maybe surprise my wife with something, and if it goes *really well* I can tell my wife she can stay home with our two young boys without having to worry about work”.

One can dream.

But now here we are.. day whatever.

...and guess what?!

THURSDAY happened. *The day we all got screwed. *Not just Robinhood accounts blocking specific transactions aimed at tanking specific stocks, but TD Ameritrade; ETrade, and likely many others. 

We all knew the risks when investing - but we all assumed we were all living and taking our risk within a defined and unchanging set of rules.

On Thursday we saw an abuse of power. I only lost $2500.. I wonder how many people lost so much more.. but when I got out I *hoped* WSB sentiment would be “hold *if you can lose it all* but please take out your profits now *if what you make today will make anything in your life better* - because a lot of people are betting with money they truly can’t afford to lose.

The only thing was that Friday was the next day - and there was one good reason to wait for Friday.

**FRIDAY WAS WHEN WE LOST.**

Gamma squeeze. If we could hold $200 share price - there should have been a surge in price increase due to the insane amount of ITM options that were exporting that day. Share price was over $200 for most of the day - and finished *well above* $200.

So what happened? **nothing**. The hedge funds continued to manipulate the market not only with insanely unfair algo trading, but by continuing to influence brokers to fuck everybody from trading how they wanted to.

**You have to get that.**

-	Manipulating the brokers.
-	Taking out *more* shorts even over 100%
-	Calling on buddies to tap into more $billions to fund it all.

The gamma squeeze did not happen because those puppet masters are able to control the market, and they can maneuver better than you can, and they have endless access to capital - plain and simple.

They are going to take out MORE shorts when it’s at $400 and pay them down when it’s at $300, or $150, or whatever.  **They will slowly bleed you dry.**

They (hedge funds) can ride that wave over and over - with more speed and sophistication than you guys will currently allow yourselves to believe and again - not everybody can afford to lose without serious consequences.

All this to say I’m tired. I’m tired of putting in *most* of my energy and all of my day towards this. I’m **ashamed** that you people are telling those with stories of pulling profits and buying stuff for loved ones or paying off debts is a bad move because they “need to hold”. Seeing stuff like that makes me start drawing correlations with extremists - blurring the lines of support and delusion.

I’m gonna go back to enjoying my time with family and next week will be back to my normal routine of finding a stock to day trade and pouring profits into long term investments that aren’t so absolutely bat shit insane. 

**TL/DR: ** This “movement” went from good, to great, to exciting as hell, to all consuming, to insane, to denial en masse, and now delusion is rearing its ugly head - so I’m out.

Good luck to all who are still holding positions. I hope you all get out without injury.",2021-01-31 00:26:59

Yes, while your wife and her boyfriend plan on what they’re  going to do with your portion of the wealth redistribution that is GME. 

While you’re laughing with your wife’s boyfriend at all the memes, and generally having a good relaxing weekend, while realizing that Monday’s don’t seem so bad anymore. 

These hedge fund bastards aren’t resting. They’re fucking panicking. They aren’t sleeping well, and any drinks they have are to steady their nerves. They’re talking to their lawyers, their wives are looking for boyfriends, and the constant reminder that they’re still over 100% short looms over their heads like a guillotine in the French Revolution. 

We’re coming, and while we enjoy life the way it always has been for us they are worried they may have to live less like kings. They’re worried about losing their money, and some of them their freedom. 

They are calling, planning, plotting, trying to find a way to avoid holding the bags after this shit goes nuclear. But the bottom line is they fucked up, and we found it. 

We’ve already changed the way the finance game works for these hedge fund fucks. We know now that some brokers are using us and our info to give these fucks yet another advantage over us, and we’ve exposed how frail this system is. Not just because it’s poorly built, but because regulations aren’t actually sound and when they are they aren’t enforced. 

Enjoy your weekend. You’ve earned it after the roller coaster that was GME, and any of the other meme stocks. Just know that even after this thing goes parabolic the fight isn’t over. 

They will fight. They will try to “protect” you from yourself. We must not let them. We must use our winnings to stand and shout. We must use the internet, which these dumbasses don’t actually understand, to amplify our voices and be heard globally as we scream that we won’t settle for less than a truly Free Market.

A market where I can yolo my Wendy’s paycheck in hopes to buy my wife a new car so that maybe she will have sex with me instead of her boyfriend. A market where stonks only go up. A market where the autist isn’t fucked by gay bears but instead grabs two fistfuls of fur and gives that gay bear the best dicking he’s ever gotten before.

""Stimulus"" is really emergency aid to avoid rioting. There are NO SIGNS of inflation, let alone reflation happening anytime soon in the US.

For the prices they are selling PUTS and CALLS at the 325 strike price (expiring 5th Feb) upper bound is roughly $575 and the lower $75 ( Purple line) . This is the full straddle price the MM is getting for the options they are selling. Once price goes over this level they start to lose money. 

**They are not expecting price to go above or below these levels otherwise they would have made the options more expensive.**

Usually the MMs try not to hedge as its expensive and is cheaper for them to defend those levels  and /or will rely on the gamma scalpers to start shorting the stock at the call line or the top boundary purple line. Traders who have bought the 325 Calls will have a lot of value in those options and can short the stock risk free if they still have time value left on the option.

However if the MMs think that the levels wont be shorted and there is too much long value in the stock they will buy to hedge themselves.

This however is not a normal market at the moment.

Anyway some levels to watch next week to see if they try defend.

You still have one mountain to climb, however.

YOUR USER INTERFACE IS EMBARRASSINGLY TERRIBLE. I am well aware of the time, effort, energy, and capital you’ve spent building your app and website over the years, and that’s great. However, RobinHood has walked the fucking dog on you when it comes to simplicity, ease of use, and approachability. They’ve brought millions of new investors to the market, and have had world changing successes of which I’m sure you’re all well aware of (you know, like when they changed the game my forcing you to make trades free?).

I’m a Gen X Millennial, and although I may be able to adapt to your convoluted-ass website and mobile app, a lot of the future investors will not have the patience or inclination to do the same. *You have to change it, and do it quickly.* It needs to be sleek, modern, and user-friendly. You don’t have to copy RobinHood (hell, why would you want to?), but you do have to come up with something that can keep the influx of new customers from jumping ship once their aboard, and **I’m not talking about making it hard for us to leave, you have to make it easy for us to stay.**

The last week’s debacle is as best an opportunity as you’ll ever have to catapult yourself into the front of your industry. It’s the World Series, bottom of the 9th, the bases are loaded, and you’re down by 3. RobinHood is pitching with a broken arm, and you are the batter with the .989 average.

What can be done?
Call up your broker and ask them to not lend out any of your shares. 

  ""not allow any lending of any of my stocks or funds.""   They honored that immediately and are mailing a letter stating such. 1-3 business days for delivery. I couldn't be happier with Fidelity.

**In this DD I will highlight how the short float % has been increasing over time in BB.**   


[Short float &#37; - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/sclkg9ivshe61.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae126d58d0126fd86b28f80ce22eb5f81f4b358f)

As can be seen in this picture, the short float % has been steadily increased over time as the price continues to go up. This could indicate that the shorts have been losing a ton of money, and is now trying to double down. However, this is nowhere near GME or AMC levels but could increase a lot more over time as seen in how much the short volume has increased these last couple of days. 

&#x200B;

[Short volume interest - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/p7urdnrjuhe61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c6f6397db19891afddf34baff974d7269385c9)

As seen in this picture you can clearly see that the short volume has been increasing over time, and will most likely have an effect on how much the short float % currently is. Since the latest data for the short float % is from the 15th of January, we would have to wait for the 9th of February to see newly updated data on the short float %. 

  
The question is now, will they keep shorting BB into oblivion as they did with GME and AMC?   


**It's also important to look at the options flow and the possibility of a gamma squeeze.**  

[Graph from: u\/Strig1 ](https://preview.redd.it/dkcek800whe61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9388763aca6f8fa1109d460f6831034d107242b)

This week we saw something that very well could have been manipulation of the price based upon how many calls that would expire ITM of the price was above $30. They kept the price under $15 to let all these contracts expire OTM. But how does the options table looks like next week? See picture below

As seen in this picture there are far fewer calls OTM next week compared to this week. So I would think that the stock price has a better chance of moving higher this week. However the possibility of a Gamma squeeze next week is small but if the price can get above $25 there is a chance to see a push upwards due to call sellers buying back shares to cover.

I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, ""you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?"" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. 

I just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, ""he's just trying to make a living"". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.

 
You know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. 


This is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. 

To be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street.

I have not participated in a more meaningful movement in my entire life. It is not The Law, it is Their Law. And in the words of The Prodigy: Fuck 'em, and their law. We followed their rules, then they changed the rules at the last minute to protect themselves.

The system has always been rigged. The only path to change was from within, and we found the key. **Those in power have chosen this as the only solution, it will be their undoing.** They will burn it down themselves, before we do, out of spite for us, to prevent us from taking more than the stale crumbs. We need to take it all away from them before that.

Our next moves are important. We continue the GME squeeze to completion. We proceed to squeeze the other over-shorted stocks. This hunt will be limited from now on in effectiveness now that they are aware and had a market manipulation event in their favor to minimize exposure. Also note the stocks that were gems but heavily shorted so 'tutes could take all the cheap shares for themselves (BB/NOK/PLTR). We now have to contend with their counter-moves. I am anticipating a tree-shake to rout out weak retail so they can lessen our forces. Regulations talks will probably be the catalyst.

We need to think in terms of countering their moves, not following common ""wisdom"". I have a feeling derivatives will be our key here, they offer the leverage and domino effect we can capitalize on. There will be a move away from standard assets as confidence in the old market disintegrates. We will see more crypo and precious metals plays. I am unfamiliar enough with forex/futures to predict their roles, but I welcome ideas.

We have pressed them into playing their entire hand, they will now make desperate moves that we can counter since they cannot afford the time to apply their boomer-scam-tactics as effectively as in the past.

How Wall Street may try to take GME tendeis from retail investors and how retail investors can protect themselves,256,l8ow40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8ow40/how_wall_street_may_try_to_take_gme_tendeis_from/,103,1612051987.0," Ok so before you incinerate me, I want to make things clear, I have been holding since $20 level. I sold part of my position as I want to buy a house and that money definitely helps (at the end of the day we want money for these kind of things). I am still holding shares though because I like the stock.

Now that everything is clear, I just want to highlight potential ways Wall Street may use to take away your tendies if you are a GME investor and how you can protect yourself. This is my opinion based on what I observe and nothing else:

#  Potential price supression by hedge funds

Thursday and Friday volume (purple circle) was really low in contrast to previous days (Monday to Wednesday) when the squeeze started (green circle). This means two things:

1. Everybody held the line. Short Squeeze has not even started.
2. What happened on Thursday and Friday seems to be blatant market manipulation to supress the price without the participation of retail investors. Obviously I can not prove this, but volume is the smoking gun. There are also some other posts in wsb that show how short sellers are selling longs to cover shorts (maybe that is why the rest of the market has been red the last two days?)

&#x200B;

[GME hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/t8cyoo6iuhe61.png?width=1721&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09cfffc3a89f119a34f6988a01410b9c69fa44d)

 

So hedge funds could try to keep the price supressed for weeks or months by restricting retail participation. This is how they ~~ban~~ discourage people from buying and encourage selling.

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: if you want to invest consider buying the stock or if you prefer call options, spread them between different maturities. The worst thing that can happen is that you buy weeklies OTM and they expire worthless, this is how they drain your capital and outlast retail investors. If your broker does not allow you to buy, open an account into another broker.

# Mainstream Media Misinformation

We have seen CNBC manipulating what is happening and trying to spread the narrative that retail investors don't know what to do. They are trying to push the narrative that retail traders don't know what to do and it smells to me like Wall Street is going to ask to shut down forums like this one and limit access to leverage products such as options.

You can find a great interview with Chamath where he literally destroy the CNBC reporter on YouTube (just type ""Chamath GME, AMC"" and you will find it).

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: be careful with posting loss porn from GME options, after Thursday price manipulation where lots of people that bought ATM and OTM options ~~were robbed by hedge funds while retail investors could not participate in the market~~ lost money, they may use these posts on TV and twist them like ""*they lose money because they gamble and they do not know what they are doing therefore it is necessary some regulation in place to limit access to leverage products as they can not take care of themselves*""

# RobinHood or other brokerage services potential bankruptcies

I posted about this yesterday but inmediately deleted the post due to panic it caused (it was not my intention, sorry).

RobinHood funds are covered by FDIC which means your money is safe in the event of bankruptcy, but what I am not so sure (maybe someone can clarify) is, in the event of bankruptcy what would happen to your portfolio.

Aparently RobinHood liquidated some positions for different users without their consent (you can find posts in wsb related to that), so maybe they can liquidate your holdings at market price, give you the money and that's all (this is just pure speculation from mi side). Now, if they do this while retail traders are not allowed to participate, hedge funds could buy your shares at whatever price they want and cover their shorts. Given that Citadel is their main client I would not rule out this possibility.

I know this is too much speculation but could be a potential scenario given what happened on Thursday may have happened because the GME trade caused a systemic risk in the whole US financial markets due to leverage on hedge funds that went short (people have also written other posts about this in wsb).

Under this scenario RobinHood would be sacrified. Short Sellers would cover at the price they moreless want and any potential amount you have on your account not covered by RobinHood would be covered by FDIC (aka the american tax payer... sounds familiar, maybe like 2008 again?)

There is a video on YouTube about this topic in the Meet Kevin channel (seems the guy is quite popular in US).

**HOW YOU PROTECT YOURSELF**: I don't know what you can do in this scenario. Just hold your shares because if you want to transfer them to another broker maybe they also liquidate your positions (not sure about this, if anyone can confirm please, that would be great). Obviously, once GME squeeze is over, get out of RobinHood. If you want to buy GME, you can do it from other brokers.

**TLDR**: If you invested in GME. HOLD. DONT PANIC SELL. NEVER.

Nothing has changed, the short squeeze has not even started.

Be careful with weeklies, this could last weeks or months, better buy the stonk or spread across different maturities.

Get out of RobinHood once the GME short squeeze is over.

"Market analysis of why $GME literally can’t go tits up, and why no one will get left behind because the price won’t fall",1740,l8osi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8osi7/market_analysis_of_why_gme_literally_cant_go_tits/,449,1612051720.0,"Firstly, get the fuck off Robinhood and make a fidelity account. It took 10 minutes and a couple hours to transfer money. 

Strap in you 💎 🖐 studs, we’re about to leave the solar system 🚀🚀🚀

This was always a good play. The logic and reasoning was there. A large number of shorts were in play and so long as people hold, there is money to be made. 

This requires 2 things. 
* That the retail investor buys and holds
* That the market doesn’t cheat

The first one is tough. If people start 🧻 🖐‘ing this bitch, it’s not going to work and Wall Street wins. You have to rely on a bunch of random strangers to make the same play as you, and that implies inherent risk. 

But you mother fucking autists did it! You held through everything they’ve thrown at us! I’ve never been more proud to be a retard. 

So one out of the two we’re set for, if Reddit held through that dip, they will hold through everything. If DFV can hold, I can hold. 

Which leads to the second point. Wall Street cheating. The thought is(was) that as long as this is fair, we 100% make money as long as point one holds true. The bad news is that it isn’t fair and the market always cheats, so again risky. 

Except we knew those corporate shills were going to cheat, did cheat and you fucking autists still held! You’ve proved your valor time and time again. 

Which is the wrap up. Wall Street cheated and still is losing! We know for a fact point one holds true, and because of Wall Streets cheating it will be even harder now that every eye is on them. 

This literally can’t go tits up positions all in $GME 🚀 🌙 


Bonus point*

#(The argument for why no one gets left behind.)

The first thing to say is that even after a squeeze happens keep holding. 

The reason for this is as follows. 

Firstly, Thursday the shorts position went from 140% to 250% (this is debated. Numbers came from a dd post Thursday. Though I do remember seeing total shorts go up). This means they think they can win and doubled down. So there is a lot more at play. 

But here’s why the HF will always lose if we hold. Think about the stock, it’s doing really well, but is it going to hold long term? Eventually it has to fall, right?

That’s exactly what hedge funds are thinking. They think it’s overvalued and therefore will drop. So their play is to take out more shorts. 

Except this time, the community knows this, so we just keep holding. Eventually the hedge funds can’t keep taking out shorts cause they know we will keep holding and the stock will stay stagnant with Wall Street never being able to win. Sure the price may fall gradually from 10k+, but wall street will never be able to make money cause as soon as they short, we hold. 


Hope the logic is easy to follow, I’m not a financial advisor, just someone who got high last night

It is already clear from this week that hedge funds will not go down without a fight, and why should we have expected any less. There is FUD, market manipulation, smear campaigns against us, and paid bots and shilling diversions, just more ways to get your small peasant brain to chase after the next shiny object like the plebian shit-class untouchable you are to them. So what is there to consider?

**The Fundamentals remain unchanged**

Short float is still sitting at 120% and new shorts waiting to profit off of the end drop of the squeeze are coming on board every day. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW SHORTS. This is great news in one way. The short squeeze still has the potential to blow up. You still have the potential to make fat TENDIES.

1. **DFV is still in💎 🙌**
2. **Both sides are still in💎 🙌**
3. **IM STILL MOTHERFUCKING IN**.**💎 🙌**

**Hedge funds are just as retarded as us**

Are you seriously going to believe that the people running the markets are not just as fucking stupid and arrogant. They have been winning for decades. They think we are marks and have no problem doubling their position in spite of us. They will make fatal flaws that will eventually pay off in the form of a short squeeze once they cant bear the interest.

SO HOW CAN WE GET SCREWED?

There are a number of unprecedented ways this whole scenario can go fucking sideways that you should always be aware of.

1. **We are no longer Us vs Citadel - THE SEC HALTS TRADING ON GME FOR A WEEK OR MONTH**

The world is watching, politicians are watching, other hedge funds, and retards all over the globe. Most important the SEC and the US government is watching. This has almost become a social movement, and the MOMENT it shifts from a good deal and fundamentals in the market to a social movement to fuck over the market and hedge funds the SEC will step in to protect the market.

This is because of our own weight, people joining on because they see the hype against hedge funds and not understanding the market principles behind why a short squeeze will happen.

THERE IS ALREADY PEOPLE CALLING FOR A WEEK OR MONTH LONG HALT TO PROTECT THE MARKET FROM A SOCIAL MOVEMENT. THE SEC DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

YELLEN TOOK NEARLY A MILLION IN SPEAKING FEES FROM CITADEL. SHE IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE. She cant overtly help citadel because that would be collusion but she has enough dick swing to make a freeze on both sides that would cool the momentum off on our side, and give the other side enough time to increase their covers.

2. **The players have changed**

Nobody has to disclose what short percentage they are holding. There are so many new shorts that we don't know if it is still Melvin, Citadel, or a completely new set of players at a much higher short position. I highly doubt the original players are still holding their worst short positions and if they have dropped those and put themselves in a much higher short level, the price in which we need to bring GME will increase drastically in order for them to feel the pressure.

Citadel is a FUCKING PRO, they are very fucking likely on both sides of this trade. If you don't believe they are already holding long positions, dumping their most dangerous short positions, and intending to make money UP the squeeze and DOWN the squeeze you are deluded to how hedge funds work. The smartest players play both sides.

3. **The government steps in and bails out the shorts**

This is not going to be a 2008 scenario where you all get a fat payday from daddy USA riding in a white fucking unicorn. There are people all over the world long GME and the gov would never just hand you a payout at whatever price you want. It will look like back door incentives to reduce their position. It will be behind closed doors and the percentage of the profit you will see from this will be low as fuck.

4. **Gamestop itself is forced to dilute its shares**

This is the absolutely worst-case scenario, with one fell swoop the short % would shrink below 100, the risk of a squeeze would deflate, the price would get diluted, and cause a run on GME and its collapse. This would save hedge funds and wipe everyone long GME out.

They cant do this? Don't fucking delude yourself, the government can and will strong-arm Gamestop to do whatever the fuck it feels is best to diffuse the situation if it feels like this will have an impact on the overall market.

&#x200B;

Get your fucking shit together and play the same game they are playing.

**Want to stop the SEC from fucking you?** Write letters to the SEC, Write letters to your congressmen, the governer, Joe fucking biden himself.

**Want to stick it to Melvin capital and hedge funds?** Go protest outside Zuccotti park and have the same nothing effect as the OCCUPY movement had. This GME play is SOLELY because WE LIKE THE STOCK AND THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE GOOD. WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL MOVEMENT and if thats why you are here you are fucking stupider than Melvin himself.

**Want to mentally prepare yourself for the worst? - If you're a little bitchmade paper handed pussy who will cry when you get margin called or bankrupted then reduce your fucking position asap. The people YOLOing millies here are either LOSS VETERANS or doing their DD. ACCEPT YOU MAY LOSE IT ALL AND REMEMBER THIS IS FUCKING AMERICA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.**

Ps. I am not a financial advisor or american, but Gamestop is and this whole thing can go sideways in ways you may have not thought of.

PSA: Robinhood Users - MODS PLEASE DON'T DELETE,75,l8ortf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8ortf/psa_robinhood_users_mods_please_dont_delete/,72,1612051673.0,"**TLDR: I see a lot of talk about moving and less walk.  I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**

Let me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!

**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**

1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.
2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.
3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.

**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the ""Big Boy"" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  The term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **""In Kind Transfer""**.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.

It would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).

**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.

**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (& Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.

CAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***

The transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.

**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.

I have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  \*\*I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to ""\*\****hold until Valhalla!""*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.

If people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:

* Vanguard
* TRowe Price
* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)
* Fidelity
* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)

To my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.

&#x200B;

*For whatever reason mods keep deleting my shit so I have no idea how long this will be here.  I think it's because a mod accused me of PD-ing on another sub and I called them out but I can't confirm that.*  ***If you are that mod and you read this I'm still holding that position so please consider the disservice of removing this before you do.*** *Disclosure again: I don't work for any of those brokerages mentioned above.*",2021-01-31 02:07:53

Get one thing straight idiots...GME is truly a unicorn right now. It was bet to basically go into the ground. I hope it keeps rising but let’s be real, the restriction on share count and removal of fractional shares on RH could slow this down. 

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

We're ""advised"" not to buy at the peak but when we switch to tickers that are on the bottom floor...we're told not to do that too?

Fuck that. And Fuck Wall Street.

#TL;DR (even though I literally have single word lines you lazy fucks)

Robinhood's baby gloves ticker list are the next wave because they're all severely undervalued. Wall St wants to continue to inflate big tech to screw us when they ride the wave back down.

The Robinhood Fiasco,78,l8or4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8or4p/the_robinhood_fiasco/,59,1612051619.0,"Full disclosure: I have $ in Robinhood right now and am stuck with them for the time being. Who would've thought that my joke YOLO of $5k would turn into $200k and I'd be worried about my money?


And before anyone calls me a shill: fuck those guys. If they're not colluding with hedge funds, they look shady as shit. Restricting stock, changing their policies to force sales of options BEFORE the 3:00pm EST cutoff time, and selling at the absolute worst time possible? Yeah they're gonna face some serious repercussions. The SEC, FINRA, NYSE, DOJ, FBI, Congress...they're all gonna look into what these guys did. If they find a shred of evidence of wrongdoing against old Vlad there, the dude is going to federal prison. Mark my words: he will absolutely be the fall guy. And forget about their IPO. That company is done. Fuck 'em.


I've already filed complaints with the SEC, FINRA, and NYSE, and I encourage everyone to do the same. Restricting stock trading was probably their biggest mistake, and I hope they go down for it.


Ok now that that's out of the way, here's what I think is going on over there:


Half of all Robinhood users own GME stock. That's a fucking absurd number. And we're buying the shit out of it at volumes no one has ever seen before. On top of that, we managed to get Robinhood's app to #1 in the App store. Not for investing or finance, but for EVERYTHING. That's an internet hug of death that would've overwhelmed anyone.


And everyone who downloaded it bought GME.


On top of that, despite our motto of buy and **HOLD**, there are some guys who are swing trading this shit every time it spikes and tanks. Stupid and I hope we leave them in the dust, but it's happening.


So let's say, on an average day, Robinhood does 10 million trades (no idea, making it up). On Wednesday, they did 100 million trades (example) and freaked the fuck out. When we buy/sell a stock, it looks like it's instant, but some stuff goes on behind the scenes that we'll never see. Basically, at the end of the day, all of the brokers come to the bar and settle up their tabs. And they can't use our money to do it for...reasons. So they have to have the $ available to pay their bills. These are the clearing houses you may have heard about.


And we just absolutely overwhelmed them. They were prepared for maybe up to 100 million trades overall, but not 100 million on a single stock. And not when we're also buying the shit out of AMC, BB, BBBY, and others. So what did they do? They panicked.


They restricted buying of those stocks in order to be able to pay their tabs on Thursday and Friday. They also went out and raised $1 billion from investors (good move). But what they DIDN'T do was explain wtf was going on to investors. They simply said this was for our protection and due to volatility.


This is...actually true. Sort of. They have to pay their tab. If they can't do it, we can't buy/sell at all and they could go under. And this is all because of what we're doing, which is creating massive volatility. They actually ran into a similar problem back in March last year when they raised $200 million because, again, we bought the shit out of stuff.


The CEO should have come out and said, ""Look, we're having liquidity issues that have nothing to do with bankruptcy. We're very profitable (they are), you're just buying too much, too fast, and we weren't prepared for it. So it was either this or we go under. We chose this.""


Except what would your average Redditor hear?


**OMG THEY'RE BANKRUPT!!** That would cause mass panic. We'd actually probably fuck this whole thing up. Everyone would sell their GME shares and try to rush out of Robinhood, the GME stock would tank, short sellers would win, and we'd lose the game.


And this wasn't just Robinhood. E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Webull all had the same issues. Webull wasn't as shitty about it and the CEO came out and explained, and then allowed trading again.


Over the weekend, Robinhood should come out and tell the people what's going on in a VERY calm way. Then go to Chase and secure a $10 billion line of credit for the short squeeze and tell us you're doing it. Stop restricting trading. Apologize profusely and send us all $40 DoorDash gift cards.


If you have $ with Robinhood and it's not tied up in GME, do as others have suggested and switch to Fidelity, Vanguard, Chase, etc. If you're stuck, you're stuck. If the absolute worst case scenario happens and Robinhood somehow ends up bankrupt, we have SIPC protection (like FDIC) up to $500,000. And the federal government will step in and liquidate them and try to get you your $ back as well. In almost every single instance of a broker failing, people were able to get almost all of their money back. So don't worry about that TOO much.


In the end, yes, Robinhood deserves a shit ton of blame for all of this and I hope they go bankrupt when they IPO. I think it's extremely suspicious that they have a relationship with the guys we're up against, and their actions don't look good at all. I hope we just overwhelmed them, and the coming week will probably give us more insight into whether they're innocent or guilty.


So again: fuck Robinhood for what they did. They can try to turn things around and be more transparent so we can at least trade this week. It benefits all of us to hope they succeed, because that's where most of the GME buying is happening.


**EDIT**: So why not transfer my money or shares elsewhere? Because it takes too long and we have no idea when this thing is gonna go nuclear. If I felt like I had time, believe me, these shares would be on their way to Fidelity right now. But if we hit $1,000 or $10,000/share in the next few days and my shares are locked, I won't be able to sell. They'd probably clear right around the time this thing came back down to earth. I'd want to die.",2021-01-31 02:06:59

From the last few paragraphs of her January 29th report https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-29-2021



“The Democrats’ hand has likely been strengthened this week by the media frenzy over the so-called “GameStop short squeeze,” in which hedge fund managers got squeezed by ordinary investors driving up the price of the stock of a video game retailer so that the hedge funds could not cover short sales. Investment firms promptly cried foul, only to be greeted with derision, since it is not at all clear that their own stock purchases have a better effect on the markets than those of the smaller investors, and since they made huge money betting on the Covid-19 crisis. Observers see the short squeeze as a populist attack on unscrupulous Wall Street types.

While the entire story behind the short squeeze is not yet clear, it does already have a political meaning. The GameStop story reinforced the growing sense that the system has been rigged for the wealthy. People from across the political spectrum are demanding more thorough regulation of the stock market, a dramatic cultural change.”",2021-01-31 02:01:38

But I’ve also heard people talking about Fidelity and Vanguard have access to a shit ton of shares and is the reason everyone should move. Could someone explain how fidelity and vanguard have access to all these shares but Robinhood doesn’t? Or does robinhood have the same access but is limiting investor access to them?

Why the whales are buying GME. A note on the allocation of the holdings of financial institutions concerning the Delta-Correlation of stocks with high short interest to stocks who are held by HF.,106,l8od5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8od5u/why_the_whales_are_buying_gme_a_note_on_the/,83,1612050567.0,"TLDR: **GME is the hedge for financial institutions.** 

Up to this point, I think it should be clear that HF are closing their longs in order to cover the shorts.

This means a decrease in stock price for other institutions aswell. Those institutions need to hedge that risk, but are restricted from buying puts. The only way for them to hedge is by buying stocks with a high short ratio, especially GME. Some of you might have noticed that GME is running the whole highly shorted market by now. Well thats your reason. 

Therefore the argument that retail will run out of money or Robinhood will stop the GME run is not true. **What we are witnessing right now is the downfall of the Long/Short Portfolio**. Those shills at CNBC just don´t understand *why* GME is going up. It´s not a bubble and it´s not a mania. 

I saw some posts about buying puts on SPY. First of all, that's pretty gay. Second, those smooth-brains don´t understand that **GME is the hedge against a possible downturn**.

* Nervous paperhands; **GME IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON**. Relax, look at the price action so far; there will be fluctuations with the hedgies trading shares between each other, but holy fuck **the price will always recover**. The next time a short folds, I'm expected a full-blown domino effect of panicked shorts exiting their positions. You **do not want to miss it**.
* Shorts have **lied about exiting positions**. Repeatedly. Public declarations of closing a short position? Price action to back it up? **Nope.**
* They may have lightened *some* of the more extreme shorts (GME AT 1 DOLLA etc), but their arrogance left them exposed. Why close at such a massive loss when they're *so smart* afterall, surely a bit of public manipulation, block trading on a few platforms, and the price will crash hard? **Denied** 💎🙌
* When trading platforms stopped/limited purchases of GME? Couldn't they have exited then? Sure! They could have exited some positions at optimal timing. But lets look at the short %; They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up (credit to the Bot Spam ;P)
* Volume of Puts that expired on Friday is astronomical, more in the coming weeks. What does this mean? More pain for those bearish hedge lads.
* Fintel is saying a big fat on Shares Available to Short ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)), this is as of 28th.
* Given the lack of MASSIVE bursts on Friday, and somewhat sideways trading, we can assume minimal shorts exited then. They wanted to control the price, and finish below 320 (huge Call volume there). They failed. And why? Because GME is a global phenomenon, retail investors, and sympathetic whales moving in for the kill.

And finally, look at that glorious **STRONG BUY** rating 💎🙌 Hold those shares fellow retards; for those of you not yet in the game, it's never too late. I've seen some nervy posts, be wary of disinformation tactics and paper hands (check user profiles and account age).

What is that? 
Well thats when you make a trade, it takes 2 days after that for the funds to settle. Some brokers have a T+1 rule

Because of this, Robin the hood had to limit the amount of shares being sold because of increased Margin requirements up to 100%. 

Now if I havent lost you I have easily already lost my original thought but heres my point.

WHY DO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAKE SO LONG? 

If we buy the stock with the money in our account thats legit there and ours, why isnt the full transaction from both ends cleared up in 1 day or hours? 

Its starting to look like that (other trading thing I cant name cause its banned) could start to have some real life uses....

$GME - a glimpse from the other side of the trade,27,l8oa2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8oa2a/gme_a_glimpse_from_the_other_side_of_the_trade/,78,1612050272.0,"The reason I was even in on the $GME trade is because I believe equity analysts lack imagination. I've used the example of when NFLX shipped DVDs in the mail [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4cvmt/why_im_long_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to illustrate my view that people who have majored in Finance/Accounting are going to value a company by what it's traditionally done, and not by what it *could* do.

But as I watch the hundreds and hundreds of posts about $GME now I worry that **Reddit Retail** is now falling into the trap of lacking imagination.

So, think of the Spongebob ""Imagination!"" meme for a second and then follow along with me: if I were at a Short Hedge Fund that was still Short $GME I would flatten my position next week by completely bypassing the Stock Market.

The Institutional and Fund Holding rates of $GME is over 70%, which means that only around 20% of the float is free to trade when you discount Insiders. So since Short Hedge Funds need shares to unwind, the two places they can go are the stock market and Dark Pools.

Now if you don't know what Dark Pools are, you might want to pause and rethink sinking your entire life savings into meme stocks. Dark Pools are private exchanges set up for Funds to move massive amounts of stock invisibly and without causing volatility. A Fund Long $GME simply offers up a block of stock and Short Funds can bid on it. I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.

Interestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it's actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund. Funds that shorted $GME are currently being vilified (I personally see Shorts as being an important part of the financial ecosystem) and I'm not sure any Longs would want to be known as having bailed them out.

As they are ‘on order’ they cannot be lent out by your broker and in turn you are reducing the amount of ‘free shares’ out there that can be used for shorting purposes. And don’t forget to move your limit order up when the price starts to recover, then, that way your shares can’t be shorted.

""your brokerage firm cannot lend out your stocks without your permission. However, you may have signed a customer agreement that explicitly allows your broker to lend out your securities. This clause is often tucked deep within the customer agreement, and few investors pay much attention to it. ""

I personally see this as being wrong because the brokers are the one's using our shares profiting off of us because we apparently agreed to it in the fine print of a 500 page agreement.

What about the biggest [naked short of them all Lehman brothers](https://bit.ly/3cjEBP2)? 

[Lehman CTs are still trading](https://yhoo.it/2NAQhCI.), and shorts may not have covered. 

On 1/26/2021 there was a 2X increase in 3 month average volume across all CTs with rise in price.  

On 1/27/2021 there was a 4X increase in 3 month avg volume across all CTs. 

Some news may be coming up or someone knows something.

# From the above article, $170000 of shorter funds is still blocked for 68013 shares, giving the bankrupt shorted Lehman shares a value of almost $2.5/share.

Lehman may reemerge from Bankruptcy this year with 50 billion dollars in net operating losses (NOLS) that can be purchased by big boys to set off their potential profits. 

Also Lehman CTs pay a 6% dividend (on a face value of $25/share equivalent to at least $1.5 share/dividend) as per prospectus agreements which has been suspended due to bankruptcy proceedings

The clue that Lehman may reemerge from the ashes are:

· The preservation of the NOL of $50 billion

· The 24.1B cash back 

· And the most recent clue is when they announce the dividend and ongoing business in UK.

Lehman Brothers may soon rise from its ashes in 2021. 

In 2008 it was estimated to recover only 36 Billion, and as of date it has [recovered more than $100 billion to its creditors.](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/01/creditor-recovery-in-lehmans-bankruptcy.html)

It holds net operating losses NOL of $ 50 billion and potential NOLS of $150 billion that make it a prime acquisition target when it reemerges.

# The best part of these NOLS is that according to IRS rules, existing Lehman shareholders must be majority owners of the company when they reemerge for them to continue to retain the tax benefits of the NOLS.

The potential $150 billion in NOLS can be written against their potential profits off by companies that acquire these NOLS upto 2028 . Only the big boys will be interested in such a large amount of NOLs and these NOLS could be worth billions of dollars.

This could finally be our jackpot after waiting for 12 years. Most of Lehman shares are in one big share OBS (escrow) and dont trade. Only the [four CTs trade](https://yhoo.it/2NAQhCI.).

As you can see, GME is in consolidation a very well defined Bull Flag which by these technicals should be breaking out of sometime this next week.  If we apply Eliot Curve thesis to this, we are currently in the B wave of the A-B-C pattern.  The way these typically play out is by applying the A wave to the end of the B wave, which should give us an idea of how big the next move will be (the C wave).  By these technicals, I'm showing the next move up should put GME around $650-$700.

[Charts in question](https://ibb.co/album/TrQtGN).

Thousands of $GME enthusiasts from all around the globe bought shares of the company they like. I always thought this was the core principal of a free market - you like some company (for any reason you can name), you buy it's shares, this company gets additional capital to finance it's development/operations/research/etc which results in the consumer receiving better goods/services provided by given company, this company appreciates in value, you as an investor profit off of it, everyone's happy.

But there's always someone on the other side of every bet, remember? It seems like that **someone** is quite unhappy with the **commons** taking away their tendies and beating them fair and square at their own game. Probably you have seen media *talking heads advocating for ultra wealthy and blaming it all on the retail trader* (which is absurd by any definition, but they simply don't care - they're doing their job which they are payed for).

You've also probably heard their thesis that everything's about to go under and blah blah blah if commons don't surrender. Which is interesting by itself, so will *everything and everyone* indeed go under or just some *financial institutions that are on the losing side of the bet*? Probably the latter.

So here's the question (which is not a financial advice by any means, I'm just exercising my right for freedom of speech and voicing my opinion here): *what will happen to the share prices of those financial institutions that took the losing side of the bet and are bleeding money in billions already*? How will their next quarterlies look like? What if **commons took their capital away from these institutions by shorting enemy stock and channeled it to the company they liked and believed in**?

Dont get propagandized this is the real reason why they are terrified of us.

Hedge funds don't get unlimited money they dont got papa jpow's printer (yet). How do they raise money? By showing good returns and getting investors. So the hedge fund goes out there and tells all the millionaires that hey we can give you 10% returns on these regardless of market conditions and we are the only ones who can do it since we are oh so smart. Then we come along and we flip the script. By now, every single millionaire around the world has heard about GME and what we have done. Melvin was the poster child of hedge fund, their messiah of just how ""smart"" they are and they paraded them to show why hedge funds are the only way to make money. And we are taking them down without barely lifting a finger.

This is what scares them. The rest of the hedge funds dont give a shit about Melvin capital losing billions, less competition for them! But by now they have gotten calls from every one of their investor and realized these guys are just as stupid as my 10 year old why do I need them in the first place? Is all the research and analyst calls and all just for me to buy into this scheme? If enough people pull their investments from them and put it into indices THEY ARE FUCKED. Hedge funds only have power because of their collective bargaining of their investors. Once you chip away that power they are just glorified wsb users. Hedge funds fight other hedge funds every single fucking day and it barely registers on the news anymore but this is a direct attack on their way of doing business and that's why you are seeing  monumental amount of hedge fund apologists coming out to attack us.

TLDR: I am neither your dad (maybe) nor you financial advisor. Hedge funds are scared because we are attacking their bottom line. All I want to see is Melvin capital go bankrupt and this scam exposed for the world to see.

But REMEMBER to have the most fun with your money by giving it away and back to the communities that got you to where you could be today. (Small amounts count and mean the world to others when they think their world is crashing).

Everything had to line up in the world sequentially for all of this to happen for you.

I am a firm believer that the more you can make an impact with your money - the more happier and fun your life will become. You don't have to give away thousands or millions regularly. Go to Walmart and pay off a layaway. Pay for the food for the person behind you. Be a good person. Make the difference.

Understand that as fast as you aquired this money, is as fast as it can disappear if you don't put some away. (hence the billionaires panicking).

Also, don't forget to support the businesses you cashed in on. This is pretty much a once in a lifetime to save your country post-pandemic from decline of past lifestyle hobbies.

I keep asking myself...


Why the fuck was $BB limited too, they fucking got caught shorting [before this news](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) which is huge, that's full partnership all the way to market in a car manufacturer huge.

They lost and used $GMEs momentum to halt it and hide, then short ladder attacked it all week (in the literal matching pattern of GME and AMC)

You know how fucking hard that is to stop when they limited a $15(was $27) to 5 shares?

&nbsp;

*By slowing $BB I theorize they may have showed more of their cards than you think*.... *hear me out.*


***Theory:***  They run algos as a hedge ""group"" however many invested in and benefit from the trade data of retail (let's call them dipshits) 

Dipshits found an algo that has been printing free money for years, simple. Every play you see retail doing, wait until I hits certain metrics and short the fuck out of it to collect paychecks. 


Problem being: these moved faster than dipshits algo could ge recognize so it saw more sentiment and went for more shorts.

*and they don't have an off button*

So combine that with the bots spamming social media (that their algos monitor for plays) and dipshits were getting metrics readouts that said free money here. 

So they asked for $2.75 billion more to put on it. 

Dipshits iterally only have one play, to wait until a group gets excited and then short the stock for your money - ***and it's not fucking working*** so they stopped the game to try to turn it off (notice they still bought more short positions this week)

The $BB short position was only 7% shorts, so by their volatility definition it doesn't apply(so again why stop trade).... but it's now 9% shorted *after that news?!?*

GME Short Squeeze: Act II,7435,l8nvir,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8nvir/gme_short_squeeze_act_ii/,1030,1612049068.0,"Good day, fellow retards.  We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It’s apparent by now that it’s not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they’re going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.

&#x200B;

For a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:

\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.

\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions

\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.

\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.

&#x200B;

We held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.

Melvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it’s very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they’ve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.

If GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.

&#x200B;

How can we know this is likely true?:

\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering

\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above

\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.

\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they’ll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.

&#x200B;

So basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn’t cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it’s costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.

TLDR:  💎 🙌 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Explaining Robinhood’s Fuckup,81,l8nq2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8nq2m/explaining_robinhoods_fuckup/,135,1612048571.0,"TLDR: They ran out of cash and can’t use customer cash as collateral. Brokers that had more collateral were not affected or were not affected to the same degree.  

Edit: This is an explanation not a defense.  Fuck them. They didn’t explain that they fucked up and basically got margin called. I didn’t use them but if I did I would have changed brokers instantly.  The reason this is important is not just because of GME but because it happened to many brokerages and that means there is liquidity stress in the market right now.  

Article from the FT:

The crucial role played by clearing houses in financial markets has been thrust into the spotlight after contentious moves by US brokers such as Robinhood and Charles Schwab to restrict retail investors’ bets on stocks at the heart of the Reddit-fuelled trading boom.

Customers reacted angrily on Thursday as brokers moved to stop them opening new positions in certain red-hot stocks, accusing them of unfair treatment or even a Wall Street establishment plot. But the brokers gave a more mundane explanation: the extra volatility in share prices meant they had to hold more capital at the institutions that clear their trades.

What do clearing houses do?
These unobtrusive venues normally sit in the background of daily market activity but they can become the centre of attention during periods of volatility when they require more cash — or “margin” — from their members to ensure that deals are honoured as customers expect.

An equities trade that has been executed can take up to two days to be legally settled, creating a risk of it failing if either side of the trade defaults. A clearing house stands between the two sides to manage the risk to the market if that happens.

Each day members of the clearing house, which range from small brokers like Robinhood to big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, are required to put up margin as insurance for their trades.

The amount is calculated by the clearing house and is based on the amount of trading carried out by each member, as well as the volatility of the individual securities traded. Margin is generally collected at the start of the trading day, although there can be intraday calls in frenzied periods, in an attempt to protect the wider market from sudden trade failures.

The clearing member often has limited time to make up the shortfall and the margin typically has to be an asset that is highly liquid, such as cash, US government bonds or shares. In the middle of the market volatility last March, one US bank was required to find $9.6bn of margin for derivatives trades within an hour.

How do brokers such as Robinhood fit into this?
In common with rivals such as Schwab and ETrade, Robinhood clears its own trades and is a member of the main US equities clearing house, run by DTCC.

While self-clearing saves on the fees that would otherwise go to another clearing broker, it also means Robinhood takes on the risk that an executed trade does not settle, and needs to have more cash on hand to cover shortfalls. It also faces higher costs if the clearing house raises margin requirements in volatile periods to protect against a member default. 

“The extreme volatility is a big factor behind this,” said Andy Nybo, managing director at Burton-Taylor International Consulting. “They need to make sure they are able to meet cash requirements, whether it is for clearing or to investors that are owed money due to trading activity.”

As Robinhood said in a blog post on Thursday, the requirements “can be substantial in the current environment.” It declined to comment further.

Between Wednesday and Thursday, the margin call from DTCC across the US equities market rose from $26bn to $33.5bn, the clearing house confirmed.

DTCC said the frenzied trading in shares such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment “generated substantial risk exposures at firms that clear these trades . . . particularly if the clearing member or its clients are predominantly on one side of the market.”

How did brokers respond?
Safety mechanisms built into the market’s infrastructure across Wall Street led to periodic halts in trading activity on Thursday. In order to ensure they had enough money to cover margin and capital requirements, Robinhood and others such as Schwab and TD Ameritrade raised margin for trading on some of the names at the heart of the volatility, which required more cash be set aside after each trade.

This limited its margin needs from escalating further. By allowing users to close positions, it was still permitting trades that would reduce its immediate need for cash.

Robinhood also raised the margin requirements for customers that had not paid for the total value of their trading up front, having cut its margin requirements in December in an attempt to drive more trading activity. That meant some customers suddenly needed to come up with cash to cover trades.

Behind the scenes, Robinhood moved to raise a fresh $1bn in capital from its existing investors, which it announced ahead of trading on Friday. The company said the fundraising was a “strong sign of confidence from investors that will help us continue to further serve our customers”.

Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, another company that was forced to restrict trading in some shares, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that its clearing firm “simply could not afford” the cost of entering into new trades.

“This has nothing to do with a decision or some sort of closed, cigar smoke filled room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader,” he said.

————————-
Simpler Explanation from Comments 
————————

RH and other similar execution firms have to post collateral with the DTCC every time a position is opened. This collateral is to protect the DTCC in the event of the market moving against the position between the time of execution and the time the trade settles (T+2) AND the execution firm failing to settle the trade by being unable to come up with the cash (in the case of a purchase) or the shares (in the case of a sale). 

When a share is particularly volatile, the DTCC will up the collateral requirements it imposes on both buyer and seller. When the trade does finally settle the collateral is returned.

RH and other execution firms are prohibited from using client funds for this purpose, which must remain in a segregated account until settlement is finalised. Even if RH decline to allow margin trading on certain volatile stocks, insisting that buyers stump up the full purchase price, this money cannot be used for the 2 day period when RH has to post collateral. If RH executed a sell order during this period, that would reduce DTCC's risk and allow it to return collateral to RH rather than ask for more. This collateral could be re-used by RH, allowing it to make another purchase on behalf of a client. This is why RH could accept sell orders nut not buy orders periodically. Once it had executed enough sell orders, which freed up collateral, it could then offer to accept buy orders, until the collateral ran out again. This is why the blocks on buy orders were periodic - they hit their collateral limit, so stopped accepting buy orders. They executed sell orders which freed up collateral (and collateral was returned as trades settled), allowing them to offer buy orders agin, until the collateral limit was hit again, when they had to once again suspend buy orders. etc etc

And ran out, it did. RH's business model is based on a steady stream of small orders on both the buy sand sell side. If it is executing both buys and sells consistently over time, as far as DTCC is concerned it has very little risk to RH so doesn't need to ask for much collateral to be posted. Hence RH had never planned for a situation where it would be asked to post large quantities of collateral (potentially $billions).

So, it ran out of collateral that it would need to post for buy orders, but sell orders would free up collateral. It arranged a convertible bond issue with existing shareholders that raised $500m immediately, and hopefully another $500m in a few days and it drew down on a loan facility it had with its banks. But still not enough. 

The issue RH (and others experienced) is the ridiculously long time it still takes to settle trades (it could be more or less immediate) and the rules that prevent it using client funds as collateral (if settlement was immediate, the client funds wouldn't remain in the segregated account, but would be used immediately to settle the trade).

But it is what it is. If RH wants to execute trades it has to be able to put up the collateral. If it doesn't have the collateral, it can't execute trades (at least the trades that require collateral). But the wider market remained open. Anyone could buy or sell shares at all times. They just needed to put up the collateral themselves for the 2 day settlement period, or find someone who would do so on their behalf.

#HOWEVER


At some point, as has happened to pretty much all short squeezes,


##Gamestop will offer shares to the shorts at some point. 


They already have a 100m dollar offer lined up, but they could easily offer more. Why would they do this? Because it would make them a fuck ton of money. 

At the end of the day, Gamestop is a business. They are in the midst of a huge transition, and the ability to clear debt and have more cash on hand during this time would be life changing money for this company. AMC did it this past week, it happened during the VW squeeze when
Porsche offered stock and made a fortune. Gamestop will likely do the same thing. They'd be absolutely stupid not too. 


What does this mean? Well, it means that your 69420 per share probably isn't going to happen, but I still expect a big ol squeeze is in the works. Just be prepared for this type of announcement, and when the dust settles let's make sure we continue to support the company.

Before, the shady activity of the brokerages was hidden from the general public. They were able to manipulate the markets all they wanted and get away with it because the ""commoners"" didn't care or understand. 

Now, with millions of retain investors that flooded the market, a shift in ""market influence"" in favor of smaller, amateur traders. And the gargantuan, amorphous investment firms didn't like that at all. 

It has become a battle of market influence, and the hedge funds and brokerages with massive amounts of capital are doing WHATEVER IT TAKES (illegal or not) to make sure that they retain that authority that they previously held for so many years. (flooding certain stocks with short positions, disabling certain stocks)

But with investment firms taking blatant illegal action to accomplish their goals, their shady activity has been revealed for the world to see and it seem as of now, that the general public, as well as some democrat lawmakers have taken an interest to them. (It also shows how corrupt the SEC is with them taking their sweet time to decide which side they want to be on)

Hopefully through this incident, the integrity of the US markets can be improved with dishonest brokerages being dissolved. (I think it is wishful thinking that market makers such as Citadel could be dissolved, considering the HUGE number of brokerages with reliance to the company)",2021-01-31 01:01:50

I am not taking it anymore ....... Seriously I am fucking done

Yesterday I started looking over everything I have sold the last 20 years. NVDA at 120 due to the Citron short, AAPL 90 pre split due to all the sell side analysis saying over extended, over priced, and the list just goes on and on. ISRG which was one of my favorites of all time I sold at 18. Now they limit the amount of shares I can buy in a company. I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.

Starting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.

In regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more. If I die on this hill then so be it, but it's the last time I get manipulated.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

In addition I have money going to brokerages that can't restrict what I buy. It will be there on Monday

Edit 1: I am not cashing out my 401k to stick it into GME. I am cashing out and letting it sit in a money market for a while. Same with all my other accounts. No I am not going to withdraw my 401k just let it sit in a money market for a while.

Thursday morning the entire market was on the brink of another financial crisis.,5279,l8nap0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8nap0/thursday_morning_the_entire_market_was_on_the/,1095,1612047287.0,"For many of you reading this you may not understand what truly happened Thursday morning. We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment. Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.

&nbsp;


TLDR; Had the ""FREE MARKET"" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds.

&nbsp;

**Understanding Leverage:**

Many people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market. These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM (Assets under management) they are likely leveraged up 5-10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60-120 Billion. If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage. This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.

&nbsp;

**The entire market was at systemic risk.**


They had no out so they changed the game. The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every ""meme"" stock. Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller/buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.

&nbsp;


**Changing collateral requirements suddenly**


Well guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to **100%**. This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock. This is the true culprit behind whats going on. ***The Citadel*** was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses. This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15-20%. They COULD NOT let this happen. You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?

&nbsp;

**A coordinated attack on retail investors:**

I have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday. These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position. Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages. Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core. You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD. This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.

&nbsp;


**Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup:**

So what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.

$GME 1000


$BB    50


$AMC  30


$NOK  12

Open letter to the SEC about why this is rational investors in a free market and not collusion.,1625,l8n8au,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8n8au/open_letter_to_the_sec_about_why_this_is_rational/,203,1612047088.0,"Through the free spread of information, many investors who understand how shorting works and know the history of the VW squeeze of 2008, were able to inform many other investors that GME had a very similar setup to the VW squeeze of 2008 (its worse but that’s not relevant). This sharing of information is not illegal or any type of market manipulation, since it is all true to the best of our knowledge at the time the statements were made (the data we can access says the short interest has been over 100% of the float for a long time now). It is not illegal for one investor to inform another investor about truthful (or perceived truthful) information. 

From there, many investors simultaneously made the decision that it was in their best interest financially to buy GME stock in the hopes of triggering a VW like squeeze. 

Example: when this hit mainstream news, a friend called me and said “explain short squeezes like I am five and why GME has the potential to be one”. So I (a semi-experienced investor) did so to the best of my ability, whilst disclosing that I am currently holding GME shares. This individual then made his OWN decision to invest a significant portion of his portfolio hoping to at least double his money. 

We have also spread the information that, the less people sell, the worse position that puts the short sellers of this stock into trouble. From there, people have made their own decisions. Those of us that think enough people will hold to trigger a larger squeeze are holding while some people have sold thinking the squeeze was already over. 

Again, we are not colluding in secret to agree to buy/hold a certain amount of shares together. No one knows how many GME shares we (the retail investors discussing this) collectively own. We are just spreading information about what CAN happen if investors behave in a certain way and people are rationally choosing simultaneously hold/buy from there, which appears like collusion.

Edit: disclaimer that I still hold GameStop shares.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they’ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there’s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let’s move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I’ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I’ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I’m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple’s stock price rises and Gamestop’s (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn’t go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let’s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what’s known as an arbitrage trade. I’ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It’s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go someone's way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I’ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I’ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it’s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn’t block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I’ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

**AMC**

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren’t valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It’d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you’ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you’re willing to lose. Diamond hands.

This [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8bwtx/why_gme_fundamentals_dont_matter_for_gme_stock/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how you're not just buying $GME when you buy their stock. You're also buying a stake in all the hedgies shorting it. 

Then this [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hxs6/burning_questions_on_gme_no_one_in_sec_will_answer/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how it's not just the hedgies shorting $GME. There's a big bank backing the hedgies; like a too-big-to-fail big bank (TBTFBB).

So all these CNBC boomers taking about $GME fUnDaMeNtAlS are just fucking with us. Here's what's probably the truth (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. AM RETARDED): 

Since more shares of $GME are sold short than actually exist (~110-120%), we're getting a 10-20% discount on a TBTFBB, AND GameStop's business. This applies at ANY share price as long as the shorted shares exceed existing shares. This assumes there's a TBTFBB backing the hedgies, that the squeeze is successful, and that we sell when the squeeze occurs. In other words, our investment is backed by the fucking US Government.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
> “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
> “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
> But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

I think we all need to be prepared for what other shenanigans these types will come up with next week. Here's what I can think of:

1. Some brokers will continue imposing limits on certain securities (what you can buy, how much you can buy, and so on). This will continue to suppress demand.

2. SEC may get involved and [suspend trading for 10 days](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions.htm) ""for the protection of investors"". This will have an impact on holders of near-dated options. I am most worried about this.

3. Technical outage. There are billions of dollars at stake here (trillions if the stock market collapses), so what's a few ""outages"" that will ease volatility and cool sentiments?

Prisoner's Dilemma - 💎🖐️ $GME 🚀,288,l9cnx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9cnx6/prisoners_dilemma_gme/,102,1612129908.0,"This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.

Earlier today I [tried to debunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.

Then I read this awesome post about how [we're being manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from all sides.

This made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we've already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, normies will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we're just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. They need to know why we're retarded this time.

Enter the $GME [prisoner's dilemma game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Here's the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.

The only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won't) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best collective outcome is if they... 💎🖐️ $GME.

The Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other for the best individual outcome. That's the mathematical equilibrium/outcome choice. However, I'm arguing that we've demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We're using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We're maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.

TLDR: 💎🖐️ $GME.

I went through and look through a few SLV supporters accounts and about 18 out of 20, were brand new accounts with no Karma. I down voted these accounts and commented to keep track of them. As soon as I would go back through my comments looking for these accounts, it was deleted.

No we won’t you stupid fuck, we didn’t do shit other than buy stocks we like and post emojis.

Hedge funds on the other hand are the ones that went full fuNdaMenTAl and will have a broader impact on the stock market. They first started with the bright idea of shorting a company like Gamestop with more shares than in EXISTENCE (140%) to push the stock to rock bottom prices (3$), all while ignoring the fact that Gamestop is a cyclical company on the cusp of a new console cycle with no bankruptcy risk. Hedge funds could of pared down their positions (you know, risk management) after seeing smart investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen pile in. 

Instead hedge funds doubled down on their hubris and extra chromosome. They fought the rise every step of the way with every dirty trick imaginable - digging their own hole deeper every step of the way. Had hedge funds covered when they were supposed to, GME might have popped from 3$ to 30$, and been a giant nothing-burger. 

Now, these fucks have dug themselves so deep that they have to start liquidating the other parts of their portfolio just to stay afloat. Just like when these hedge fund fucks pull a dirty short ladder attack and flood the market with artificial supply (thereby decreasing the stock price), these morons are now also flooding the market with actual stocks selling at a discount.

Now Mr. Media Shill, before you wipe that hedge fund cum-stain off your chin and appear on TV screeching “the sTonKmaRKet is TANKING!!!!11!1” - take a moment and spin up that smooth brain of yours.

Who were the investors who propped up the stock-market after the Covid crash in ‘20? Pro-tip, it wasn’t some institutional hack appearing on TV to declare we have found the bottom. It was retail investors who started snapping up discounted equities.

Where do you think retail is going to spend the GME stimmy checks? Not only are we going snap up discounted stocks and prop up the stonkmarket, we’ll actually provide some real value to the economy by actually paying our taxes and spending our money in the real world. So get fucked Mr, Media Shill - never go full fuNdaMenTAl

How many times HF's brought down a company just to take it over and grow it for own profit? 

I believe in GME. I believe gaming has a huge future and I believe GME will restructure and will get profitable. I will buy from them (even tho in my country they do not operate, I will buy and donate stuff to charity, hospitals, whatever), I will try to be a part of the growth as mich as I can. Its what HF's do, but this is the right way. Without destroying a company before doing so. 

This is new for them. How on earth can we do this to the privileged, wealthy managers? 

We should not only LIKE the stock, we should also SUPPORT the company we like. And I'm sure many of us will and this my fellow retards, this is the change to the market we should provide.  

Build, not destroy. Unless its a fucking criminal HF who deserve all of it.

First, thanks for being on the good side of the history for those who showed us some kind of support. I think it’s safe to assume that at this point there are sharks on the both sides of the play, and those who now play on our side, at the end won’t care much if we made or lost money - they want to kill other HFs and make their own share, that’s it. 

But there’s something different that matters: greedy short sellers. Innovative entrepreneurs over the last years suffered heavy loses, both mental and material, due to aggressive short selling, manipulation and scare tactics by the media and „analysts”. Some people, like Elon, showed them their place. But some couldn’t fight and lost bigly. Here I am, asking all of you, multi-millionaires, billionaires, to show support to the cause one more time and end aggressive short selling forever, because this is what will likely happen after this thing is done. At least SEC will prohibit shorting over 100% float.   
 

**Let them bleed more, like the stock with us.**  


Because we, thanks to the free exchange of information, fundamentals of the company, and apparently free market, liked the stock together and don’t plan on disliking it soon. We’ll probably like it even more soon!

PSA: Get your broker problem records together (my documentation tips),115,l94l2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94l2p/psa_get_your_broker_problem_records_together_my/,29,1612096420.0,"Obligatory I'm not a lawyer nor anybody with any type of legal credentials for anything.  

However, you are allowed to talk to lawyers if you're comfortable doing that and I have personally favorably resolved several financially significant disputes with large corporations have tried to take advantage of me in a very formal way.  

I'd never recommend that to anybody.  It's very scary.  But I can share how I get my ducks in a row when it feels like things are going off the rails so you have that information should you ever need it.

I just saw the post about an error in accessing Robinhood statements, which apparently may be required to transfer assets.  I assume that is the case since Fidelity has this bullet point as the first in their transfer steps FAQ:

**""A statement from your current firm to reference""**

While this may be a temporary technical problem they have lost credibility.  There are already pending class actions from the trading outage that have been posted.  There will be more if they continue to have problems.  I'm sure the nature of those problems, benign or otherwise will come to light through these processes.

If they liquidated your positions without knowledge or consent they provided the evidence for you on that one.  But there could be other issues where it cannot hurt to establish you were trying to do where it could be less concrete.

So I don't know what else might go down, but I think a lot of people like me are done and will move everything out.  I hope it goes smoothly, but just in case you are worried here are the steps I usually take when I feel like a large company is going to violate any kind of agreement or fail in an important process. 

Your level of exposure and confidence may dictate how deep you go on this, but it's my full freight exercising my rights as a customer path.

1. As soon as you hit something that caused you a problem make a screenshot.  Do it again and make another screenshot.  If it involves some actual transaction execution make a screenshot of whatever you are trying to trade

2. Send a customer service ticket with a LOT of detail.  What you were trying to do, what went wrong, anything relevant to the details of the transaction.  Take a screenshot before you send.  It goes without saying, but keep all this stuff organized and in one place

3. Get a Google Voice or similar service number.  You can call yourself and start recording and then call customer service.  When you call be very nice.  The person you are talking to is just like you and mostly they deal with morons who forgot their password.  Tell them you are recording.  If you are angry tell them, but don't BE angry.  I can't stress that enough.  Tell them you sent the support ticket.  Repeat all the details.  I have sent recordings to lawyers on the other side before.  They do the trick.  I have sat in a room with a whole senior management team and several corporate lawyers on the phone and called their bluff when they said they had recordings of me indicating I wanted something other than what I got.  I just kept telling them to play it until they suddenly didn't think it needed to come to that and we started talking what we could do to fix it

4. Call back and do it again.  See if you get the same answer.  Having two employees tell me the exact same thing after the company did the exact opposite to me has paid off before

5. Write this stuff down in order as you do it.  Make sure you have names right.  Ask for best call back numbers, resolution times, any promised restitution (that's also why the recordings), and additional ticket numbers that get opened.  If you have a log it's easy to go back and say X agent told me Y on this day and I can send you the recording in 5 minute

6. Go download all those customer agreements you have to plow through.  Send more tickets and ask them to confirm those are the versions that you agreed to when opening the account or the last update you agreed to.  If policies are changing rapidly it does not hurt to to have a record of what the expectation was.  This is really boring, but who knows

7. If you can get to statements go ahead and save the most recent at least.  If a platform goes down you want to have your account info handy

I hope you don't need any of this and someone can give you some more tips.  However, before rage quitting if something does negatively impact you get organized.",2021-01-31 14:33:40

You don't want to mix high emotions and the stock market no matter what the circumstances are. The Wallstreetbet community which has now seen its membership grow exponentially is now filled with emotionally charged language, emojis and high morale as they draw first blood from the hedge funds. They are now rallying the entire world to ""fight their cause"" by jumping into the stock. Maniac investing, sky rocketing prices, emotions, FOMO, irrationality, bubble anyone?

Financial strains are appearing in the system. Robinhood drew down all their credit lines and raised 1 billion with existing investors. Although we didn't hear from Etrade, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers, we expect them to face similar stress as evident by their share trading restriction. Back in 2015, the surprise announcement by Swiss National Bank to remove the 1.20 EURCHF peg caused massive volatility that led to the insolvency of fx brokers. Brokers are built to function with certain volatility assumptions and things are fine 99.999% of the time until a Black Swan shows up. Brokers are important clogs in the stock market mechanism and they cannot afford to fail in unison. Short brokerages appear to be a good trade here.

It may not stop with GME. GME is now $320, up  10x from the beginning of the year. Mob investors who missed the boat already have other targets in their crosshairs; AMC, Express, Bed Bath Beyond and Blackberry. This will further exacerbate the problem. 

Hedge funds, the villains of the industry have their fair share of failures in their storied past, but non as humiliating as this. Weak, vulnerable retail investors came to the realisation that, when well orchestrated in a community, they can take on these giants and beat them at their game. But hedge funds also serve an important role in price discovery and their sheer magnitude of their operation are a systemic risk to the markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a 3.6b bailout of LTCM in 1998 to prevent a wider collapse of the financial system. Indeed, in the 2008 subprime crisis, the suspension of 2 BNP hedge funds in the summer of 2007 also marked the precipice of the crisis before things start to unravel.",2021-01-31 14:33:15

Well unfortunately for them, they underestimated the diamond hands of WSB and we finished in the GREEN on Friday, putting every single 1/29 option that was written before Wednesday ITM. If you look at the charts, SPY dropped JUST as GME turned around in the market. This means that the funds knew that they would have to close out on Monday and raised their cash positions on Friday near close.

Zero liquidity on GME and what that means,458,l94j6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94j6a/zero_liquidity_on_gme_and_what_that_means/,320,1612096243.0,"Not financial advice, I’m long GME,  
I’m also retarded considering I was wrong about the gamma squeeze on Friday. I was under the impression all brokerages would allow unlimited buying of GME, but Robinhood kept lowering the amount you could buy. (I feel that if brokerages didn’t continue blocking buying of shares I would have been right) 

Quick side note if you have a call contract for GME I believe you can exercise it and exceed the purchasing limit for shares.( They may not change that before Monday) 


Ok now on to the main point what does zero liquidity mean? It’s essentially the fact that for GME there is close to no sellers at this point. Everyone who has their shares are holding on tight to them, so people who need to buy shares like shorts are forced to pay the price the seller chooses. With little to no one wanting to sell shares there is almost no competition between sellers trying to ask less than their competitors. This means that people are able to sell at far higher prices than if the stock was liquid. 

Zero liquidity is very good for us because we can could sell at the prices we name, and when people are forced to buy they might buy almost about any price. There were shares sold at 2,400 while it was trading below 500$. Just think about that when it’s trading at 2k. There is also still 121% short float that means that ever single one of us will be able to exit our positions when shorts cover, and their will still be people buying after we have exited. This isn’t counting any new shorts who are ballsy and try to time the top at their own peril. 

How do we know that we are close to zero liquidity? We can observe that by the actions of market participants, and by some other things such as the bid -ask spread. There have been moments where the bid- ask spread was over a 1,000$ difference in price. This means that the lowest price someone was willing to sell at was far higher than the current market price of a security. There was a fill allegedly for a 2,400$ sell this week which means that, it was the lowest price available in the market. The bid - ask difference has also peaked out of the cracks a few times, which must have been infuriating for shorts showing that no one was falling for their scare tactics. This is in  addition to a vast reduction in volume throughout the duration of the squeeze so far. 

Institutions have also been limiting the amount of shares you can buy which is very telling that things are very bad right now. The brokerages are doing this knowing full well that they will lose clients and their reputation over this, but are under so much pressure from outside forces that they do this anyway. There have also been less and less short attacks with all the stop losses already being triggered by previous attacks, and the fact they are next to useless if no one will sell at the low prices. 

Something that bodes will for our positions is also that there is big money on our side as well. There a lot of funds that have entered the fray looking for the legendary returns this has the potential to pull off. Institutions and whales recently have done a lot to save our ass recently and patch the holes that shorts were poking in our boat. While retail has had limited buying abilities they have been buying up as many remaining shares as they can get their hands on. There’s also the added fact of some HFT on our side buying shares on the short ladder attack and exerting heavier tolls on shorts. Some big money being on our side + public support + billionaires (Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc) and some politicians like AOC and Ted Cruz all decrease the chance of the SEC intervening and screwing longs over. 

Remember this though while the institutions and funds want the price to go up and are on our side as of now. They are no better than Melvin our interest are just aligned momentarily they will screw you if they make more money. 

I believe there is some undiagnosed systemic risk at play as well. If funds are forced to cover at prices above 1k they are going bankrupt but will still be forced to cover their positions. My understanding of this is that if a fund doesn’t have enough capital to meet an obligation their broker is forced to step in and take the loss. Think of it like margin for a retail trader, if you sell box spreads and have 1k of collateral but take a 1mil loss the broker takes the loss while you are force to pay them back at a later date. What if you go insolvent though? Well the brokers stuck holding that loss until they are paid back if they ever are paid back. That’s in addition with Robin Hood needing to raise an additional 1billion dollars likely as additional collateral. 

Ok what to do with this information? If the prices are to high when they are forced to cover some institutions might be completely liquidated in addition to others that partially liquidate their holdings. I believe this will cause selling across the entire market when this happens. So some SPY puts placed a few weeks out might yield high profit when the squeeze happens as institutions sell to free up more capital. Just look at previous action on SPY as GME price rises dramatically. If you wanted to do some research you could probably find the bankruptcy candidates and their most held assets, and make some intelligent plays, but I’m already all in GME so I’m not going to bother.

So what I came here to ask tonight, is has anyone actually considered the long term effects of this beautiful thing that is happening??

Specifically for Gamestock itself. I can’t read, so I don’t know whether the company was in legitimate trouble as they were being valued as being in a death spiral.... but this has changed the game..

Can anyone pin down exactly how much free advertising they have/are getting? They are literally on the front page of newspapers, on every news station, people are buying damn BILLBOARDS for this!
All the while, they have yet they have yet to even make a statement... why would they? 

Can anyone put a value on they cost of capital for them right now? 

What if they decide to take a page straight out of the FUD playbook and fire that printing press up throwing out them new shares!? They could literally issue enough new shares and raise enough money at the current price to have taken themselves private at the previous valuation (250mil) while still not providing the shorts enough shares to cover. 

AND THEN WHAT!?  
With all this free cash and an unprecedented amount of free media they now have a chance to make BIG plays, inevitably raising their real intrinsic share value.... you know what happens then

So all of a sudden when their shares have a FAIR MARKET value of $150... with LUDICROUS amounts of media the FAIR MARKET value is no longer the MARKET VALUE, so shares now trade for $300 REAL MARKET VALUE

When was the last time you heard the word ""omnichannel""? LOL, it's probably only been like a week but damn, the last week has felt like it has taken years off of my life.

My question is this, should GME capitalize on the moment and issue shares to be able to truly set themselves up for the long term? Imagine if they issued enough shares to make a sizable acquisition like Steam? That would truly give them a serious foothold in the PC gaming industry.

Thoughts? 

Anyways, GME to the moon baby! Hold Hold Hold.

An Informative Fable,274,l93wlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93wlb/an_informative_fable/,84,1612094177.0,"ENDGAME:

As many newcomers to this subreddit are completely in the dark about strategy, I wanted to write a nice fable in order to better explain and motivate my new HOMO sapien brothers.

A purely fictional account potentially based on real-life occurrences;

**THE GORILLA ENDGAME**

Imagine a world in which we are a collective group of 100 Gorillas. We Gorillas hold a stockpile of 100 water bottles. We'll call it a ""Stock"" of water bottles. Water bottles that are essential to the survival of another species, we'll call them Homo-Faggy Monkeys (HFMs). There are \~150 HFMs, clearly not enough water bottles for each and every single one of them. These HFMs have run out of water, but yet don't want to pay the market price of our water bottles. 

In fact, they decided that they'll tell all the other Chimps, Neanderthals, Baboons, C-orangutans (CNBC) that they don't even need water anymore. They've evolved past the necessity of water (even though NO clear evidence on any water-tracking source can confirm this news).

Some Gorillas are a bit worried - if they don't need water, will I ever make a profit if I sell my water bottle? If I sell now, maybe I can secure my water bottle profit, and the last Gorilla with a water bottle might lose his initial money instead. This is exactly what the HFMs want, for the Gorillas to relinquish their supply of water bottles, based on a false narrative that the HFMs have disseminated.

However, if you look at the REAL matters of fact in this great Ape story, the rest of the water on the market is starting to dry up. The great watering holes - we'll call them SPY, DOWJ, and NSDQ for short - are starting to shrivel up. The HFMs are still consuming water! They HAVE NOT EVOLVED, and still are desperate for water. In fact, they're drinking MORE water trying to convince themselves (and the great Gorillas) that they don't need water!

Because here is the real alternative. At some point, the weaker HFMs will face an existential crisis. They NEED water. They cannot survive the cost of not having water for another day. Reluctantly, the weak and smaller HFMs must capitulate and purchase the first water bottle. Now, with less water bottles available (as the 1st weak HFM has consumed the first), the SECOND weakest HFM must purchase the 2nd water bottle at a higher price (more scarcity, and the price floor was set by the 1st HFM). The second HFM can't afford to survive without water any longer. One by one, the dominos fall. Each succeeding HFM must pay a higher and higher price. Finally, the LAST water bottle in the possession of the Gorillas is purchased at the HIGHEST price, because there is scarcity in water bottles, there are more HFMs in this water war than there are actual water bottles.

So you see, the longer the Gorillas can HOLD ONTO THE WATER BOTTLES, the higher the price the water bottles get. In fact, if the Gorillas hold onto the water bottles longer, the LAST Gorilla gets the most money, because the last HFM is existentially compelled to purchase it, at whatever price.

So you see, this is not a ponzi scheme of water bottles. You're not fighting other Gorillas over making the most profit on your water bottles. All Gorillas must know that there are more HFMs than Gorillas. They pay a price each and every day they don't have a water bottle. At some point, one weak HFM will have to buy at whatever price. Then all the HFMs will have to buy at whatever price. And the last Gorilla with the last water bottle gets the MOST money.

\---

If you enjoy my purely fictional story regarding Apes, please share so that the newer Apes in the subreddit understand the REAL picture. That Gorillas are under no threat if they do not sell their water bottles early. And in fact, the last Gorilla makes the most profit on their water bottles.

I'll spice up this story with some eye-catching emojis.

In 2018, a not so small foreign exchange company called Interactive Brokers was fined $5.5 million for their involvement in the naked short selling of stocks *thousands* of times. They are a company with a market cap of $26.2 billion. **That is nothing for a company their size.**

&#x200B;

Or, look at JPMorgan. They have a market cap of $392 billion. They were fined $920 million last year for price manipulation. **That is nothing for a company their size.**

&#x200B;

So far, Melvin and others have lost billions on their short positions, and could loose an ungodly amount more if/when the squeeze comes.

&#x200B;

So if you don't think that they would risk millions in fees to prevent **billions** in losses, then you must be joking.

&#x200B;

**This is why it is so important that we HOLD and do not buy into their tactics.**

&#x200B;

* No matter how far it falls, do not sell, as it is them manipulating the price.
* Don't trust the media on this. They have just as much riding on this as Melvin.
* Use Fidelity or Vanguard. Robinhood and others WILL screw you when things get rough for Melvin.

(Edit: My statement of ""Don't use robinhood"" seems to have mislead some people. If you own stock on Robinhood, hold it. Do not transfer either. However if you want to buy more, the best thing to do is use another broker.)

GME valuation,149,l93lbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93lbz/gme_valuation/,65,1612093140.0,"After a month of rising and a week of mooning, GME trades at $300 and a market cap of 22 billion. And it's fairly valued. Gamestop consistently brings in [revenue of around 8 billion per year](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue). And even with all the pandemic shutdowns it brought in 6 billion in 2020. Fair market value should at least be $100 a share at 8 billion. If it seems high now, it's only because it was massively undervalued before.

Now we're coming out of the pandemic. Gamestop has new leadership. The whole world is watching and millions of retards are buying in anger. And it's only at $300 after multiple counts of manipulation and shorting. Gamestop has plenty more potential to run. It can pivot to new online business models. Revenue should be much higher due to re opening and essentially free advertising and news coverage. People will continue to buy and hold.

There's no reason GME can't display the same price movement as TSLA, which went up and up, and if it didn't go up  it stayed sideways. The shorts lost on TSLA and they will lose here. Don't try to anticipate the GME crash because if we all hold strong there simply won't be one.

TLDR
🚀🚀🚀🚀GME but will lead to 📉📉📉rest of market 

Most hedge funds take full advantage of the leverage allowances given to them by federal regulators. Current regulation allows them to be up to 30x leveraged as long as their overall position is net neutral. This means for very $1 in their fund they can be $15 short and $15 long because the leverage is assumed to be canceled out back to zero since the fund is equally long/short, hence: net neutral. 

So, the following is what happens when you get a black swan event where mania is rampant in the markets in the form of a large number of investors actively trying to squeeze stocks with high short floats:

It's important to understand that most of the time, the stocks with the highest floats have high short floats because it's where the smart money is collectively shorting. There are currently ~20 companies with short floats comprising 35% or more of outstanding shares.

When hedge funds and RIAs who are net neutral but fully leveraged, see a ton of their shorts being threatened by a potential squeeze, they logically decide to close some of their short positions to prevent heavy, cascading losses.

What happens next? Hedge Fund A has $1b of real, non-levered, capital. They took on $30b of leverage and shorted $15b worth of companies while longing $15b worth of companies, an equal ratio because, by law, they have to remain net neutral if they take on leverage. So, Hedge Fund A decides to de-risk in the face of this black swan event threatening all of its shorts at once by closing, let's say 30% of their short position, so $5b. Now they’re $10b short and $15b long on $1b worth of real, non-levered capital. In order to comply with regulation they now have to cut $5b of their long position as well. What do they sell? Outperforming blue chips that are heavily liquid like Tesla which is up over 1000% since January 2020 and other names like it that are also up 10-30% in 2021 alone seem like a good place to book profits. So broader market indices start to feel the pain.

I think for this reason, if the wsb short squeeze trend of buying heavy short floated stocks continues, we’ll likely see markets pullback in February as most of the speculative retail money gets deployed. This isn’t the way people thought we’d see a 10-15% pullback in the markets, but a correction was probably needed, and this is one way of how it might manifest. 

So when Feb comes as long as no negative covid/vaccine news comes out, make sure to have some cash on the side so you can BTFD. /end rant

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

WORDS:

We flew past it so quickly that I even managed to sell myself a meme-orable fill as I was taking profits. 🧻🖐🤦🏻‍♂️ compared to the immaculate /u/DeepFuckingValue—he has only trimmed while I am \~95% out. I will sell CSPs over the next weeks at prices I’m happy to invest at for the long term after the speculative mania subsides. I have 300 Spartan shares still standing tall at this point and wish for us to see true Valhalla—another sell at $690.69...and beyond. This is my goal now. One thing I always pride myself on is being transparent and honest. I want you all to know I took life changing profits—at least my paper and crayons taste good.

GME Week of Feb 1 Strategy,0,l939n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l939n1/gme_week_of_feb_1_strategy/,160,1612092077.0,"I got in on this party quite late; initially watching from the sidelines. On Thursday, when all the Robinhood chaos unfolded and the price artificially plummeted, I saw the opportunity to jump in and picked up a single, Feb 19th $320 call.

**Come Monday, I'm prepared to buy up to $100k+ worth of stock and/or options.** However, I first want to explore a couple of various scenarios that we may see play out and think through the potential effects with you guys ... no matter how unlikely they are. I'll try to be succinct.

# Scenario 1: issuance of new blocks of stock at ~market value

**EDIT: THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE ( I was not aware )**

&#x200B;

~~If I'm not mistaken, Q1 for Gamestop begins Feb 1. Say they want to capitalize on everything by essentially, sending a bailout package to hedge funds - the very ones responsible for shorting them in the first place. This would be in an effort to shore up their finances and provide them enough capital to easily explore ways to adapt their business. Likely, this would come with strings attached. e.g. Hedge funds receiving new shares cannot sell for n years.~~

**~~Potential Outcomes:~~**

1. ~~HFs close out their short positions and short interest plummets. No more squeeze looks promising because the only shorts remaining would be those which shorted in the $300+ range. 💎🙌 don't have a strong incentive to hold, nor try to compete against these remaining shorts. Retail selling begins.~~
2. ~~?~~

# Scenario 2: short interest isn't all telling

We are all aware that short interest is extremely high - quite likely still over 100%. However, with the recent blast of all media coverage from *reputable* networks, all are claiming Melvin, Citron, and Muddy Waters have all closed their short positions. I find this hard to believe and suspect. Sounds like a shitty PR campaign and obvious plea/attempt to instill fear.

Let's just assume that these reports are true. We can then infer that this extremely high short interest is more likely held near the $77, $160, $380 - $483 levels (just taking daily highs).

If that's the case, for the sake of argument, let's assume the $77 shorts have closed their positions - helping drive the price up to the next levels.

**Potential Impact:**

1. Short interest remains extremely high, but the current market value ($325) is not enough pressure to initiate a squeeze - assuming these firms have enough capital to not be in danger of a margin call. Or, perhaps those that are in trouble, have decided to sell off other positions in the market to remain in good standing - hence the overall market decline this week.
2. ?

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. &#x200B;
   1. 💎🙌stay impenetrable. However, it becomes an extremely long dragged out war until they get tired of paying the short interest fees which are insanely high - especially for new shorts.
   2. 💎🙌 turn paper. Without deep pockets, we would need continued institutional longs to help push this into a squeeze.

&#x200B;

There are plenty of holes in each scenario on why it's so unlikely or not possible. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well.

This is a thread about educating each other on what your opponent could do  to fuck you over.

I see so many people saying price targets of $GME to $1,000, $10,000, $50,000... as if buying back the shares they shorted is your opponent’s only option... Is it REALLY their only option? Everyone who believes that without questioning other tactics is really underestimating Wall Street.

————————————

I’ll start with this question. Who did the shorts borrow shares from? Do those people care about getting their shares returned or do they just care about cash and their agreed upon interest rate? 

If that’s the case, what stops a short seller from making a side deal with them that says 

“recovering your shares is a lost cause, here is a lump sum. Your shares are no longer borrowed, they’ve been sold. This is a better deal for you and me because if we fail, you won’t get paid”

"Can Robinhood prevent selling at their discretion? Can they experience ""technical difficulties"" when someone might want to sell?",191,l9314h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9314h/can_robinhood_prevent_selling_at_their_discretion/,236,1612091309.0,"Hypothetically let's say the the squeeze truly does squoze during the next couple of weeks and we're all sipping fresh GME juice aboard our moon rocket. RH clearly doesn't want the retail sector coming out ahead here. If GME were to hit 5k a share or whatever, could they just disable selling? Or could they ""go down"" for a day at peak times?

Is there any recourse for someone who might want to sell but can't due to app/website errors? If I try to initiate a sell at X time, but it doesn't go through because of problems on their end, is there any way I can prove that and force them to sell at the amount I asked for, or am I SOL?

I'm not just asking for myself, I'm asking for the probably hundreds of thousands of us sitting with shares in RH who can't move to Fidelity or another broker because the securities transfer would take too long. We have no choice but to hold out hope that if the iron gets hot, we'll be allowed to strike.

For the record, I plan on holding until at least 10k, and depending on how the next couple of weeks go that might be increasing substantially. I just want to know that I can GET the fair price for my stocks if I do sell and that RH isn't going to fuck me over and then play the ""whoopsie, network error!"" card. 

I mean people could sue for such an event, right?

Edit: I think we need a plan for people in such a situation. If enough people are screen recording, showing the precise moment they were trying to buy or sell and exactly what happened, and then getting together and amassing a huge amount of proof, RH is going to have to capitulate. Maybe we should make a sub just in anticipation of this kind of problem. I'm not even joking, I think it would be useful. We have the right to sell our stocks and participate in the market. If they interfere with that we need to be able to show it.

Edit 2: I completely agree about getting out of RH as soon as possible. They're a garbage service. The issue is that if I move my shares now to another broker, that could take weeks and in the meantime I would be locked out of making any moves. Same goes for everyone else in this position.

Edit 3: It seems the consensus is that RH can absolutely do this and then make you say ""thank you, daddy"" after fucking you sideways with no lube.

**Final edit**: Okay, well, regardless of how things shake out with RH, I'm here because **I like the stock** and I plan to hold.

It's just math.  The hedgies are fucked.  We sit on our shares, and they bleed.  Not blood of course, but the only thing they care about.

Money.

We're hitting em in the only place they care about - their wallets.  We're actually getting our chance.  To get back some of the money that they soaked up for destroying the economy in 2008.  To get out of debt.  To pay the bills.  To buy a house.  To pay for the treatment. To have a retirement.

This is the first hopeful, dare I say optimistic time in many of our lives.  Not only at the prospect of making some perhaps life changing money, nor only to put the screws to the elites that fuck us over without a second thought.  But at how unifying this experience has been.  I feel a bond with each of you, for holding strong through the ups and downs, and diamond handing with ice in your veins and steel in your glare.  Memes are on point too.

There was no massive selloff.  The volume was low.  We made it through this last week.  We can make it through this next one. And on for however long the shorts would like to continue bleeding.

We *will* have our infinite squeeze.

We all are seeing a ton of posts and comments right now stating the absolute worst case scenarios as fact in regards to Robinhood. 
  
They are exercising cash positions as margin.  
They are locking your accounts due to owing less than a dollar.  
They will be bankrupt by Monday morning.  
Etc, etc, etc.  
  
Numerous users stating others need to transfer assets and positions out of RH asap.  
Numerous users stating others need to just sell and reinvest with other brokers.  
Numerous users stating others need to sell before trading is halted for 30 days, or RH goes under and locks your shares, costing you potentially hundreds of thousands, or millions.  
  
First, nobody here can give YOU financial advice. That is not who, or what, WSB is about. Do your own research based off of what you read here, THEN make an educated decision with YOUR money.  
  
Second, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS check the comment and post history, INCLUDING CONTENT, NOT JUST KARMA, of anyone posting something that may make you worry about your positions, or your brokerage.  
  
This sub has grown exponentially (that means bigger, for you retards) in a VERY small amount of time. We have new members. Extremely vulnerable and inexperienced investors/gamblers. You are who I am directing this to.  
  
This is a war of Hedge Funds versus individual investors. There are no rules in war, as we are seeing. If they need to make accounts here to scare people into selling, they will.  
  
They are.  
  
Again, neither myself, nor any other fucking retard here, can give anyone advice as to what to do.

**OBLIGATORY - $GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS).**

It’s ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, because what I’m about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **“squeeze opportunity”.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people’s lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn’t need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day 🙃) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out “Citadel Connect” - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood —> Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name... hmmm weird, but I can’t seem to find any relation on good old Google! So we’ll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrock’s silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. How’d they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morgan’s history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes “viral” and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the “next squeeze”, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood —> Citadel —> JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you’re doing. Our mission is to focus on 💎🤲🏻ing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood. Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.

I've heard a lot of talk about people saying ""It's not about the money"" in regards to $GME but I feel that misses the practical mark.  Do any of you ever want to be able to make money on stocks ever again? Because of the possibility of the little guy coming out a little ahead on one stock, Robinhood has trading restrictions on 50 stocks now: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html

This is absurd, this is manipulation of all sorts of companies that have gone in and out of WSB popularity over the years.  For instance, they don't want you buying $AMD after they just killed it at earnings?  Their PE is only 41, that's nothing compared to the ~180 it was back in June of 2019.  It's a much safer bet now, risk wise.  They're doing this to put us all in our place.

I thought I'd outsmart everyone else here and buy into $NOK before it took off, well now $NOK is restricted too.  And you know what?  I'm never going to make a dime on it if $GME doesn't succeed.  It has occurred to me if I ever want to see a return ever again, I need to buy some $GME at market open monday. And I might never be able to sell.  Because once we start selling, the price will go down fast and the shorts will win.  So the only way to win is to never sell.  If we win, we'll bleed them dry and they'll think twice before trying to screw us again.  The only way to win is to buy $GME and never sell.

GME and the prisoner's dilemma,338,l92jzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l92jzg/gme_and_the_prisoners_dilemma/,140,1612089786.0,"**Introduction**

If you have not heard of the prisoner's dilemma, here is a quick rundown. 

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison

If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison

If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in 
prison and B will be set free

If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

In our case snitching is selling, and holding is remaining silent. And the jail sentence is ""losing your money"", so by selling you won't ""lose"".

As you can see in the prisoner's dilemma it is most logical that the two gang members will snitch on each other in order to look out for themselves - even though it is the worst decision. The thing is in reality however, humans have shown a great deal of co-operation.

The reality is that people will hold, and by not holding you ultimately fuck yourself over as well as the rest of everyone else. So while it might seem rational selling, the truth is it is more rational holding.

The media and most of you retards are getting 2 things wrong,202,l92dpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l92dpk/the_media_and_most_of_you_retards_are_getting_2/,220,1612089212.0,"1) This is mostly the media, but some retards here are guilty too.

GME is not the joke. In fact, GME is the only *sane* thing in the market now. The strategy is not based on the fundamentals, *which is the whole fucking point*. These hedgefunds are so confident that they can manipulate the price of the stock that they are *massively over risked*. GME is not a joke, the idea that the market is fair or that it is measuring actual value is the joke and the autists here are proving it.

2) Robinhood isn't exactly the bad guy. Run by a pussy maybe, but probably not corrupt. The brokers and clearing houses have a legal obligation to be able to clear trades for their clients. If they can't, they need to take action. No one can get *actual shares* of GME right now, which is the effect of the strategy. The hedgefunds need to buy it and they can't, which is exactly the effect we are hoping for. No one can, which is why if Robinhood wanted to buy GME for it's customer they'd need to have 100% of the value at the broker/clearing house. This means they COULD get it, but they literally need to send trucks of cash to the clearing house before they could do so, this takes time and the CEO of Robinhood is obviously a pussy and thinks that bringing the market to the people is about making the buy button prettier and not about flexing the muscle of 1M users. His actual job should be to get a line of credit from a bank that's across the street from the clearing house or w/e. I don't know the actual details because I don't work in the industry, but anyone should be able to figure this out after a few hours of reading threads here over the past few days. If anyone can get GME right now it's because their broker is taking some risk of they have a line of credit with the broker. Robinhood simply isn't willing to take a *risk* on your behalf, which is very different from them simply blocking your buy button on behalf of some backroom handshake deal.

Edit: Let me make this very simple for all you extra special retards: you can't buy something that no one is selling. Neither can Robinhood, neither can their broker, neither can their clearing house(whether that's Robinhood themselves, DST, or anyone else). I agree that Vlad is a moron and a pussy. The Hedgefunds can't get stock, this is what we want. If we effect a strategy where-in Hedgefunds can't get the stock, do you really think Vlad is going to be able to get it? Vlad is just the king-retard of the retards that think that buying a stock is as complicated as clicking the big green buy button.",2021-01-31 12:33:32

I have worked in propaganda prevention, phishing, technical control implementation, and cyber-warfare capacities. Some of you are retarded, if not most of you. So I have written this guide to help you understand the tools, tactics, and procedures used by nation-states, organised crime, and bad actors to persuade people to take actions outside of their own best interests!

EDIT ***TLDR: Don't trust anything you read on this site, feel free to not trust my content too!***

At this stage, you are seeing a combination of all three techniques being used by a combination of nation states and financial sector bad actors. Spend five minutes looking into US foreign relations if you want to understand why nation states are interested in manipulating the outcome of this short squeeze.

1. Obfuscation is the action of making something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.
2. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is communicated regardless of an intention to deceive.
3. Propaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.

Anyway, here are some things to look out for, a **TLDR at the end will help you understand your best defensive measures available**.

# Creating Noise

We are seeing a significant uptick in bot traffic to Reddit, Twitter, and other social media. This appears in all data really, especially trading data. Adversaries like to create noise to make it difficult to get truly valuable information for a standard user. We are seeing 7 million members in WallStreetBets. At this stage, it is very likely that over a million of those accounts are involved in propaganda.

While our moderators have some success with using automated moderation to remove low-karma or low-age accounts, any sensible blackhat offensive security outfit would have created thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of accounts pre-emptively over time. Alternatively, they would have a suite of compromised reddit accounts ready for use. If you share your password across multiple websites, there is a great chance you have at least been involved in a data-breach and had some of your accounts stealth-stolen.

With a lot of accounts available, you can then set them up to either automatically post content either calling Reddit API's (Captcha doesn't do shit, check appsec california 2019) or you can use something like mechanical turk service to pay literal peanuts to poor people to do menial tasks. So, expect that a lot of activity in this sub-reddit, on twitter, and on other social media is coming from non-reputable sources and designed to mislead you.

# Excessive Information

Detailed analysis, legalese, or complicated sentences are a fantastic way to mislead people. Consider what the average person is, and then remember 50% of the population are stupider than them. A lot of narrative strength and credibility comes simply from using language that is difficult to parse or comprehend for the average person. If you see posts that are using very technical language, remember that either the person has no idea how to communicate, or they are very intentional with how they are communicating.

# Internal Jargon Builds Trust

By using jargon and language that is familiar to people, you are in a position of trust. As an adversary, I would always do reconnaisance ahead of time to understand the culture of the organisation I am targetting. Once you have the internal language mastered, you can build credibility with your sentences. Apes be strong, Retard Strength, Guh, whatever. This is a public forum, it will be easy for an adversary to gain trust and credibility from using our language.

# Expert Analysis vs Crowdsourced Expertise

Nowadays, humans are migrating away from expert PoV's towards crowd-sourced or community views. This has some positives, sometimes experts get it wrong especially in the field of economics and finance. Secondly, like getting a second opinion from a doctor, you're able to get a seemingly broader perspective about what is good.

The problem with this is that you cannot always rely on crowd-sourced expertise, and academic standards often have very rigorous procedures involved. Now, in this situation, you can't rely on a uni whitepaper. This is fairly unprecedented. But you shouldn't entirely discount the opinions of experts in the media at the same time.

# Qualitative vs Quantitive Data

As humans, we tend to easily believe Quantitive Data over Qualitative. Numbers, Math, Statistics, Charts, they all require significantly more effort to disprove than to create. Because of this lopsided nature, they're used a lot fo misinform and manipulate opinion. Especially concerning is that most individuals do not feel qualified to question empirical data.  When looking at chart data, try to independently verify its factual correctness using other sources of information. Also, try to recognise what the agenda behind the creator of the chart is. What are they trying to achieve?

# Summing up or TLDR

* There is a significant increase in content attributable to both new-users, bad actors, and bots. There is a lot of copy-pasting, a lot of meme'ing, and also a lot of bullshit. Don't get stressed by the sheer amount of content available now and take everything you read with an open mind that it may not be written in your best interest.
* There will be a lot of new technical posts trying to explain the situation. Remember that most retards can't comprehend anything like that. Good Autists can choose to write in a non-technical way to help us apes. Bad actors will intentionally choose difficult language to build credibility. Question things that aren't written in CLEAR and SIMPLE language.
* You can't do much about hiding our cultural language, everybody knows it now. Just remember that there are some novice adversaries who will be 'fellow school kids' and not do their reconnaisance. Also remember that you will feel more trusting of users who use this language, and pull that emotion back.
* While mainstream media is looking into manipulating content for their hedge-fund masters, remember that there are still academics and other independent experts who can provide good analysis. Reddit is good for crowd-sourcing expertise, but don't forget that independent academics exist too who are, arguably, more difficult to manipulate.
* Don't trust charts, statistics, or anything numerical at face value. This content is chosen because it is difficult and time-consuming to disprove, and provided legitimacy and credibility to the author with low effort. If you lack expertise in that area, consider the chart or opinion to be misleading by default AND then independently verify using other sources of information. Also, try to recognise what the agenda behind the chart is.

Customer-Centric Fundamental Analysis of $AMC,190,l9246n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9246n/customercentric_fundamental_analysis_of_amc/,182,1612088366.0,"$GME featured later in the post, too. 🚀🚀

Sorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash. Trust me. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

​
I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.
​
Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:
​
* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B
​

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.
​

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.
​

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).
​

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.
​

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  
​
​

**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**
​

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.
​

**The shifting sentiment from ""Netflix and Chill"" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**
​

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] ""Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?""
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.
​

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   

Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  
​
​
* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. 
   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc. 

​
**Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. 

​
*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares


*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares

​
*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million 

​
On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 
​


Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

​
In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 
​
Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

​
*Positions*

​
shares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while

​
options: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.
​
​
On WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.
​

Edit: I will set a limit order of 100 to expire in 90 days, the brokerage cannot sell my shares. If I still don’t want to sell at that price and it gets close, just add another $100. I will never sell, but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value.

Posting this article here as it seems like information worth digesting prior to the Robinhood mass exodus. Not advocating one way or the other, simply interested in the truth. To those of you that actually know... is this true? Article below:

A little-known intermediary in the process of buying and selling equities forced Robinhood and other brokers to restrict trading in several securities on Thursday, including GameStop , AMC Entertainment , BlackBerry , and Nokia . All have been swept up in the WallStreetBets-fueled short-squeeze phenomenon and have seen intense volatility in recent days.

Theories abounded online about Robinhood—a mobile-first, low-cost brokerage founded on the idea of expanding access to trading to more people—being in league with the “men in suits” at hedge funds on the losing side of those trades. Politicians on Twitter from across the political spectrum condemned the broker’s move. But Robinhood’s provided reason that it needed to restrict trading in those stocks until it could increase its collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, holds water.

Explaining that requires getting into a bit of market plumbing and elements of the trading process that usually don’t get much attention.

When an investor orders their broker—Robinhood or E*Trade, for example—to buy or sell a security, the broker accepts the trade and sends it to an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The exchange then matches buyers with sellers, and from the investor’s perspective, the transaction is as good as done. But there are still some mechanics that need to be worked out behind the scenes.

Investors may have noticed that the cash proceeds from selling a stock aren’t immediately available to withdraw from their account after a trade is completed—that usually takes a business day or two. Back in the day, that time was spent physically exchanging stock certificates between brokers. Today’s trading volumes make that an impossible task.

Today, after a stock exchange completes a trade, it sends the information to the DTCC, which keeps track of brokers’ books. The DTCC is a clearing house, an important part of the financial system. Clearing houses not only process and complete trades in an efficient manner, they help limit systemic risk. The clearing house promises to make good on all trades that happen regardless of what happens to an individual broker.

The DTCC is responsible for transferring ownership of the stock from the seller’s broker to the buyer’s broker—and vice versa for the cash involved. Rather than doing that after every single one of the trillions of dollars of trades each day, the DTCC waits until it can net several trades into “one position per security, per client, per settlement date,” according to its website. The settlement date is the day when the cash and securities involved in a trade actually change hands.

At the settlement date, which falls two days after the investor places their trade, the seller’s broker must deliver the stock being sold and the buyer’s broker must provide the cash. The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It’s like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman’s risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC’s collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares’ notional value, volatility, and other variables.

For a relatively risk-free transaction—in liquid, less volatile stocks like, say, Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT)—that collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC’s formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That’s because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that’s worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can’t complete the transaction.

When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there’s a large imbalance between a broker’s buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn’t net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn’t want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.

Since then, the brokerage has drawn down its credit lines at several banks and brought in $1 billion from existing investors to fund additional collateral requirements. On Friday, Robinhood reopened buying of Gamestop and other recently popular stocks.

The DTCC says it processes trillions of dollars of transactions a day, including equities, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. It said that collateral requirements for all of its broker clients were $33.5 billion on Thursday, up from $26 billion the day before.

Their total cash is puny, and **most of it is segregated under federal regulations**. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. This is why they keep halting buying, because they simply can't handle further buying power.

There is a significant chance that had they not halted trading on the relevant stocks the day of the fiasco, they would've been **insolvent** by close of trading. **This is why they raised $1 billion as an emergency from investors.**

My Wild Ass Guess at How GME Plays Out,120,l91sna,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l91sna/my_wild_ass_guess_at_how_gme_plays_out/,192,1612087333.0,"This isn't financial advise as I am not a financial advisor.  I'm concerned that the strong will that exists may be less strong if there is not immediate gratification for retail shareholders, particularly those who bought in over 90 and who could see big swings before the trip to Valhalla. Just putting a few things out there so all us smooth brains have time to digest the possibilities.   

Edit: to be clear. Don’t spend what you can’t afford to lose. I am not saying to to buy options. I’m saying that the lack of this happening this week may cause the price to drop so your smooth brain better be ready for the ride. 


TLDR: Best case scenario is retail investors buying far OTM options and letting large whales support the price on the way up. This is unlikely because premiums are jacked to the tits making them too expensive for retail. ITM options that are NOT exercises don't help the cause but new ITM options are too expensive to exercise for you and your wife's boyfriend. Early diamond hands win long term but not before most of your friends turn into paper handed pussi bois.  A trip to Valhalla could actually crash the market to make sure you don't lose your GME tendies on other plays. 

I have read a lot of mixed guesses at how this plays out and I want to get a read on what the hive mind thinks. 

**Infinite Squeeze = Three Concurrent Squeezes**

There are three squeezes going on

1. The squeeze from retailer buyers piling into a stock thinking it is a ticket to Valhalla

2. The gamma squeeze from  far OTM options contracts going ITM

3. The actual short squeeze

*1 & 2 are happening. 3 is not happening as new shorts have replaced old shorts.*

So a thesis need to be made on each individual squeeze and on the macro scenario.

**Immediate Term Retail Squeeze**

1. Immediate term I don’t see retail stopping. People will inevitably make bad decisions and continue to pile into the stock at almost any price. This has turned into a worldwide phenom so it’s not just US investors. The entire world is getting in on the action.

**Gamma Squeeze**

2. The most complicated of the bunch. IMO the price rise we have seen is ONLY from #1 & #2 so far and mostly from #2. The question here is WILL IT CONTINUE? …. I’m not sure.

This is the area where the hedge funds have the most knowledge and the most control over pricing. That said, it’s not just the shorts at this point. Multiple hedge funds have jumped in on both sides of the trade. This means it’s billionaire vs billionaire. IMO retail will have NO IMPACT in this area because this is totally dependent on buying OTM options contracts EN MASSE that go ITM causing MM to buy shares to cover.

This ALMOST caused the real squeeze on Thursday before retail buying was cut off. The reason it could have happened last week but not in the future is because the high from the option chain a week ago was 60 & the high from the option chain yesterday was averaging out \~320 (they added new highs everyday last week)  which is why we saw such a battle at the 320 price on Friday close.

For the gamma squeeze to continue the price MUST go up. BIGLY. As far into the extreme OTM options (too highly priced for retail) as possible. IF it happens it could trigger the real squeeze. I think this is the angle long hedge positions are attempting. Buy OTM calls, drive price up on low volume, exercise shares (again, retail can’t do this because 320 \* 100 = 32k) and then hold shares for squeeze #3

**The Trip to Valhalla**

3. It will happen at some point but no one knows when that point will be. It very well could be a year from now or it could be Monday. The longer it goes on the more chance there is for something to happen that would eliminate it from happening.

&#x200B;

**How Much is Actually Short**

The common knowledge says GME is \~130% short sold, but I’m going to consider the hedge funds more sophisticated than that and assume that positions like synthetic longs and other hedges we are not aware of are in play, driving down “real” short to something extreme but not totally unwindable for the shorts if they get lucky.

So, something like this could happen....

Assume a squeeze could be prevented at 20% less short than wherever we are currently. What if GME issues that much in new shares? The get gobbled up by shorts, not eliminating their upcoming ass fucking by delaying it long enough that retail interest fades. 

Or… the SEC steps in. The NYSE delists GME for ""fraud"".  Or some other existential  threat comes into play.

So… the question is… will these squeezes happen.

Best case scenario is that #1 or #2 work and #3 is triggered. This is the “infinite squeeze”.

If that happens many millionaires are minted. 

BUT… that seems unlikely meaning what else could happen… what is “likely”?

Here a take… hedge funds attempt #2. It doesn’t work because long options are so expensive, high volatility etc &  GME shorts have enough capital to keep fucking with price action (easier to do with low volume) and retail taps out on buying options because they are expensive. 

At the same time, retail continues to pile into shares (options are too expensive). When hedge longs fail the price drops as MM can unwind their extreme positions. Retail shits their pants & sells. **This isn’t out of the question as retail was already a net seller last week**. That's right, there are paper hands among us!

The price goes right back down to 40, anyone who wasn't in at a low cost basis (ie most people) sell shares,  GME shorts profit off hedge positions on the way up & down giving them enough capital to fight another day. GME does a stock issuance, putting more shares into the market. #3 is still on the table but the timeline moves from days to months giving shorts a long runway to unwind and a perfect (highly volatile) environment to play both sides against the middle to be net neutral or within a tolerable margin of loss on their original position.

So we are left with… short term #1 pushes #2 into happening (with assistance of long hedge help) which pushes #3 into happening or … paper hands shake out everyone but the earliest entrants. 

**WHAT WOULD HELP**

Retail buying OTM options helps but it REALLY helps if they can exercise the option. This takes a lot of cash. Most won't be able to. 

Good = options moving ITM. Price moving higher. Bad = Highest concentration of options expiring next Friday doesn’t happen retail thinks things are moving too slow & paper hands. 

Best thing that could happen is retail continues to buy far OTM options along with long hedge support of price which spikes price soon.   


**WHAT MIGHT HURT**

If the trip to Valhalla actually takes off we may get rich but the big boys are going to be selling off other stocks like crazy. There is a real liquidity issue in the market right now  ( you saw it this week with the brokerage/clearinghouse fuckups) and historically, systemic liquidity issues lock up the market and real crashes happen. So... if #3 happens, pay attention to your other positions and consider hedging your wins! Again, not financial advice.

In 2021, u/deepfuckingvalue and u/Jeffamazon, lead the charge against some of the largest Hedge Funds in the US financial system, including Citadel and Robinhood, trying to infiltrate and destroy the most retarded short position in US finance history.

Did you know, you would be paying back Americans and retards across the world for what happened to them, their families, and their girlfriend’s boyfriends during the 2008 financial crisis.

We can’t thank you enough.

Now some context:

From February 2006 through January 2014, Bernanke was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, having been appointed to that position by both Presidents Bush and Obama. Before his appointment as chairman, Dr. Bernanke was chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, from June 2005 to January 2006. He was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005.

Bernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama.

Bernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the 2008 financial crisis. According to The New York Times, Bernanke ""has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.""

Bernanke has also been criticized for his actions in the merging of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.  In a 2009 letter to Congress, Andrew Cuomo mentioned Bernanke along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by BoA. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson.

When Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the ""Materially Adverse Change"" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.

To wrap everything up, I could write a well thought out conclusion tying Bernanke to fraud and being a co-conspirator in the Robinhood/Citadel liquidity crisis but if you can’t connect the dots fuck you because you should’ve stopped your uncle from reading this to you 15 minutes ago.

"Suporting the case for SLV with a chart, historical data and a retard with Microsoft paint",2,l91lp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l91lp8/suporting_the_case_for_slv_with_a_chart/,91,1612086707.0,"So I've read quite a few good DD's on silver lately and I've been really into charts today so I decided to see if I could find any sort of patern or anything really. What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen

Idk if you all have felt the same vibe I have been getting from people, but many people have been saying that this run-up is:

""unsustainable;"" ""GME is going to Crash Hard;"" and **my most favorite ""IT'S A FUCKING BUBBLE""**

WELL, MY ANSWER TO ALL THE FRINGES OUT THERE IS TO **PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS!** Take a look at the option chain I provided below:

[GME 2year LEAPs ](https://preview.redd.it/om5j2jtqjke61.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b9c9dfbf7f8a666f27e558de4a9981bb7ffa78)

As you can see here, the bid-ask spread is trading fairly within a \~$15 range with bids ranging from $191 to $175 **on a fucking 2year contract!** I say that is highly significant given the fact that these Financial Institutions were literally betting GME would go to ZERO like yesterday. As you can see by simply looking at the contact pricing, it is trading as if it's here to stay for the foreseeable future.

**So, if there is anyone doubting your assumptions and namesake, simply tell them ""well there's a shit-ton of money to be made betting against me.""**  By selling the Calls anywhere from about the 350 strikes to about the 400 strikes, they could collect upwards of $18000 per 1 lot. Anyways, there is serious money to be made. Yet, it would be so satisfying to see the contrarians be left forced to buy shares of a company that believed it had the same worth as the lady who gives blowies behind the Wendy's dumpster.

**TL/DR:** GME 2year LEAPs have some sick premium, so tell whoever is gay to go sell Calls and watch them burn.

Positions: *No current open positions in GME,* Have a couple of SLV Bull-call Spreads.

A question about reinvesting into $GME,24,l910jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l910jn/a_question_about_reinvesting_into_gme/,21,1612084891.0,"My earlier post was deleted i dont know why mods PLZ dm me to explain why if i did something wrong

First off i have absolutley have no financial experience what so ever, hell i only joined WSB this week and i have already have fallen in love with this community.

So we all know what might happen if the true squeeze occurs and what will happen after it, my question would be: wouldn't it be a smart idea to reinvest some if the gains into GME in the post squeeze super dip that i would imagine is coming?

From what i have learned doing some DD on this subreddit and its this:

*  Gamestop was doing ok, not great, before covid. 
* The company got some investment from Ryan Cohen who even was given a board seat as well as 2 friends from Chewy. They plan to move the company away from brick and mortar stores and turn Gamestop into an online store like steam i guess. 
* There is a new console generation where the supply is so low that PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING OVER PS5s at stores.
* All the media attention has brought Gamestop to the forefront of almost everyones mind even those who dont play video games in the US  and has for most part for most people put the company in an extremely positive light as the underdog.

As far as ive heard the rumor is Gamestop had serious issues raising captial due to number of reasons (mostly being over shorted and covid hiting a b&m store i bet) but now due to the short squeeze and it taking over every tv in the world. I wouldnt be surprised if more investors came in to help Gamestop after the dust settles. 

My thoughts would be after short squeeze happened those of us who sell $GME it would be a smart move to rebuy $GME and 💎👐 once again.

Ill say it again i have NO FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE and this is nothing more than an educated guess.

Love to hear the opinions of it who at least have some wrinkles in their smooth brains

Here is all you are doing by continuing to double down on stuff like this and 'diamond handing'. **You are buying someone else's risk and letting them cash out and go home.** You are being left with the bag, when GME and all the other memes collapse, and will wonder what you did wrong (probably blaming the market).

They know this and will try to absolutely run us dry until we are forced to sell. These are hedge funds we are talking about they have impoverished others before and they will try to do the same again if it benefits them.

GME devil's advocate,0,l90vcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l90vcc/gme_devils_advocate/,147,1612084438.0,"Alright, this is going to be brutal on karma. I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it.

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

I work in tech now and I have an MBA, and oddly before this week I would never thought to pitch to Gamestop, but I love the idea of pitching Gamestop.

Why? Gamestop was a portal to reach totally random kids who loved everything I did. We used to all harass our parents to take us to two places: local LAN party joints or Gamestop. We didn't have any money, it was essentially a dumping ground for poor kids, but we'd be respectful of both businesses. Yeah you could meet strangers online, but that's weird (or weirder now than it was then) and I am STILL friends with people I met at LAN parties and Gamestop.

There's a lot of potential for physical retail spaces and there's time during Covid19 to transform those before we reopen this bitch with a brand new $20B Gamestop in 2021/2022.

Could we remake LAN parties, arcades, all the grimey old 80's spaces that slowly were demolished through the late 90's? The lifeblood of America? Yes we brought gaming ""home,"" and sold more consumer devices, but we lost the in-person human experience. Can we write Gamestop into Stranger Things and every other TV/movie coming out in the next two years to boost the hype train? Yes.

What if the game/console sales went the Chewy model (with local pickup if shipping to a residence isn't possible) and the new albeit small retail space was used for game, console, but also STEM/educational programming, bring Black Girls Code in and be inclusive, gamers aren't all blond white boys. My nieces and nephews don't want, despite all my efforts, to play just Warhammer 40k as the Trukk Boyz. My favorite niece does and growls ""WAAAGHHHHH"" but her sister plays Minecraft.

My friends who are parents, even if they were or are gamers and nerds, are confused about what content is safe for their kids these days. When Among Us came out my sister asked if it was safe for kids.. and I didn't know to be honest. We grew up on Gamestop.. why not have it shepherd the next generation of entertainment through diverse programming and informing parents. Subscribe to Gamestop basic for a newsletter about family friendly games and activities you can play with multiple generations, kids and parents, just kids, just parents, etc. Hype games like Jackbox, not just Cyberpunk.

You know what everyone pitches and hates pitching? Social media. Social media got too broad, it needs some structure, can we revisit a cross between GameSpy and ICQ that lets you instantly play games with friends, coworkers, family, your kids.. from anywhere? Maybe its an app, maybe its an API, maybe its tied to a platform like Apple messaging but maybe its a PWA and goes anywhere. You can game, but you can also reflect your life and experiences like Instagram (without the privacy/snooping/hate speech) so people can share and grow. Gamestop would regulate the shit out of content with super supportive moderation and a heavy fucking hand.

Similarly to Gamestop's business partner Microsoft's Xbox, they can help censor and report malicious or offensive content and hate speech in online experiences. That crap has no place. Instead of pitching mountain dew and doritos, jolt cola, top ramen like at LAN parties, sell some nutritious and not too-marked-up food staples because parents will just leave their kids there for a while.

While the parents are there, hook them into gaming with their kids, and being gaming mentors for their kids' friends and other folks. Gaming mentors can be a badge, old nerds love that shit, or offer discounts to game subscriptions and services. Mentor/GM/advise parents for X hours and get game exclusives. Teach them that grandma and grandpa like games, that we can all bond through entertainment.

Gamestop used to be the linchpin, similarly to GameSpy for finding friends playing games, or ICQ being the communicator, whatever. Game studios threw them away, but lost their ability to talk to their customers. Keep Gamestop retail stores as these mini arcades, basically a fun version of the Apple store, where yeah, you can buy a console and Nintendo minifigs or whatever.. but a kid can use their Gamestop save card and tap into their last progress with some puzzle fighter, or tap in to get an exclusive skin for Minecraft by solving some STEM puzzles, whatever. Don't like retail stores? Great! Get rid of them- we're in an age where you can host wide user research panels through Zoom, Teams, whatever.

Game studios and hardware/console makers can tap into their raw customer base here. Transparently advertise paid panel sessions where actual kids who play the game can just call Blizzard a bag of fucking dicks and Blizzard will pay to hear it. Good developers are desperate to hear feedback, good studios will flock to it, and Gamestop employees are brilliant, they can easily crosstrain as user research panelists/experts. Shit, introduce that into the transaction and sell game studios anonymized customer reports. At checkout or if customers ask about products and services, write it into the process of sales advisement (not pushing games though!) on collecting feedback and make SURE the customer understands their feedback to employees will be used to help shape games- but its anonymized, no user data collected.

With all this opportunity also comes trust... put trust #1. Microsoft with Satya was all like ""play well with others"" and ""truuuust bitches."" There's been gaps sure, but them and Apple under Cook are trying (and should) lock advertisers out of their ecosystems. Nobody should be reading your kids' gaming or reading habits, but the parents. Fuck Facebook, fuck Robinhood, etc.

Now this is a low effort elevator pitch but if $GME or any of their partners, potential partners, want to make a play, I'll sign up to write a pitch deck, a one pager, whatever. I'm an MBA in tech, former Gamestop customer, raised in computers.. but I'm also not a gamer. I mostly garden and do outdoor shit, but I still love some wholesome entertainment. Seeing AOC stream Among Us on Twitch with fellow congresswomen blew my fucking mind. Let's fucking do this! Sincerely, *diamond hands*.

PS.. grow from within, Gamestop employees are, I'm sure, itching to get in on ground floor growth. Having a resource like that to tap for leadership opportunities is huge.

PPS.. Sherrilyn Ifill wrote a fucking beautiful report for Starbucks on how to engage communities after Starbucks shit the bed for the .. fourth time or whatever and fucking arrested their own customers for buying coffee while being Black. You want the literal business plan read ""[Toward a Vision for Racial Equity & Inclusion at Starbucks: Review and Recommendations](https://www.demos.org/research/toward-vision-racial-equity-inclusion-starbucks-review-and-recommendations)"" and also buy her books, and watch every recorded lecture of hers you can find online, then contract her & her network to tailor this FOR GAMESTOP. Gamestop was, and is about community- diverse and inclusive community, and racial equity & inclusion should be #1. Growing up in Chicago dragging the few PC's we had to empty corner offices all over the north and south side to hook up and play Command and Conquer, AOE, whatever, that is some shit for everybody. It is the ultimate free childcare for parents. Your kids will play this for TWENTY FOUR HOURS while eating uncooked ramen and BE HAPPY.

The main post has 200\~ gilds, and has a post history of two, less than one sentence posts from 8 months ago before making the most popular ag post.

One account started posting for the first time in 9 years to promote silver.

Another users first post isn't even to casually comment on the most important investing story in recent history but to make a 12 paragraph argument for silver.

Now I see what's happening with Game and want to buy a share or two and hopefully punish the scum that we're rewards in 2008 for destroying so much, almost 30 and can't afford my own rent, cr insurance, health insurance etc all at once, hence living with family again... :(

The company’s Mobile Monthly Active Users improved sequentially in fiscal second-quarter 2021, a trend that most likely continued in the fiscal third quarter. This is because of increased adoption of mobile devices by consumers as the primary method of accessing Alibaba’s platforms.

Number one is that while this community is generally very optimistic about the meme stock rockets, when the stakes become at all real, so do predictions. This dataset is notably deviant from the degenerate circlejerks you normally come across on WSB. That said... if these numbers can be interpreted as the **real** sentiment of WSB, then we succeeded far beyond our expectations. **Even in the face of the unprecedented market manipulation and downward pressure of the last 2 days, only 8 people out of over 100 actually predicted above the correct price of $325.** The last couple days have been frustrating, but take this as evidence that we are succeeding.

As far as I know the fight's still on. The short's not squeezed and the gains not won.

Not trying to be a negative nancy here, I'm genuinely curious.  In thinking about the ways that GME may or may not play out next week, a thought struck me and I'd like some input that may dictate how long I (and maybe others, if other people have purchased this stock...) should hold for.

Say they started covering their $15 shorts at $100, then re-bought shorts at $150, then $200, etc, then covered their $150 shorts and re-bought shorts at $300.  It could still very-well be a 126% short interest, just that the shorts are now at $300.

This would probably mean that they would have a lot less interest to pay to hold the shorts, and may have a longer lifeline than any single investor who likes $GME would want to hold on to their shares for.

I want to check in because I’ve been getting confirmation privately that the hedge funds are hurting while publicly the news articles are saying they’re doing fine--my confidence in WSB’s power to upend the market with its collective power has gotten stronger.

That’s not why I’m writing now, though. I want to show you how the misinformation train keeps coming. Don’t get on.

First, here’s the funniest example of the media getting shit wrong I’ve seen in a while: on the [Bloomberg podcast The Tape](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE0yMjM2OTYwNDk1/episode/YTgzN2RkYzItNjBkYy0xMWViLTgzMzItMWJmNDg4Nzk1MGNm?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjwgpOM8sTuAhWTzTgGHbRDDVYQjrkEegQIDRAL&ep=6) on January 28, Kathy Burton, the hedge fund reporter for Bloomberg, discusses her piece on the trend dismissively by calling WSB a bunch of “Reddit bros” and saying WSB targeted several stocks Melvin Capital had shorted (not true--GME was the only target, and it was targeted because of its overall SI, not because of Melvin or its founder).

That’s not the worst part. The worst part is Burton repeatedly calls GME “Gameshop” (I’m not kidding, go to 26:40 in the podcast). If you’re going to report on a company, maybe get the company name right, k Kathy?

Now look at this post: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/blackrock-s-hildebrand-calls-short-squeeze-mania-some-nonsense. It’s fucking horseshit.

First, BlackRock and JPMorgan dismiss the trend as something that will come and go (they wish) and they blame the Federal Reserve (“It is not surprising when you think about how much liquidity is in the system, how much policy has fueled asset prices in recent weeks and months” is what Hildebrand, Vice Chairman of Blackrock said).

Now, Blackrock is a former client of mine, and I can say this because they’re no longer a client and I haven’t worked with them for years. **One of the worst stock picks and theses behind that stock pick I ever saw was from a portfolio manager at Blackrock who managed many billions of dollars**. Not everyone at Blackrock is bad (I’ve met some very smart people there), but not everyone is good. So even if someone at Blackrock dismisses GME in good faith, it doesn’t mean shit. But Hildebrand is talking in bad faith, clearly, because she wants higher interest rates so financial firms can lend money at higher rates. It’s very likely self-serving dishonesty.

Then there’s the fact that what he said isn’t even true. Money velocity remains at record low levels, indicating liquidity IN THE REAL ECONOMY is not high (unsurprising since QE is a very ineffective means of getting money into the hands of ordinary people--which is not the Fed’s fault, as that’s not really their job).

Plus, asset prices aren’t showing a bubbly tendency at all. Note how Hildebrand doesn’t address the fact that the Nasdaq 100 went down over 4% last week--hardly the sign of a stock market bubble. He’s full of shit.

That isn’t the worst part of this story.

Perhaps the most egregious example of how Wall Street is trying to spin this in their favor is Anne Richards, Fidelity International CEO, who said in an interview that the GME situation shows why there should be LESS transparency for shorting stocks. I’m quoting Bloomberg:

>“The thing that they could do very very quickly is remove the transparency on where the big shorts are, because that seems to be the trigger,” Richards said. “But then of course that takes away from that market transparency which everybody wanted to put in place after the financial crisis.”

She does NOT suggest that there should be MORE market transparency so that investors know how much a hedge fund shorts a stock and when it shorts, so that big shorts can’t accumulate and trigger an event like $GME mooning--no, the market needs LESS transparency, she says, so that retail investors can’t squeeze hedge funds.

This is obvious bullshit, and the fact that it went unchallenged on Bloomberg is a testament to how shoddy their journalism really is. Bloomberg has been the place that gave massive platforms to hucksters like Dennis Gartman, a newsletter writer who was a punchline on Wall Street--we would always say he’s the best contrarian indicator on the market, just do the opposite of what he does. Gartmen quit his newsletter in 2019, which cost thousands of dollars to subscribe to annually, after getting regular interviews on Bloomberg where he was treated as an expert for the unknowing public despite his appalling track record and constant failures.

Now Bloomberg is giving a platform to WS players who are trying to spin the story to deregulate the industry. Absolutely fucking unreal.

Or, well, it isn’t, really. I have seen this happen in my decade in the industry. I have seen mainstream news articles on reports I’ve written that get those reports exactly wrong. I remember one report in particular where the headline was ambiguous, but the report was very clearly positive on the stock for reason X. The news report from one outlet (possibly Bloomberg) said something like “Analyst bearish on stock for reason Opposite-of-X”. It was really funny, and since correcting the record wasn’t good for my employer’s business, we didn’t bother to. That’s just one of many examples of fuckery I have from the financial press, so this misinformation garbage does not surprise me one bit.

Tldr; read the whole post you lazy fuck. But if you can’t read, here’s the deal: the financial press’s activist misinformation campaign is getting more and more transparent.",2021-01-31 10:22:32

**DISCLAIMER:** THIS IS NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM GME **I AM IN GME** AND I HAVE **NO** REASON TO DIVERT AWAY FROM IT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS POST IS TO GIVE SOME INSIGHT AND POINT OUT A STOCK THAT IS READY TO BLOW.

IF TOO MUCH WORDS IS **NOT** YOUR STYLE AND LITTLE WORD DO TRICK **TLDR IS BELOW** 👇🏼🚀

&nbsp;

# NIO

###### Why NIO?:

- NIO had an **astronomically good** 2020 and really solidified themselves as a legitimate EV company in a fast growing sector. EVs are the literal future but NIO isn't just EVs 😉 More on that later. But for now, EVs are the MOST popular stocks to buy and hold and this will provide a **TON** of stability for NIO and make it a definite high growth stock. **THIS IS LIKE IF YOU COULD BUY TESLA FOR 60 DOLLARS!!!** Don't miss out, this stock has about the distance between the earth and fucking **MARS** left in terms of growth. But you must be asking, why?

- Why: NIO is entering the EV space in China **AND** Europe, in fact it will be the leading EV company in China, and this is huge for a multitude of reasons. 

 - China is the biggest vehicle market in the world right now.
 &nbsp;
 - It will be a big player in China's pivot into lowering emissions and focus on going green.
&nbsp;
 - China loves Luxury vehicles and NIO vehicles are the _definition_ of [luxury](https://i.imgur.com/s5iuFKh.jpg) when it comes to EV's right now especially their new vehicle unveiled during NIO day earlier this January the ET7.
&nbsp;
 - **NIO IS NOT TRYING TO REPLACE TESLA, NIO IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS IT'S OWN BRAND** and I will go more indepth into why NIO is developing itself into MORE than just an EV company later.

&nbsp;

###### Who Matters:

- NIO's CEO **WILLIAM LI** is a literal genius. Dubbed the Elon fucking Musk of China. He has the drive and the motivation to launch this company to the fucking MOON 🚀🌙.

- NIO's Head of AI **Dr. Ren Shaoqing**. This guy is also quite literally a genius. He is the top researcher for NIO's autonomous driving software and this is great news for NIO's SaaS (Software as a Service) and will generate NIO a *TON* of revenue.

As far as background on the company these guys give the company an insanely bullish outlook but that's just the beginning.


&nbsp;

###### Why Now?:

- The closest upcoming catalysts for NIO are **January Deliveries**. (Will be announced sometime during the first week of February) and earnings **March 9th**. These dates are super important and will be **crucial** in NIO's upcoming breakout so keep these in mind! 🚀

- Deliveries and Earnings are so **crucial** because NIO has consistently been on the uptrend and consistently smashing every projection. NIO will _absolutely_ beat expectations as usual and **LI BIN** will not let you down.

- **THESE EVENTS ALONE COULD TRIGGER THE NEXT BULL RUN FOR NIO TO MARS** 🚀🌙. The company is super underrated right now and getting in before the explosion that these catalysts could cause could be one of the most solid plays you ever make. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE 🚀🚀🚀

- NIO's Price Target has been consistently raised over the past few weeks of NIO consolidating.

- NIO had an **extremely** successful NIO day unveiling their plans for advancing NIO into the future and revealing their new [Luxury](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ppSFaFQHAsY/X_tJH_-d4JI/AAAAAAAAQgk/lZ5iMk3_4Ws_1XFjog51w-r0lfos4D6OQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7%2B%25281%2529.jpg) [Electric](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) [Sedan](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) the **ET7**, and the [NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nio-partners-with-nvidia-to-develop-a-new-generation-of-automated-driving-electric-vehicles) Drive Orin chips for their AI Driving NVIDIA-powered supercomputer named **ADAM**. There is even more tech they are bringing soon such as better batteries, better autonomous driving tech, better cameras and sensors for detection while driving on the road, BaaS (Battery as a service), SaaS (Software as a service), and their battery swap stations that are quick and easy to use and are located all over China.

- There was so much hype over the ET7 in china that the NIO app **CRASHED** from getting too many preorders. 🚀

- **NEW** [Factory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/kxf8e7/chinese_media_picking_it_up_new_factory/) built in China and [Europe](https://i.redd.it/8eq9eqb8hja61.jpg) expansion is right around the corner.

- NIO is not in the spotlight and is in what some would call the ***GOLDEN DIP***. NIO is dipped off of lack of news and hype in other stocks making it the absolute *PRIME* to buy calls on sale and **HOLD** until we land on **MARS** making this the perfect buying opportunity.

&nbsp;

###### What makes NIO not *just* an EV company?:

- NIO is differentiating itself from other EV companies by introducing **NIO Life** into NIO's growth as not only an EV company but a **BRAND**.

- NIO in China has a near cult-like following where customers can indulge themselves in the NIO culture. They can earn points by driving their NIO vehicle and contributing to the green movement then use those earned points to buy NIO brand products. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-life). It is really interesting and if it seems corny to you, well it is! But the truth is the typical person loves this kind of brand building and it **really works**.

- To build on this NIO has **NIO Houses** which are recreational buildings in public for NIO users to interact with each other, read, study, host speeches, look at new car models, play music, a kids room and most importantly a **NIO Cafe**. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-house).

- NIO offers special services to it's customers that I will briefly cover such as their special Power Home at home charging stations, Power map locating nearest battery swap/charging stations for you, quick battery swap stations, and [Free Lifetime Roadside Assistance](https://www.nio.com/nio-service). 

**ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER MAKE NIO AN INSANELY FUCKING SOLID COMPANY AND AS CORNY AS SOME OF THE THINGS MAY SEEM THIS IS HOW THEY ARE BUILDING A STRONG AND LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE**. People are already falling in love with NIO in China and there is somewhat of a small cult-like following building itself around NIO.


&nbsp;

###### Why NIO will be very profitable very fast:

- NIO is building a strong customer base due to reasons mentioned above and most of all they are offering their BaaS, SaaS, and [0 down payment](https://cnevpost.com/2021/01/21/nio-allows-customers-to-buy-cars-with-0-down-payment/) to their customers now as well as the release of their new EV Luxury Sedan which will cause a **huge** boost in sales.

- NIO's [BaaS](https://www.nio.com/nio-power) plan is efficient and consumer friendly as well as being unique to NIO. They work heavily in NIO's favor by getting the customer to sign up for a subscription service to receive the newest batteries and the battery replacement is easy and fast. NIO's BaaS will generate a **solid** revenue stream for NIO. NIO's battery swap stations are very quick getting a full battery swap done in **THREE MINUTES** and with NIO's newest OS 2.9.0 the car will enter the battery swap station itself, have parking assist, and allows [summoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QguVzh8q3M&feature=emb_title). 

- NIO's expansion into the green space in Europe will be another profitable revenue stream for NIO and further its brand and recognition in the EV space.

- I want to close this out by saying I am in no way a china shill I just see a value play and am here to share my DD with the rest of you.

- I urge you all to do your own DD and find reasons for yourself on why to invest in NIO and why it is a strong play this year. My DD is simply my opinion that I believe in.

- My price target for NIO EOY is *minimum* 200+, I am very bullish on NIO and I feel the upcoming catalysts will be what launches NIO into the stratosphere 🚀🌌.

- For those that are curious why NIO is trading flat and didn't read too much above it's because NIO has had no *recent* news and is in what I consider to be the *golden dip*. The significant news is coming up soon and it's better to buy **before** the launch while it is in its current consolidation state. 

- Shorter term PT is **at least** 80 by mid March.

&nbsp;

# TLDR;

NIO is a strong upcoming EV company with a variety of unique ideas that differentiate it from the typical EV company. NIO's BaaS, SaaS, Battery Swap Stations, NIO Life, NIO House, and it's sleek looking new [electric sedan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySguV2TwE6w) the **ET7** along with upcoming deliveries announcement the first week February and earnings this March are just enough reasons to 🚀 NIO ➡ THE 🌙.

Positions: Been in NIO since $9 with my original 1/15/21 20c took profit and reinvested into my new positions: 1/21/22 80c

"How GME and Citadel could be the catalyst for the next major correction. Warning, bear hopium is strong in this one.",566,l8zd0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8zd0i/how_gme_and_citadel_could_be_the_catalyst_for_the/,381,1612079923.0,"Pretty sure everyone and their mom at this point know about the whole GME short squeeze and how Citadel is getting rekt. Media and the Reddit hivemind created this whole narrative that Reddit is responsible for squeezing Citadel and co when in reality WSB is just a pawn for the other hedge funds to kill Citadel. Everyone is out here playing 4D chess, look how much profit some of these hedge funds made going long on Gamestop while killing their rival, Citadel.

&#x200B;

There are  3 outcomes from this mess:

1. Citadel and co gets a slap on the wrist and nothing happens. (highly doubt this will happen due to the major media coverage on this and the whole narrative on how this is a ""david vs goliath story"")
2. Citadel and co goes bankrupt and fucked in the ass by SEC. If and when Citadel goes bankrupt, all the brokers are now liable to pay the winners, then the banks are liable, and so on... This will have a domino effect on the broader market, considering Citadel is quite big. This is literally a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, just look at the current VIX. (probably might happen if no one bails them out)
3. The rival hedge funds that are long on Gamestop takes profit and flash crash GME so that Citadel can get out of their short while everyone wearing a suit and tie makes profit off this. (highly doubt this will happen, this would actually the biggest 5D chess move)

&#x200B;

VIX also popped up on Wednesday in response to the whole Gamestop thing. This could very well be the catalyst that kills the bubble when this is all over.

Currently long UVXY and holding QQQ puts. This allows you to profit off of Citadel's collapse while not being at risk to GME.

Stop Overlooking Kodak,0,l8z8yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8z8yo/stop_overlooking_kodak/,62,1612079590.0,"Listen up retards, I know you have a short attention span so I’ll make this quick:  

Kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic. Yes, yes, I know.. Kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon.. a cryptocurrency in 2017, and now pharma in 2020? Anyway, it retraced most of its gains when the SEC opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading.  

 \-About a month and a half ago, the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading, the loan, etc. Now, that doesn’t mean it will still go through, but it certainly doesn’t mean it won’t. Kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into Pharma whether or not the loan goes through. With covid still looming, I don’t see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year, an update MUST be coming regarding Kodak & pharma. 

 \-The market cap is only 700 million dollars. (Micro cap) This is minuscule, it’s less than the amount of money the government was going to give them, and is why Kodak went up so much when it was announced -Its literally more than the company was even worth! Market cap is important because it means Kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of \~$9.60. The higher the market cap, the more money required for a stock price to increase. For example, People are buying Nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap- that’s not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently. 

 \-Relatively high short interest of 25.5% as of last week. This could spark a huge run. If price gets out of control, it would force shorts to cover. It’s obviously not one of the very top shorted companies, but it’s up there and with explosive price action Kodak is known to have, shorts seem to probably expect this by now. Once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard. 

 \-Huge bullish flag/pennant technical setup is primed to breakout. Check the longer term chart.  🚀 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

First, I want to thank DFV u/deepfuckingvalue for showing me the way and leading us to the next galaxy!  **🚀🚀🚀...💎✋only** 

My main thought is this, don't become like the billionaires and multimillionaires of this country and be passive in the community and hoard our money like we're some kinda greedy dragons.

I grew up poor, very poor. So poor that when I was a kid my mom cleaned hotels and got to stay in one because we were homeless when I was 4. I had to survive eating butter, straight butter, for a week, when we ran out of food when I was 13. I've had fears of becoming homeless since then.

One day I was hit head on by a semi truck. I died for a few minutes on the operating table. I got a settlement, started to invest, and made it to $700K in 1 year with a $100K nut. I know, that's nothing like DFV, and I'm nothing compared to him. Because I lost it all.

I was almost a millionaire at 24, but I lost it all by buying down and panic selling later. Remember this next week, Don't Panic. Stay calm. Enjoy the ride. We will see a huge dip come Monday. That's when we ride! Buy the dip, and HOLD!

So back to my main point. Doing kind things to random people who are strangers and friends. That's my goal, besides strong personal financial security. But I don't need to make more than $100K a year to live a great life. I don't. But that doesn't mean I don't want to make millions. Mainly, I would love to make millions like DFV so I could do random acts of kindness and be active about it. Not leave it up to some bullshit charity. I don't know about you guys, but regardless of how big you make it, I hope you consider not become like these selfish billionaires who are hoarding money like it will buy them a golden ticket into heaven.

Unless... That's how it works and nobody has told us?

As we reach 7m+ Degenerates, there are more and more fud and ""the next whatever"" being touted around to DISTRACT us. There are more and more newly-minted-market-gurus-millionaires telling us Melvin's short position is going to squeeze on Monday Tuesday Thursday. Blah fucking blah.

There's CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, and other tute-owned or influenced mouthpieces dedicating entire front pages and taking out paid ads telling us boohoo, they fucking lost, we fucking won already, Melvin closed out, millenial-zoomers are fucking up your longs and the sky is falling. I hate the term ""fake news"" because how often it is wrongly used by the ignorant and because I fucking love the Associated Press, but this is fucking paid-for fake news.

IGNORE ALL THAT NOISE. REMEMBER the MARKET MECHANICS ***WE*** ~~are EXPLOITING~~ **LIKE THE STOCK**:

1. Hedgies borrowed SHARES of the stock and must return SHARES of the stock
2. The SHARES of the stock is LIMITED and they must BUY IT BACK on the open market when called by the lender
3. We are BUYING and fucking 💎🙌 HOLDING all those SHARES. [HIGH demand, NO fucking supply.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) PRICE GOES HIGH since ALL YOUR SHARES ARE BELONG TO US.
4. We will DETERMINE the PRICE when THE SHORT SQUEEZE actually happens, the higher we can HOLD THE LAUNCHPAD FLOOR until then, the HIGHER the SQUEEZE. This is a WAR OF ATTRITION. This is a GAME OF CHICKEN except we don't pay interest (don't buy on margin you retards, RobinHood can change their margin requirements at ANY time and force you to help the hedgies)
5. There IS NO TIME FRAME on WHEN THE SHORT SQUEEZE is going to happen. The lender has discretion on WHEN to call the loans and discretion to MODIFY or even FORGIVE the interest, but they NEED to call it EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER, we can see the trend of credible short data from [Ortex.com](https://Ortex.com), and [S3partners.com](https://S3partners.com), Ortex is affordable and has a free trial, S3's BlackApp less so, the data shows that short % of float is still HIGH for several names in play. This is not to say that the data is infallible or cannot be manipulated, but they provide a better metric than CNBC saying so-and-so closed all their positions and go home.
6. WHEN it happens, THE SHORT SQUEEZE will most likely look like a >**20""\* VERTICALLY ERECT GREEN PENIS** on your DAILY CHART (\*size variance based on the size of your screen) .
7. We are NOT the ones roiling the market-at-large. Our PLAYS are limited to a few TINY-ass names, the ENTIRETY (tens of billions?) of which being only a SMALL FRACTION of one single major SP500 company's market cap (1-2 trillion+).

REMEMBER, THEY EXECUTED a RISKY-AS-FUCK bet with theoretically **INFINITE**  ♾️ downside (only theoretically if we bought all the shares and set our prices at infinity, i.e. never sell). This puts your weekly FDs of OTM calls to SHAME!!! You can't lose more than the cash you put in, but they can lose their EVERYTHING and then some, and they KNOWINGLY went into this. This is NOT our fault, we are NOT doing anything wrong. Our plays are PROVIDING A CHECK AND BALANCE to UNCHECKED hedgefund fuckers that have been fucking us and the companies we love up the ass for DECADES, often ILLEGALLY -- NAKED SHORTS OVER 140% FLOAT (~~short selling with IMAGINARY shares~~ borrowing a share to sell from lender, selling your borrowed share back to lender then borrowing it again--borrow 2x) -- What in the literal fuck?. **Translation:** hedgie borrow 1 🍌to short, hedgie sells borrowed 🍌 back to the broker only to borrow it again. Now hedgie got 2 big fucking 🍌🍌s to short. But ape 🦧🦧🦧strong together and eat both 🍌🍌s yum yum and hedgie is double fucked.

As for various market selloffs last week, they could be folks taking profits after a record year, they could be scared folks who don't understand the situation, they could have just wanted another box of fleshlights, and/or they could also be the hedgies dumping and leveraging their longs to double down, triple down, quadruple down, because they think they can, or they have no choice, but to TRY to OUTLAST US. If they are already going to lose EVERYTHING (by covering at current prices), then what's another few fucking billion to push down the price and hope that a bunch of autistic plebs give up, get bored, or get DISTRACTED? We can't prove this, but their actions, PAID ads, and shill mouthpieces, all speak volumes.

Billionaire fund managers are stubborn, why would they openly admit to loss to a bunch of retards on Reddit if there was nothing to gain? To them, a bigger fund amount is just a new high score. Their lives don't change, they might buy another yacht. So ask yourself, would a monarch of yore, decked in all their splendor and glory, yield to a mere peasant? No.

Most of us are just common plebs working the daily grind, many of us don't even have the daily grind right now due to the pandemic. Our war chests are meager, but combined, together, we have a CHANCE. Billionaire Nick Hanauer wrote an article to his fellow billionaires that [THE PITCHFORKS ARE COMING](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014), well this is what that looks like in the market, our shares are our pitchforks, we are not breaking the law, we are not invading your homes, we are not beheading the aristocracy. We are just giving you a taste of your own medicine and playing by the rules of a FREE MARKET in a country that protects FREE SPEECH.

Do NOT let them distract you! Do not feel bad about what we are doing or the dollar amount in your brokerage account. For once we are playing THEIR game and have a chance of actually winning.

I'm not sure what I wrote that's triggering it to get flagged... but here we go again. 

*I'm not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. This is my understanding and perception of PCG based on my experience and research. Go fuck yourself.*


**INTRO**  

Don't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify.

**TL:DR** \- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -> $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40. SIGNED CONTRACT WITH PALANTIR! Going to be the safest utility in the state EOY. Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!

**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&E)**

PCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   


Since the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   


This last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too f'king slow.   


**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  


I'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining the f'k out of their operation.  


Here is the balance sheet (scroll down for the ""liabilities"" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  


All things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   


**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**

Two weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   


This is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, check out the video from Demo Day 3-4 days ago. I tried to link it, but it keeps rejecting my post due to the YouTube link, so look for it on your own (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo).  


Remember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   


Palantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the ""fear"" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   


**Potential**  


PCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   


This is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FUCKING FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the ""we're you're only fucking choice, deal with it"" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   


**Final note**  


After the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.

One sentence on short selling from Investopedia (too lazy to find this on the SEC website but I'm sure the same sentence is there verbatim): The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the price of any asset can climb to infinity

If short selling can technically result in an infinite loss, then why can a stock's ""value"" not also be infinite when short sellers get caught with their pants down? Couldn't it be argued that the surge in the stock price is not shooting from us artificially driving up the bid to manipulate the market, but rather we just ""value"" what this stock in particular has to offer given the situation?

It has me thinking, what could they possibly try to escape?

1.) Could they liquidate their assets into another company before the debt is due and shutdown capitol before the shorts are due? For example I heard that Toys R Us was robbed by these hedge funds and they forced the borrowed debt back into their hedge fund company. Could they possibly rush a huge debt of melvin and liquidate the debt into one company before the shorts are due? Seems super illegal but based on last week they seem to try anything.

2.) Can they keep affording to pay off the debt indefinitely through higher and higher premiums? I have diamond hands and can hold indefinitely but it got me wondering, if people keep purchasing the calls and push them into the debt contracts, although they run up in value can they just afford to sell new premiums that cover the original debt indefinitely? How are they even selling non-existent funds in the first place??? If that's possible couldn't they keep selling higher and higher amounts of non-existent funds to pay debts?

What else could you guys think of?

Do the greedy 🌈🐻 have a way out? - A GME share offering and SEC Rule 105,178,l8y4we,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8y4we/do_the_greedy_have_a_way_out_a_gme_share_offering/,178,1612076398.0,"Go to the bottom for a TLDR and skip past all the thoughts of a crayon eater. 

I'm an eternally optimistic smooth brain, but countless and humbling failures from over confidence have taught me to be better at checking every blindspot. I've made one post about ways we could be left holding bags of GME already, but this scenario was overlooked. That combined with ADHD-fueled deep diving led me to SEC Rule 105. 

What is Rule 105? 

It says that greedy 🌈🐻 can't short 🍌 in order to try and drive down the price, and then buy 🍌 from 🦧 through a new offering to cover their short. 

If greedy 🌈🐻 violate it, they pretty much just pay a fine and there have been annual occurrences of violating Rule 105 since 2013. Bare with me, I'm going to try and do math. 

For example, [the hedge fund Millennium paid $638,709](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1DG30L) for 4 violations where 10,000 🍌 were shorted each. 

Using 40,000 total 🍌, that works out to a fine of $16 for each shorted 🍌. 

Although it's very hard to speculate the size of a possible Rule 105 fine for the GME 🌈🐻 shorts, let's guess based on this one example for the sake of overly simplified argument, because I don't think my brain (or yours) could possibly handle trying to make it more complicated. This also assumes GME is going to do an offering soon, will offer 58M 🍌 to cover 100% of the shorts, and sell them all to the shorts. I very much doubt that's realistic and GME wouldn't sell them to the 🌈🐻 that tried to make them go bankrupt, but what if it did happen? 

Greedy 🌈🐻 always pay less than the current price, so let's say they pay $150/🍌 to GME to close the shorts entirely:

$150 x 58M = $8,700,000,000 ($8.7B) to GME 

Now let's say they pay a fine of $16/🍌 to pay for their sins to the SEC:

$16 x 58M = $928,000,000 ($928M) to the SEC

$8.7B + $928M = $9.63B 

Less than $10B to get out of the mess they put themselves in. Given that the current risk for the 🌈🐻 is theoretically unlimited, why wouldn't they do it? 

As I said, I'm about as regarded as they come, this scenario is probably unrealistic and definitely over simplified, but is any of this an actual out for the 🌈🐻 that could result in all of us holding bags?

I've also yet to find a rule that says different 🌈🐻 that aren't short can't buy newly offered 🍌 from GME, and then sell them to the 🌈🐻 that need to cover their shorts. So maybe that's a possibility? 

TLDR: Given how unrealistic this seems and the fact there are also SEC rules against doing it, my final forecast for GME this week is 🎮🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. 🤲💎bois and girls because we like the stock and I'll see you in a galexy unknown.

When I found the channel I expected to find a total degenerate. I expected to see some tool sort of like u/WSBGod but with lucky real gains. I was super wrong.

What I found was an extremely smart, soft spoken, humble, and graceful individual.

He found true deep value in a stock and bet on it in a big way. Over the past several months he was welcoming people to challenge him. He was welcoming people to poke holes in his thesis. As GME grew and grew he meme-ed but never gloated. 

This GME situation has now exploded into something that no one (not even DFV) could have foreseen. I can't imagine what is going on for him and his family right now. 

He has been living in a rented house and now he is a multi-millionaire. People here see him as a deity. Some people here are demanding he speak. Hedge funds probably want to see him ridiculously prosecuted somehow for his DD posts. Some people here are demanding that he announce his next play. I have even seen some people here make serious suggestion that he get into politics. 

I think everyone needs to have mad respect for this guy. With that respect we should all understand that what he decides he wants next for himself might not be what some of us envision. 

The world is honestly his oyster right now and he could go in any direction. Maybe he doesnt want to be in the public eye and wants to be left alone. Maybe he wants to be the next Burry with his own Scion Capital. Maybe he just wants things to stay the same as possible and just do youtube videos from his likely soon to be not rented basement. Whatever his choice is this entire community and the world in general needs to respect it. 

I also see people here writing ""If he is holding. I am holding."" This is fine but people need to understand that he likely will not tell us when he is selling (he shouldn't tell us for MANY reasons). In addition, we need to respect that he IS ALLOWED to sell if he decides to do so.

GME for many has become a venue to personally fuck the system down to your last dollar, but it may not be the same way for him. I personally am holding my position to the bitter end for that reason, but he may not. Others may not. DVF is at the core a true value investor. You will learn this if you watch his videos. Value investors typically do not buy and hold stocks forever. I am very interested to see how this ends for him. We all need to respect what one another does with their money. 

From the early days of this forum there have been some major wins that were phony as fuck. Nothing about DFV is phony. He is completely genuine. He is the real Wall Street Bets God.

His name is u/DeepFuckingValue. Let's put respect on that name for what he has done and continue to respect it when he decides how to end it. 

TLDR: In watching hours of DFV content there is no way that you cannot like this guy. He is very smart and very humble. We need to support him should he want privacy. We need to respect him should he exit his position.",2021-01-31 08:58:41

The implications of what is happening with GME go far beyond of what is happening with the stock price. So I want to give my point of view of what is happening and why GME investors are doing a favour not only to themselves, but to the whole world, and I am not exagerating.

# Wealthy investors do not need hedge funds anymore

The fact that hedge funds that ~~waste~~ expend billions a year have been beaten by a bunch of redditor trading from home in their pajamas pose an unconfortable question for them: why do wealthy people need hedge funds?

If hedge funds can be beaten so easily, why pay them outrageous fees? See GME investors have put in danger the whole hedge fund business model. That's why they are scared.

# Hedge funds went full retard

For the first time in life hedge funds are reacting to what retail is doing, they are not leading anymore. They decided to go full retard and short even more once the short squeeze started thinking they could easily beat retail, when the trade moved against them, they just cried and change the rules of the game.

The fact that they have lost several times and have no way out, is huge, because it means they cannot bring any value to their investors, again making their business model crumble.

# They have the weaker hand

They tried to use all kind of scary tactics (CNBC spreading misinformation about shorts, depicting wsb as a bunch of people gambling randomly, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance and many more sites trying to prevent the short squeeze etc), they may have even commited fraud, collusion and market manipulation after what happened on Thursday and Friday. Yet GME investors held the line.

Why? Because they know hedge funds have the weak hand, everyday they are losing money on their shorts, paying interests, while investors just have to hold the stock. There is no hurry in selling, no pressure, and everyday new investors join the party pushing the price higher.

For how many days are they going to keep preventing people from buying?

# They cannot do anything

They may try to close this sub, but it is not possible. Why? Because it would be so obvious that they are doing it because they are losing money that Twitter and YouTube would burn and this would backfire up to the Government.

They may try to prevent retail traders from using leverage products, but that would drain liquidity of options and futures markets and cause potential capital flows into other markets (foreign equity markets, DeFi etc).

If they keep manipulating price and preventing retail from buying, the same applies, capital would flow to other markets so the whole US Financial industry would suffer.

TLDR: HOLD. If you like the stock better buy the stock than weekly calls.

Hedge funds are fucked.

How Wall Street Underestimated WallStreetBets,382,l8xp3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xp3v/how_wall_street_underestimated_wallstreetbets/,142,1612075154.0,"While Wall Street was asleep, WSB became a real player. Here is how:

Here is likely the breakdown of how outsiders thought of WSB (if they thought of us at all):

1. An average retail investor is conservative, buys ETFs, and doesn't trade with options or leverage.
2. A $1m portfolio would rarely have more than $50k (5%) in any singular ""speculative"" stock.
3. We had about 500,000 users, assume $10,000 per user.
4. This gives WSB $5B in assets under management.
5. If you assume the average retail investor only invests 5% into any singular play, this would give WSB $250m in buying power for any given play.
6. Assume a finite and largely fragmented ecosystem here where at most any play gathers 10% of our users behind it.
7. This would make the total buying power of WSB on a single play roughly $25m.

Assumed buying power: $25m, basically a small family office, not even a blip on the radar.

Here is the rub. That math was completely broken:

1. YOLO: Our user base is willing to risk 10%, 20%, 50%, 100% of their portfolio on a single bet. Assume the average user will push 25% of their portfolio on a signal play.
2. This immediately gives us 500% the buying power of average retail traders. We just went from $25m to $125m in buying power.
3. We use options and leverage. Assume an average of 500% more blended leverage than the average retail investor (mainly based on options more than margins). This takes our buying power from $125m to $750m for a single bet.
4. Growing Ecosystem: a strong play on WSB is/was not limited to our user base. More people outside of WSB joined in, growing our numbers from 500k to over 5m people. Assuming more fragmentation: a 5% engagement rate on a single play grows our potential dry powder for a single event to $3.75 Billion.

Even $3.75 Billion may be conservative with some institutional investors following WSB

TLDR outside investors likely thought our potential buying power was $25m, in reality, it was off by 15,000% and it was probably $3.75+ Billion",2021-01-31 08:39:14

Tl;DR: if we simply stay put we can guarantee the absolute best outcome for all. If we act selfishly we guarantee the worst outcome for all.


For those that have a pimple in their otherwise smooth brains:

The prisoners dillema suggests that people when confronted with the opportunity to cooperate to guarantee a good outcome for all will generally act selfishly and end up worse than if they had cooperated.

 However experiments show that humans are biased towards cooperation and will in real situations, more often than not, cooperate for a generally better outcome for all.

Point is, we have evolution on our side. Paperhanding is like snitching to get out ahead of your fellow retard. Hold the fucking line and DO NOT SELL! Buy more GME on Monday if you can and stick with it!

Some of you retards need to understand the brokers you’re using.,159,l8xiv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiv2/some_of_you_retards_need_to_understand_the/,183,1612074672.0,"Most brokers, or the legit ones are insured by organization known as the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

Which is a federal organization that insures your portfolio. UP TO $500k and a LIMIT OF $250k for cash. 

So don’t worry the $5 you got from your grandma is safe even if Robinhood goes down. Now if they do go down, which i doubt they will. Then after everything settles you should expect your money after a few months.

So its not lost. 

One thing to note is, if you own stocks on robinhood SPIC will pay the amount of the stock at the time of liquidation not when the broker goes down. 

So lets say RH goes down tomorrow and GME traded at $500. When SPIC starts to act and reimburse you for your shares they won’t give it to you at $500. They’ll return it to you at the current market price. 

There’s really no reason to panic, at least not yet. Robinhood may be shit broker but they are pretty successful. The investors behind a reputable broker like that won’t let it go down.",2021-01-31 08:31:12
BCRX: The most undervalued stock in the market,115,l8xiqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xiqh/bcrx_the_most_undervalued_stock_in_the_market/,487,1612074662.0,"First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track** status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that [98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market** based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. [The UK is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow [R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus) or [nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. [Optime care even lets patients get direct-to-patient prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that **its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,** and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

Think twice before investing in $SLV,175,l8xaik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xaik/think_twice_before_investing_in_slv/,299,1612074002.0,"SLV saw an inflow of almost one billions dollars on Friday, which is nearly double that of the last record. There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

> The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Trustee”) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the “Custodian”). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift.",2021-01-31 08:20:02
Serious - What Will Make Hedge Funds Close Shorts?,355,l8x8ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8x8ja/serious_what_will_make_hedge_funds_close_shorts/,515,1612073843.0,"The Short Float is still around 122% \[[1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)\], or 61.78 million shares \[[2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)\]. If the Borrow Fee is around 32.8% \[[3](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\], then at the current stock price of $325 the short holders would be paying $18 million per day if they don't cover (.328\*$325\*61.78 million/365 = $18 million).  The cost to cover the shorts right now would be $20 billion ($325\*61.78 million).

Let's imagine a second scenario in which they wait and assume the stock price will slowly fall to $150 over the next year. In this scenario, they'd pay a total of $3.35 billion over the course of the year in Borrow Fees, and then cover their shorts for another $9.27 billion. That'd bring the total to $3.35+9.27 = $12.62 billion.  So they'd save $7.38 billion dollars.

Obviously this would be a bet by them that the price would fall, and if it doesn't they just wasted another $3.35 billion in paying a years worth of borrow fees. But is there anything to stop them from trying to go this route? What would cause the broker to demand the hedge funds buy back all their shorts immediately?",2021-01-31 08:17:23

I've been in the nonprofit world for a while and can tell you there's a lot of ""charities"" out there that do fuck all with the money you give them or just let it sit in their account for the duration of the disaster that people were donating to alleviate (looking at you, Red Cross).

It makes me physically ill to think of your giving going to waste. I'm not going to tell you to give to the arts, or to medicine, or to space exploration. Just be sure to investigate where you're giving and don't trust the ""Top 10 charities for X"" posts you see all over the interwebs. I have provided for your sleuthing pleasure a few websites to vet your giving. They will allow you to search by name, type, etc. Give them a look and see.

[https://www.charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/) \- Will tell you how the charity compensates their executives, their cost-to-raise ratio, and the program to overhead ratio.

[https://www.givewell.org](https://www.givewell.org/) \- Another organization that researches top charities to provide transparent data.

[https://www.charitynavigator.org/](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) \- Probably the most in-depth of the bunch on the ones that they review. They go into detail on the impact, results, accountability, and culture of whatever organization you look up.

Also, there's a boat load of foundations out there that would love to take your money and watch it grow. Many of them already have securities and other assets. *You can sometimes donate assets directly and the wealth keeps growing.* \*\*You can also bequeath another account to an organization.\*\*This means you don't touch it but name your charity as a beneficiary. Let it grow, then when you die, Tendie Claus will drop it in their chimney. For more information:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp)

Other points to consider: Cost-to-raise is not always a good measure, so do your DD on charities. For charities that have most or all of their capital and assets donated, the cost-to-raise should be exorbitantly low. Don't confuse PACs with charities. Here's an example: PACs donate to pro-X legislation and legislators. Charities donate their services, products, and education falling under the X rubric to people in need.

If you're more interested in activism and advocacy, you can find some great resources here:

[https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php) \- Watchdog for PACS[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee\_type=O](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee_type=O) \- List of Super-PACs

[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/) \- List of hybrid PACs

My apologies to the Europoors. Can't help you because I'm a lowly American't.

Bless all you magnificent bastards who have already done God's work in sharing the wealth you've accumulated on your own volition.

Tl;dr: Use these resources to research companies before you consider donating.

Edit: There are some 3rd party services out there that help certain non-profit organizations (charities and companies alike) with what we call ""passive investment"" or ""passive activism."" Amazon Smile is a good example of this. A portion of your purchase goes to whatever 501c(3) company you select that's registered. But it's 🥜 compared to an actual gift.

Edit 2: Thank you u/onomoto81 for the link to a philanthropy podcast that discusses the considerations you should evaluate before giving ever and at all. I skimmed it and it seems on the up and up. Philosophical but at least worth the listen.

Probably the most important thing you can read regarding GME

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img qq1cm0figie61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. 

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. 👐💎👐

He danced around the question of why he did this by alluding to how he wanted to protect investors. This is all a SHAM.

There is a significant chance that had they not halted trading on the relevant stocks, they would've been **insolvent** by close of trading, depending on the size of their credit line. **This is why they raised $1 billion as an emergency from investors**. The reason why he wasn't clear about this, was because if you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions. You also run the risk of going insolvent. **It is no coincidence that they've been halting buying on literally any asset as soon as the volume on it starts to massively increase.**

This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. Vlad certainly didn't help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues.

I read WSB for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time.

*Disclaimer: I'm a moron and not a financial expert, I own GME shares. This is all my opinion.*

Hello, my fellow retards. This GME movement has been seriously heartening for the common man, and the following that WSB has gained because of it is completely bonkers. This is all well and good, but on some level, GME is still a numbers game to me. Melvin announced that it had closed its position in GME and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim. I have some 8 pm coffee-fueled napkin math that suggests... maybe?

**Point 1:**

[Here](https://www.shortvolume.com/) is a website I've found very confirmation bias-y. It gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day. Over the last 10 days, we see a short volume of approximately 200m. That is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for Melvin to have exited their short -at first glance at least. If we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 1/22 through 1/26 there is approximately \~82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range. Then, from 1/27 to 1/29 (after GME broke $300) there is \~34m short volume. If we assume that EVERY SINGLE SHORT got out, then bought back in as the price rose for the last \~80m volume (to ultimately bring us to the SI estimate today) the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding, on average, is about **$180 per short**. In other words, **shorts are still massively underwater even if they've been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week**.

**Point 2:**

CNBC could be lying.

**Point 3:**

[CNBC could be telling the truth.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) This article mentions what a few experts (yes, Shkreli is an expert here) have said at this point: WATCH THE INTEREST RATE. If melvin exited their position as fast as they could, and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack, the interest rate would fall through the floor. I am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month, but Melvin having probably the single largest short position on GME would definitely shake up the numbers. Edit: u/_UDW mentioned that [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1DG7CAHua6XMuTf1zcioplEVRMnC-59LcNaiL-ck3qrklMsBDhtbfGytQ#Echobox=1611941927) also disagreed with the possible Melvin exit.

**Point 4, the Devils Advocate:**

Melvin, as per the CNBC article, completely exited its position on 1/26. That Tuesday was two things: the cleanest rising day we've had since $35, and some of the highest volume GME has ever seen. In my opinion, that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as Melvin unwinded their position, and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without *completely* fucking the price.

**My conclusions:**

Melvin being out or not isn't a huge deal, but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone. I am positive that a multibillion-dollar hedge fund would rather book a 30% year loss than a bankruptcy, and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman. However, at this point, someone is still holding a -100% bag at *least* and these new shorts entering GME, then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up.

TR;CR:

Melvin is probably lying but it doesn't matter, buy GME. \*rocket emoji\*",2021-01-31 07:39:09

I threw some curveballs in so if you get everything right then you know why you like this stock.

Had a showerthought the other day.  Wouldn't it make sense for our government to support retail investors through this, for the simple reason that, majority of shares traded and profits made, are likely to be hit w/ short term capital gains tax.  That's good for the government, economy and national debt.  Otherwise, profits that are made by hedge funds and other Wallstreet elitists would likely put into off shore tax havens.  Help me out, I'm pretty retarded so what am I missing...?

But it happened to me today, while I was reading something, that the explainations we are getting from everywhere are partially wrong, for different reasons. 

First: 

Right now we have two different POV 

1) The wsbetters are going to earn a lot of money because the big squeeze is on the horizon 

2) The wsbetters are going to lose a lot of money because the HF already succesfully exited. 

My opinion is that The most exposed shorts were closed two days ago, but there is still a lot of pain in front of them (so, hold, I hate them) but The entire market is going to de-leverage, and start to go down, and, guess what? They'll blame WSB for this.

Road to Nowhere,104,l8wafs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8wafs/road_to_nowhere/,25,1612071184.0,"My story starts in 1981. After Reagan declared war on family farms and kicked out agricultural subsidies and commodities purchasing by the USDA to support family farms, it took about a year before the Farm Crisis got into full swing. My Dad made the TV news when our family dairy was the first in Northern Minnesota to be put on the block by the FDIC as they liquidated our bank to “protect investors”.

My father began a process of making progressively more desperate bets in order to try to support his family, sold Shaklee, was in three or four multi-level marketing schemes, sold insurance, ran a saw mill, started a small handicap equipment manufacturing company, before throwing in the towel and accepting what money I and my brother could spare him from our student loans. When I joined the Navy in desperation (abandoning college), all their utilities were cut off and he had finally given in and accepted welfare and food stamps.

Over the years, he finally got a service connected disability (Vietnam), and after my mother passed, now lives, not comfortably, but adequately. His story is finally to its “happy ending”(?).
My road has been paved with extremely hard work, and I am doing okay, no thanks to the powers that be. Completed my service in 1992, did okay as a blue-, then white-collar person, until 2008...declared bankruptcy to save my family’s home, out the other side and finally, I think, going to make it. No retirement in our future; at least not yet; but we’re okay.

So, I hope you accept this disenfranchised Gen-Xer, and thanks for the welcome.
As I buy the GME/AMC/BB/NOK train (2/20/30/100), I can’t help but have a particular song stuck in my head...

**HOLD GME! DO NOT SELL! BUY THE DIPS! GME HAS NOT POPPED. I'm writing this only because it's a smaller $ value trade and some of you may be able to put a tiny amount in and get some food for your 9 children, or at least start paying child support. Loser.**

 I know a lot of you fuckers are already in MAC and we can make another round of people rich. Note I have a $1k stock position in MAC, so this isn't a big money maker for me since I didn't buy call options -- but I'm going to... I just want to share what I've found and how I see things, so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic.

Why I think MAC is such a hold position is because look at the short interest: https://imgur.com/a/YY9Ymku. It has been at or near 70% for a long time and the short interest is dropping (see graph on imgur slide). Why I think this is important is because MAC was trading around $6 a year ago. I think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices -- probably shorts at really low prices that can't get out because the current price. (That's my logic at least, someone with more market knowledge please let me know if that's not the correct way to think about things.)

Also, I think MAC has been collecting rent and has good financials/cash (like GME), so it is undervalued. (Can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on MAC?)

MACs market cap is a lot bigger (5x's) that of where Gamestop was at. I think this may make it harder to squeeze -- but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in.

Thoughts and help appreciated. And, if I'm totally idiotic, you can tell me that too.

EDIT: One other thought -- MAC is a good short-term and long-term play. If you look at options, they're really cheap. Now go look at the 5 day chart -- see how the stock has been bouncing off $23? If you buy the cheapest February call options, I think you can easily make it to $23 -- and I think there's a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had. I can't trade options right now because it's taking forever to get money into my trading account (oh, yeah, I never traded until GME and I've never traded options, so again, I'm a retard). But -- DFV made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option, at least leave me a thumbs up on here. 

Don't buy Reddit medals -- put it in GME.

Look. In 1999 mark cuban wanted to lock in his broadcast.com gains but held only yahoo stock he couldn’t sell for 3 years. So what he did was buy what’s called a collar which often costs little to nothing.  So if a monkkeee wanted to hold but didn’t want big loss they could theoretically take some lots of 100 and for each one they could sell a 2023 call and buy a 2023 put.  This locks all gains and you can hold theoretically forever by rolling, and essentially makes it where you only can get called away at say $400+.  

Does this make sense or am I missing something? This is legit just a question as I’m a  humble moron and don’t know anything so this is NOT financial advice. I’m literally just curious.

Downside maybe  is that call buyers of the calls you sell could then lock in at whatever the strike was preventing a big squeeze on price for them, but maybe upside makes it easy for people to keep holding. Maybe allows people to diversify without fear of losing it all

Can someone please clear this up for me?

EDIT: sounds like many said this might not allow for highest price spike so probably not a good strategy, again I know nothing was just asking, carry on discussion or mods feel free to delete this post

An alternative to transferring brokerages and potentially missing the squeeze: Robinhood Cash Account.,60,l8w9gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w9gq/an_alternative_to_transferring_brokerages_and/,60,1612071109.0,"**Update: If you are getting a 404 error, I recommend contacting their support and requesting they downgrade your account to a Robinhood Cash account. I don't think this is nefarious - I've seen this 404 error since at least November.**

**Update 2: Robinhood makes money LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES to shorts AND THEY KEEP THE INTEREST. if you switch to a Robinhood Cash account, they will be unable to lend out your shares.**

A ton of this sub uses Robinhood and after what happened the last few days, we all want to jump ship.

Not only did Robinhood restrict buying of GME, but since we are all on Margin Accounts, technically Robinhood owns the stock and simply passes many of the rights of ownership to us, crediting us with quasi-ownership.

This is important because if Robinhood fails, we don't actually own our stocks - Robinhood does and those shares we paid a lot for could just as well go bye-bye.

The obvious solution is to get the fuck off Robinhood, but it ain't that simple. If you begin a transfer of your assets to another brokerage, your positions will be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Every single day counts right now, and that is simply not an option.

As much as we shit on Robinhood, we really need to be rooting for them to succeed and get an influx of cash to be able to post it as collateral with DTCC to get our trading activity back to normal.

All that being said... there is an alternative solution to save our asses:

**Robinhood Cash Accounts**

[Details here - CLICK MEEEEE\~](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)

In short, when you sign up for Robinhood you start off with a **Robinhood Instant** account. This is a margin account.

If you're like many of the retards on here, you upgraded it to a **Robinhood Gold** account. This is still a margin account.

There is a third option: a **Robinhood Cash** account. You do not get access to instant deposits. You do not get access to instant settlements. If you sell anything, you'd need to wait 2 trading days before having access to the cash. Essentially, you're no longer relying on the magic of margin accounts to make everything look instantaneous to you.

Does that suck? Yeah, kinda, but **you get full control and ownership of your shares**.

I will be downgrading my account to a Robinhood Cash Account and once this is all over, I'll be transferring to another brokerage.",2021-01-31 07:31:49

Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks. We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.

This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week. Notice how it says ""... this thing is happening in the next few days."" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks.

I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co-operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to ""normal levels"" (fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit). Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?

2 years ago I was hospitalized with the worst bout of depression. I never imagined how bad depression could be. I was weeping literally every day. Couldn't do shit but cry all the time and contemplate why I was even fucking here. I was going to school to get into a career that I didn't even want to be in, and I legitimately felt like I was a useless POS that was only a drain on everyone around me and they'd all be better off if I was gone. That depression took EVERYTHING from me.. my confidence, self-esteem, self-worth, humor, and much more. Now, I'm a garbage man in NJ with a fucking bachelor's degree and student loan debt and I live in a fucking doll house owned by my wife's grandparents, right next door to her nosy ass parents, cause we can't afford shit else. Thankfully her boyfriend chips in on rent so he has a discreet place to bang her whenever he wants. My life these past 2 years has been a slow climb out of the fucking abyss, and for the first time in 2 years, I have something that has me literally uncontrollably excited! I started trading a few months ago with everything I had saved up (not much). All ""smart"" investments with long-term growth almost guaranteed. Then, here you fucks come along with an idea for the heist of the century. I read the posts, saw the action, and said ""You son of a bitch, I'm in."" I sold almost all of my PUSSY stocks and stuck my dick in GME! THIS IS EVERYTHING I HAVE.

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are a big rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it** (in real life that is, say whatever you want anonymously on WSB. Half my post history is about my net worth, ffs). Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit.

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said. Thanks.

**(edit) Mods, it's okay to delete this repost if you deem it necessary. I'm honestly really disappointed that u/DeepFuckingValue was identified by the WSJ and other media outlets in the days since I first posted it. I was hoping he would stay anonymous and ride off into the sunset, but it's none of my business if he didn't want that for himself.

All input is appreciated and it’s a shame that so many big brokers did dirty on their customers but it’s good that it shed light on who the real brokers should be.

Edit: It’s safe to say 90%+ of the commenters here argue that fidelity is the go to. A good portion of the fidelity backers say the only upgrade Fidelity really needs is to get a cleaner UI and it will be a go to platform for a lot of investors. A few people are commenting saying that we should rally and get a sub going to get Fidelity’s attention to reshape their UI. Any help with writing a convincing post would be great, feel free to message me and we can get a group going for it.",2021-01-31 07:24:47

This is my personal research into Pacific Gas & Electric Company. They have perpetuated evils on the environment and mankind. Not an endorsement- just some compiled findings. 

None of this is financial advice, and is purely fiction.

**MY FIRST DD AND ACTUALLY IDK WHAT I WANNA SAY BUT I RESEARCH A LITTLE SO LOOK IF U WANT, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THIS CASE THANKS.**

*General Background*

>Sector: **Utilities**  
Industry: **Electric Utilities**  
>  
>PG&E Corp. is a holding company, which engages in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers. It specializes in **energy**, **utility**, **power**, **gas**, **electricity**, **solar and sustainability**.   
>  
>The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

[CHART & FINANCIALS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PCG/)

PG&E has a large market cap coming in at $22.684B. And had a revenue of $17.129B.

So why does it have such a negative cash flow? 

    A quick glance at the EBITDA also shows a glimmer of hope. But this metric can be misleading given the nature of the utility industry. Where depreciation and amortization can way heavy on their expenses, replacing power plants and equipment over their vast network is expensive. 

*The Compounding Risks*

You may have heard of how catastrophic this company has been to the environment and people of CA.

>In the last nine years, California has seen a growing number of unnatural disasters that have taken the lives of more than 90 people and caused more than $40 billion in damages. They all have one element in common: They were caused by California’s largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).

[HISTORY SOURCE -- LETS OWN PG&E](https://letsownpge.org/history/)

The impacts of these events can be felt for decades. Litigation is expensive and also takes years. 

    For example:
    In 2019 they paid $11B  for the California wildfires that torched wine country back in  2017 and for the Campfire in 2018 that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.

[2019 $11B SETTLEMENT SOURCE](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760479525/pg-e-to-pay-11-billion-insurance-settlement-over-wildfires-in-paradise-and-elsew)

The litigation expenses caught up with PG&E.

**They filled chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29th 2019.**

*What is chapter 11 bankruptcy, more specifically ""debtor in possession""?*

>Chapter 11 is typically used to reorganize a business, which may be a corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership. A corporation exists separate and apart from its owners, the stockholders. The chapter 11 bankruptcy case of a corporation (corporation as debtor) does not put the personal assets of the stockholders at risk other than the value of their investment in the company's stock. A sole proprietorship (owner as debtor), on the other hand, does not have an identity separate and distinct from its owner(s). Accordingly, a bankruptcy case involving a sole proprietorship includes both the business and personal assets of the owners-debtors. Like a corporation, a partnership exists separate and apart from its partners. In a partnership bankruptcy case (partnership as debtor), however, the partners' personal assets may, in some cases, be used to pay creditors in the bankruptcy case or the partners, themselves, may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  
>  
>Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code places the debtor in possession in the position of a fiduciary, with the rights and powers of a chapter 11 trustee, and it requires the debtor to perform of all but the investigative functions and duties of a trustee. These duties, set forth in the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, include accounting for property, examining and objecting to claims, and filing informational reports as required by the court and the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator (discussed below), such as monthly operating reports. 11 U.S.C. §§ 1106, 1107; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2015(a). The debtor in possession also has many of the other powers and duties of a trustee, including the right, with the court's approval, to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons to assist the debtor during its bankruptcy case. Other responsibilities include filing tax returns and reports which are either necessary or ordered by the court after confirmation, such as a final accounting. The U.S. trustee is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the debtor in possession with the reporting requirements.

[US COURTS -- CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics)

Chapter 11 bankruptcy is going to come with added risks.

* The ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases that satisfies all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;
* The ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;
* The risk that the Note-holder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated; So far there is compelling evidence that there are a number of headwinds going forward.

These are 3 out of 17 risks PG&E is recognizing, with the possibility of more unseen risks. 

[2019 PCG 10k FILLINGS](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pcg#i_0_40)

*What's next?*

So far there is compelling evidence of significant headwinds in PG&E's recovery.

1. Continuing litigations and settlements are costly.
2. Debt restructuring will come with its own risks. 

As a result of the wildfires Public Safety Power Shutoff was created.

**M A G I C   K A R P   T O   T H E   R E S C U E ! ! !**

**January 19th, 2021**

PG&E signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Palantir to provide Foundry software.

>Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has initiated deployment of Palantir’s Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  
>  
>The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  
>  
>“Our engagement with California’s largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region,” said Olivier Farache, Palantir’s Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. “It shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.”

[SOURCE](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005164/en/Palantir-Providing-Technology-to-Enhance-Safety-and-Reliability-of-Electric-Grid-in-California)

The increasing size and magnitude of PG&E's operation innately led to an increase in disasters.

 & Corruption within the company have slowed recovery and any efforts towards lasting change on its infrastructure.  

With the use of Foundry this could be the start of less wildfires and a more efficient utility company. 

The road ahead is a tough one for PG&E. But its tempting when its stock price is at levels we have not seen since 1999. And when debt restructuring + Foundry software could change the long term out look of the company. 

**The play?**

Bull case: Foundry significantly helps mitigate disasters and debt restructuring is approved quickly... **$17c Expiring December 17th**

These disgusting crooks have taken the market manipulation to a new level. When the small guys win, it’s war. 

If you don’t already know, Citadel is a hedge fund that (ran) Melvin Capital Management. 
Citadel owns Robinhood. The blatant restriction of trading stocks and crypt0 is a clear sign that Robinhood does not give a fuck about you, your tendies, or any other trader on their platform. Greasing the pockets of the wealthy is much higher on their list than ensuring traders a fair, open, competitive market.

The only way to win this battle is to boycott Robinhood, and any subsidiaries of Citadel LLC. Furthermore, we must file SEC complaints, and sue Robinhood. (Which we have already started!) We can not allow the rich, greedy, immoral tendie-thieves in power to thrive once again.

Like they did in 2008.

This is a monumental economical achievement, which will be written about in the history books. We took down a greedy, overreaching hedge fund. 

But the fight is not over. This is bigger than Citadel. This is about the continuous market manipulation that is allowed to go on behind our backs, while the 0.1% continue to thrive and prosper.

"Can shorts actually afford to pay out a MOASS situation? Let's discuss how this actually plays out, the impact on the broader market, and some alternative plays (SPY puts?)",57,l8w198,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/,98,1612070471.0,"I am trying to think through this GME squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets. I have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this MOASS should happen.

I have a full grasp of the concept, I’ve been in it since November. My biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious, monster squeeze goes down?

And, should those of us with other holdings be buying SPY puts as a hedge, or as a cheaper correlated MOASS play?

**How do we get our money?**

In the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k, 5k even saying 30k a share.. I’m thinking “ok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that I can then take out to buy a house?”

The answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere, using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt. So first off, wouldn't this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell? And maybe the situation isn’t that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds- but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money?

But then the next leap is if they can’t pay then the money comes from who? MMs and brokers who sold the positions? Will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that? And if so, where does that come from- the same place of liquidating? Or if they spend all their dry powder on this, doesn’t that shake the market?

Basically- wouldn’t the true, ultimate MOASS crash the stock market? Am I being crazy here?

**Outcomes Breakdown**

That brings me to- should we be hedging our other positions/sneakily playing the GME squeeze with puts? Here are some outcomes I've thought through:

* Situation 1: I am over stating this, shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to- they just don't want to. Or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape. Loss on puts, possible loss on GME
* Situation 2: We are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a TSLA-like melt up. People continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze, big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term- small dip in SPY and GME is a slow tendie cooker.
* Situation 3: squeeze happens soon and violently, hedges fire sale to cover, there is an immediate medium but short market dip.
* Situation 4: hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the MOASS and still have a ton left to cover, money has to come from elsewhere. Funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses. Robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt. Chaos and loss of confidence in the markets- large market dip/actual financial crisis??
* and my least favorite, Situation 5: if it’s true the MOASS would crash the market and that’s why they blocked it from happening this week, won’t they shut down the market before they let it happen? In this scenario, they close the market for the day, get the shorts to agree with GME management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford, then tell all of us “get fucked, you don’t deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy?” Gme goes down to its “real value,” GME management gets billions to work with, maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse, spy life goes on. Long term hold so not an absolute disaster, but ouch. Lots of anger.

As a last thought- If someone smarter than me steps in and says “yes it’s true, there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1k/share outstanding and that is totally where we are going,” does that change our strategy? Because isn’t it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an IOU for 20k/share that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt Robinhood, and a class action suit that goes nowhere? Plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real.

Open to any discussion on this end game.

**TLDR:** Would a MOASS crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere? And if so, should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through SPY puts? Lastly- if that is the case, we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen, and how they would actually handle it.

Sideline autist question about short interest over 100% - can the same share be short sold more than once?,11,l8vzd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8vzd1/sideline_autist_question_about_short_interest/,30,1612070321.0,"I have been reading all the DD about the GME short interest being more than the entire float of the stock. 

The main explanation given for how that comes is naked shorts. 

What I want to understand is whether the same actual share can be sorted multiple times. 

For simplicity let’s assume no one has instructed their broker not to lend their shares. 

Let’s take an example where we have:

-	(A) - long GME
-	(B) - short GME
-	(C) - wants to buy GME
-	(D) - wants to short GME

(A) has bought 1 GME share. 

(A)’s broker has lent the share to (B) to short sell it. 

(C) buys the 1 share in GME. (C) has no idea that the share they are buying was sold to them by a short seller. 

Can (C)’s broker now lend that share to (D) to short it?

If not - why not? Forgetting any philosophical position around short selling overall, (C) has paid full price for a share, they should be able to make money by lending it. 

And what technical mechanism prevents this?

If yes, how are issues like voting and dividends dealt with. There is only one share but now two people own it - that doesn’t magically create 2 votes and 2 dividends.

Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This 🚀🚀🚀🚀 will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key.

A Response to RobinHood's Blog Post: Caught In a Lie,92,l8vtoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8vtoe/a_response_to_robinhoods_blog_post_caught_in_a_lie/,31,1612069880.0,"Yesterday, RobinHood released a short blog post as well as a social media post: [https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week)

The reason they claimed users were only able to buy a limited amount of shares or trading was restricted was because of ""clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities \[increasing\] ten-fold"". Basically, when you buy and sell shares, it goes through a clearinghouse, which connects the buyer and seller. The clearinghouse requires the broker to put down a certain deposit based on a number of factors, and robinhood is claiming they couldn't pay for the deposit, thus they had to restrict the buying of shares of certain stocks.

But when volatility increases, many brokers decided to a) not restrict trading or b) increase margin requirements. This seems like the logical choice, no? Instead of barring users from trading, or trading very little, instead, you can increase margin requirements to cover the cost of the deposit.

They also posted this a full day after locking down trading, and yet only selling was allowed? Firstly, if you're going to lock down trading, at least let the users know why immediately after you put the restriction in place. Second, if you can't cover the deposit, then why are you allowing selling? If you claim that you're locking down trading due to ""extreme volatility to protect customers"" then why are you only allowing selling?

Not only that, but you also forcibly sold customers positions on margin, and sold options before market close on the expiry date.

This whole situation seems very fabricated. Not very happy with robinhood, and I've already moved my money out a long time ago for other sketchy stuff robinhood does.

Just a point of interest: GameStop makes almost nothing from new game/console sales. The absolute best thing that you can do for the company from a business perspective is bring some stuff to trade, get the membership, and buy used. It also helps the employees there as they are HEAVILY pressured to meet these quotas.

Yesterday I was in the airport of a city thousands of miles from my home. I saw a guy scrolling / laughing to himself and I thought… “You know, this guy looks a little retarded - I wonder…”

I approached cautiously. Still from afar, like a true creep I spied on his screen - Even from a distance I could tell that he was, indeed on reddit. After a moment, he looked up. I simply said:

“WSB?”
“YEAH!”

It was 100% a little weird at first, but honestly, we felt a kind of kinship immediately - and although I have felt like part of something special over the last few weeks, actually meeting one of you dummies in real life hit different.

We talked a bit about our positions (ha), how we helped save a movie theater chain. History being written. Balance of power shift. What it all means. etc. etc. etc.

As much as we joke here at WSB, yesterday was a perspective shift for me. I usually think of you guys as a bunch of faceless (if entertaining) internet fairies with impeccable foul language.

But yesterday I boarded a plane bound for home with a new friend from thousands of miles away and it made me understand that there are 6 (wait, now 7 holy shit) MILLION living, breathing people with names, faces, and stories out there. We're all doing something important together.

It was really significant moment for me - and I’d be stoked if there was a way I could help more of us experience it.

I’m so proud to be one of you retards.

A possibility for the next couple of weeks that I haven't seen many people consider.,134,l8vrjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8vrjy/a_possibility_for_the_next_couple_of_weeks_that_i/,150,1612069719.0,"This is speculation, not advice. I'm not a financial expert. This is my personal opinion on what might happen with $GME in the next two weeks, based wholly on guesswork. *There's a very good chance there's something that I don't fully understand about the situation and thus I may be talking out of my ass here*.

A lot of people are expecting big moves in the coming weeks- possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday. It's definitely possible that we'll see some crazy stuff go down.

That said, I personally am considering a different possibility- that we'll see a repeat of Friday, where the price stays largely level and stable the whole time. Maybe a couple of smaller dips and peaks here or there, to make things seem realistic, but perhaps $GME might close out in the low to mid $300s all week.

Why might this happen? Well, clearly they realize by now that manipulating the market to artificially drive the price down does not induce panic sell-offs like they thought it would. The more they try to stomp the price down, the angrier and more ardent people get about holding that precious, precious stock.

So- and, again, this is where the speculation comes in- they might try keeping things nice and level. They might be at a point where they're realizing that buying back those shorts at $300 each is a lot better for them than $10,000. How to convince people to sell at $300, though? Just hold the market stable. People have short attention spans, and after a week of massive moves, seeing the price hover within a $20 range might bore a lot of people. Not only that, but the longer this goes on, the more the average person might be inclined to believe that $300 is the real price target for $GME after all.

It's just a thought. I could be totally wrong here.

**TL;DR**: MM and hedgies might manipulate the situation in the coming weeks to slow things down and make it seem like $300 is the real top for $GME, thus people could start selling not wanting to miss out on what they think is the ""peak"". They know forcing the price down doesn't work, so they could very well try to hold it steady instead.

Friday AMC stock close: $13.26. Basically, the same price as a movie ticket.

Here's the data:

1. Stock float (Shares available to be traded): **106.60M**
2. Short float (percent of shorted shares): **41.91%**
3. Average trading volume (Shares traded in a day) including this week's activity: **84.62M**
4. Friday's trading volume (with buy restrictions in place): **594,653,177**
5. Short price **$2.15**

Now you have the data, here's the point...

Short ration is still well over 0.5! That means these bastards aren't giving up. They want to see the stock drop below $3.00, crush the company, and kill the largest employer of high school deadbeats in the country. Some short positions are moving out, but not many. Even with platforms buy restrictions in place the daily volume was 7x the average. 

Aside from the financials, people will be flooding movie theaters soon! People who haven't been to a theater in years will be piling in to see Top Gun 2, The Matrix 4, etc. **BECAUSE THEY CAN!** Movie theaters were taken away from all of us and people will be going back simply because there was a time they couldn't!

&#x200B;

If you have looked into the short squeeze on VW in 2008, you would know that it was Porsche who onset this squeeze by announcing on SUNDAY, October 26, 2008, that they had acquired a \~ 74% interest in the company including \~ 31.5% in cash-settled options. 

&#x200B;

 Because Porsche was quietly building their position in VW, counterparties knew it would cause observable upward pressure on the stock price and decided they needed to hedge their written positions by buying the underlying stock. They also found that they could reduce their hedging costs by lending the underlying to short sellers. 

  
 At this point, there was only \~ 5.5% float due to Porsche's \~ 42.5% combined with 31.5% hedges by Porsche counterparties and \~21% protective stake held by the State of Lower Saxony. At the same time, short interest on the stock was around 13%. The short sellers were essentially in an infinite squeeze.

&#x200B;

The difference HERE is that Porsche held the cards. They offered to settle positions on \~5% of their positions to allow short sellers to meet their obligations. They made a KILLING - estimates are between $6bn - $12bn on much less short interest.

&#x200B;

This whole play was PORSCHE. PORSCHE decided when they wanted to take THEIR profits to benefit THEMSELVES. Fair Play. 

&#x200B;

BUT what is happening right now, THIS is potentially a MASS redistribution of wealth that has NEVER been SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER THIS!!! This isn't one company making massive profits at the expense of Wall Street, this is THE PEOPLE, fighting back...and WINNING.

What (probably) happened with Robinhood and how Vlad Simpnev was left with no good options.,73,l8vcqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8vcqk/what_probably_happened_with_robinhood_and_how/,86,1612068585.0,"Robinhood operates via a clearinghouse that essentially just trades shares with itself, permitting them to essentially trade at whatever price they want. RH was actually investigated and the SEC confirmed the company had been misinforming and misleading investors in inaccurately reflecting market prices in the app, costing individual investors millions of dollars (at least). [SEC Probe](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

It’s also been questioned whether these shares are actually even hitting the market, as noted by some well established professionals like Erik Townsend. The validity of this is beyond the scope of my knowledge. 

Assuming all this information is true, we can assume that Citadel or subsidiaries/partners (say, short sellers or other large clearinghouse partners) owned a large part if not all these shares, simply trading them back and forth in a room of their own, disconnected from the market itself, at prices that may not reflect the true price of the stock. As we continued to buy and hold, some sold for MASSIVE profits, Citadel, and the shorts began to lose on their positions, meanwhile Robinhood was making just cents on every trade, while paying out said MASSIVE profits. 

It was at this point the house of cards began to fall. The clearinghouse is forced to sell and buy in the actual open market as shares continued to be lost to the retail investors, in tandem with the SEC probe from earlier, it spoiled their scheme to scrape cash off the top of these trades. Without this scheme running, and with a mass portion of RH investors turning to only a handful of stocks, RH likely found themselves losing ENORMOUS amounts of cash. As stated by Vlad Simpnev himself they had to take out lines of credit to support this shitty system. 

Ultimately, RH found themselves in a position where if  they don’t do anything they will likely not be able cover the payouts to their investors bagging 10K-10M every other minute of the day. Moreover, in this instance their clearinghouse may well have lost ungodly amounts of cash or worse (bankruptcy), thus leaving RH without a clearinghouse as well. The alternative is what they chose, restrict all trading on this handful of stocks to try and reestablish order in their shitty system while also essentially bailing their clearinghouse out of billions in losses, thus “saving” the company. 

TLDR; delete Robinhood their business model is absolute shit, just like their CEO. They will continue to restrict, and may even go bankrupt without the ability to pay out your investing account.

How to really fuck the hedge funds: educate the world about how you can outperform the hedge funds and why hedge funds will always eventually screw the investors,524,l8v7u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8v7u4/how_to_really_fuck_the_hedge_funds_educate_the/,74,1612068196.0,"Basically, hedge funds are evaluated on their quarterly or yearly performance. Therefore, they employ strategies that will yield the best returns on a quarterly or yearly basis. 

Why is this bad?

Because while they can make money 99 quarters out of 100, during that that 1 quarter where they lose money they lose all of it. 

That means your investments may increase 10-20% a year or whatever boomer gains they promise you, and continue to do so for several years, but one black swan event will pretty much wipe you out. 

For example: 

1999 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2008 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2020 = everyone wiped the fuck out

The hedge fund managers are fine though, because they got paid fat bonuses every quarter while delivering those boomer gains while exposing you to more and more risks. 

And Wall Street? Wall Street gets bailed out. Every time. The people who gambled the economy away is rewarded whether they win or lose. 

What we ought to do is educate people on where to find the tools and resources that will help them make more money than investing in hedge funds. Persuade people to withdraw from hedge funds and become a retail investor. 

Also, when hedge funds do shitty things like trying to destroy a company which employs thousands of minimum wage employees during a fucking pandemic, we catch those hedge funds with their pants down (edit: by exposing them)

Truth be told, you probably shouldn’t. I am a contrarian style investor, and I missed the contrarian signal in March, and entered the uptrend again way too late. If you read my post history, you will see a lot of bad calls and terrible advice (with hindsight, that is). That is why this is not investment advice in any shape or form. I am just as retarded as the next guy. I think, however, I might contribute some things that might not be common knowledge on WSB, and I really miss the good old DD posts amid the whole wsb-goes-vigilante-activist-investor vibe.

**Okay, I am retarded and can barely read. Give me some bullet points before I zone out?**

My main points:

 1.	The main narrative is way too one sided, and everyone’s a bull.

 a.	Remember when everyone was a bear back in March? Yeah, contrarian indicators are a thing. I missed it then and lost most of my gains from the ride down trying to call a top for the “bulltrap”.

 b.	USD shorts and treasury shorts are insanely large (historic record highs a couple of weeks ago), betting on a huge inflation spike any time now…

 c.	Market euphoria and bullishness is also insanely high – all the bears have gone into hibernation.

 2.	Everyone believes “money printing” and “stimulus” creates growth and inflation, even though there is no proof of this happening in Japan, Europe, the US or anywhere else for the last 13 years.


 3.	Magic crayons and market fundamentals agree that this rally has gotten way ahead of itself.

 a.	There is a massive RSI divergence between the top back in Feb 2020 and the 2021 top.

  b.	Valuations are pricing in perfection for nearly every company for the foreseeable future.

**Okay, genius. I’ve heard it all before. Jay Powell has our back, bulls have nothing to fear.**

Does he, really? The Wall Street narrative is “don’t fight the Fed”, and it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the (in)famous “Greenspan put”. How many of you actually paid attention back in Feb-March? Jpow didn’t just fire one bazooka and made everything fine. He needed multiple tries, and for a while there, the market did NOT care one bit what he did to rates or what insane number he pulled out of his ass for Super-QE. When the bears had exhausted themselves and passive flows started saving the day, the narrative changed into “Fed saves the day, once again”, and there was much rejoicing.

**But QE is creating a wave of liquidity, “sloshing around”, propping up stocks! The financial media told me so!**

As many of the less retarded members of this subreddit may have noticed by now, the financial media is not your friend, and they have no idea what they’re talking about most of the time. It’s all talking points they get from their favorite Wall Street or Fed sources. 

What if I told you the whole “money printing” thing was just a lie? Because it is, and demonstrably so. Sure, the Federal Reserve prints money. They print physical money. The US currently has about 1.5 trillion, or roughly 7% or the M2 Money stock (M2 is what the Fed tries to tell you is the actual amount of US dollars in circulation).

So, what is QE, if it’s not money printing? QE is the central bank buying treasuries and other liquid assets from primary dealers. Do they pay for these with money? No. They credit the value in bank reserves, so the bank may lend against the value (which they already could when they held treasuries). So the entire world want US treasuries, one of the most liquid assets in the world, and one of the most popular assets for repo collateral. The primary dealers sell these assets to the central banks to secure their balance sheets and make room for… More treasuries. What happens to the bank reserves? They stay in the central bank, and can be used as a basis for lending.

So – the banks can lend a lot more then – that means they lend money to hedge funds and other investors, and the money is put into markets! The Fed saved us after all! QE really works!! Well, [this graph](https://imgur.com/mvy8m8A) doesn’t really fit that narrative. The massive spike in 2020 is companies maxing out their revolving loans to brace for impact. Like in 2008, lending has been negative every month since the height of the crisis.

Okay, so what if the Fed isn’t really printing money. The government is clearly conjuring up money out of thin air and airdropping them to the people!

Well, they certainly are increasing their debt and spending the money on “stimulus”. I think the word is fairly misleading though. Are you “stimulating spending” if you give a homeless guy $10? Because that, for me, is the equivalent of what the government is doing. They are trying to prevent a disaster, not trying to “stimulate” growth. The gap between where we would have been without covid19 and where we actually is, is a lot bigger than a measly couple of trillion.
 
Some perspective on the “recovery” so far: https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi 

What the government is doing is trying to help people be a bit less miserable, not going out and boosting GDP to new heights. It sure doesn’t seem like the money they are giving out is actually increasing consumer spending in either case: https://imgur.com/FsE9Tsv

**But, but… Vaccines! Pent-up demand! Reflation! Dollar to zero!**

Vaccines are coming, and thank God for that. Is that really going to make the American economy explode (in a good way) though? It surely doesn’t seem like it outside the stock market. Last summer everyone were talking about how amazing Q4 would be. In Q4 everyone were talking about how amazing 2021 would be. Now people are starting to realize that 2021 probably won’t be so amazing after all, at least not until Q3-Q4. By the end of the summer, people will be talking about 2022. Noticed how nobody’s talking about a V-shaped recovery anymore? A recovery would indicate that we got back to where we started, and even though we had “insane” numbers of a quarter, we are nowhere near where we started back in February (which was already quite anemic compared to pre-2008 growth):

https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi

https://imgur.com/ROZuu7d

Lastly, about that pent-up demand. I fail to see it. Leisure makes up roughly 6% of GDP. Sure, people will start eating out again, they will go to amusement parks, they will get haircuts and pedicures, but will you make up for what you didn’t spend on it last year? 4 haircuts a month? 5 trips to Disney World? Eating out 8 days a week? The money has already been spent on RVs, computers, consoles, home remodeling and kitchen appliances. If anything, people might be spending less on these things than they did before covid. Evidence also points to Americans becoming more frugal and saving more to weather the next storm. I think “reopening” and vaccines will be a non-event.

**Okay, I got this far. Why now? Why can’t we get SPY 400? 500?**
 
Warning. Magic crayons ahead. Consider yourself warned.

This is the S&P back in 2018:

https://imgur.com/66Prpwa

Notice how the RSI falls while the price increases? This is called divergence. It is considered a fairly reliable signal that something is amiss. The market made a new low, but the RSI didn’t? Better sell your puts and consider buying calls. The market made a new high, but the RSI didn’t? Vice versa. Some of you might happen what came next, but here is a picture:
 
https://imgur.com/E0C005O

Okay, not conviced? I get it. Here is the S&P early last year:

https://imgur.com/vXuZaCQ

I probably don’t have to tell you what came next, but you can clearly see it on the final graph:

https://imgur.com/ASdHAtx

Notice anything else? Exactly. The market is soaring once again. The RSI? Not so much. Make of it what you will.
If you look closely at the last picture, you will see that the S&P over the last week has gone from sitting comfortably on top of the 21 day moving average, to falling through. On Friday, we closed below the 50 day moving average. That was my cue for loading up 🌈🐻 style. If we close above the 50d on Monday, I will cover and wait for another signal. I don’t have the time to cover passive flows now, that will have to wait – what you need to know if you load up on short term puts, is to get rid of everything before Friday Feb 19. The last week of the month is not a good time to be a bear, because dumb money is buying every index.",2021-01-31 06:42:03

$AMC $BB and $NOK can wait. Hell we may even have to sacrifice them. The point is none of these other tickers are in such a fundamentally flawed situation. Look at burry’s Twitter. He says GME is a once in a lifetime squeeze that we will likely never see again. And he is right. When shares get called back all hell will break loose.

All other tickers are acting to split our community’s buying power. I get it, we can like many stocks, but we need to REALLY LIKE GME until the end of next week. 

We have them by the balls on GME and every other fake squeeze going on in the market is here to serve as a distraction. Big money knows retail will chase green, so by popping off squeezes on these other tickers they are moving retail funds out of GME. I understand many of you may not like to hear this but this is bigger than us. We need to buy and hold GME if this movement is to succeed. 

I believe mods should hold a forum referendum on the topic of banning anything not GME related for the next week. Too many $AMC $BB $NOK shills are detracting from the cause, many of them are new to our sub. ONLY GME can bring Wall Street to their knees.

The Real Short Squeeze Catalyst - 4Q Earnings🌕🚀,152,l8v1we,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8v1we/the_real_short_squeeze_catalyst_4q_earnings/,122,1612067735.0,"The sole reason to hold GME longer than next week and next month are the 4Q earnings. According to Yahoo Finance GameStop is scheduled to report between 24-29 of **March.**

**Why wait until then?**

easy, usually short squeeze happens when there is a catalyst like acquisition, a new product announcement, or a surprise earning report. GME probably not going to buy or get bought out by someone and they won't announce a new product, but they will announce earnings 2 months from now that has a great chance to surprise EVERYONE.

**What do we know so far about their upcoming earnings?**

We only have information about their holiday sales:

* 4.8% increase in comparable stores sales YOY and 29.6% growth QOQ
* 309% increase in E-Commerce sales, representing 34% of total sales reaching $1.35B.
* Total sales declined 3.1% driven by an 11% decrease in the company store base.
* Australia and New Zealand sales increase 31%

Basically, GameStop closed 11% of the company stores, and still, total sales were down a minor 3.1% while comparable sales increased 4.8%. This means 2 things:

1. Physical stores are still profitable or performing very well.
2. E-Commerce Sales are now making up for the loss of sales of closed stores, leading the way for e-commerce being the main company revenue stream.
3. Covid free countries like Australia and New Zealand are still buying from GameStop helping it penetrate these huge markets.

GME on the 3Q report said that they expect positive comparable sales (which we just saw are probably going to be positive) and finally being profitable.

The key here is PROFITABILITY. GME was profitable only 3 times in the last 12Q ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income)).

In the last 2Q that GME achieved profitability the stock went up.

27.3.20 was the day of announcement:

[https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ](https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ)

The stock gapped up a whopping **16%** before going down.

11.6.19 was another profitable Q announcement:

[https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L](https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L)

The stock gapped up 8.5% after earnings.

**Why is it matter?**

well if the next earning report will be a good surprise we will see the price move up the next day and if the company will show a clear path of profitability for the next years **THE SHORT THESIS WILL BE GONE AND A SHORT SQUEEZE WILL FOLLOW**🚀🚀🚀

The odds of profitability are very high with the management expecting it and E-Commerce sales booming. I conclusion HOLD TILL EARNINGS DONT SALE!!!!!!!!

**TL;DR:** The squeeze will happen when there will be a catalyst, the only catalyst for GME is earnings at the end of March, so hold tight until then and let's get the moneyyyyy🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

*This is not financial advice, do you own DD.*

Positions: 141 stocks at 14$ average price 🚀🚀

Edit: IMHO these earnings are not regular earnings, they are going to talk about profitability and hopefully give guidance to after covid because of the vaccines that give hope for the retailers. But imo the most important thing that can come out of this is if they will say that e-commerce is still rising and is a clear revenue growth stream. When this will happen the Short thesis will vanish and shorts will admit their lose. Untill then I believe HF can stay under water and pay the fees unless an early catalyst will emerge.

I'm just a broke college student with very little to invest. 

Lately, so many people on campus have been asking me how to get involved as this is being discussed in classes. The thing that keeps being brought up is the GME price-tag. Is $300 a lot in the grand scheme of things? No. Is it a lot to a college students $1000 savings? Yes. 

So the answer is to buy tons of AMC, NOK or BB instead because shares are affordable right now.

Does it divide from 🖐🖐🖐 ? No because they don't have the funds for 10 shares of GME in the first place.

However, they do have funds for 10 shares of AMC or whatever the NEXT meme-stock is.

🦍🦍 together strong. These are people that we have the opportunity to make community members for LIFE if we don't bully or scare them away. This only makes the next move even more explosive. 

AMC has value long-term and next week JUST LIKE WSB AS A WHOLE. We need to think about the squeez(es) next week and long term growth my friends.

So yes, buy GME AND HOLD THAT SHIT, but consider some of those cheaper options to bring in new family members.

The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,1583,l8uu76,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8uu76/the_gme_squeeze_will_bring_down_melvin_the_silver/,538,1612067146.0,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

And so, I came, after looking at DFVs current positions again; but after that, I came up with a question - How do big firms like Melvin short over 100% and expect nobody to notice?

Or maybe... perhaps they did expect people to notice. What if Melvin and co. is actually IN on the play?

What if they saw the short interest was very high, close to or above 100% - and came up with the plan to add short positions to increase the short interest to levels that will be picked up and acted on by other firms/retail investors - and trigger a short squeeze... BUT preemptively get out of their short positions, and before they have to report their long positions etc...

Because their newer, unreported positions will be all on the LONG side.

The 'bailout' may have been necessary to increase their long positions further, or perhaps they were caught in the squeeze much faster than they had initially thought.

It could be the biggest bait and switch in (recent) financial history.

The gain porn would be unimaginable.

I've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:

1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.

2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around.

Diamond hands are about holding the nerve when the red starts getting darker. Imagine being in a rocket violently shaking as it leaves earth’s orbit. The shaking is so violent you have ground control telling you to abort. But you don’t.

That’s what you need to prepare for. Those rumours will be heard by your friends than your family, who believe them. But you hold your fucking nerve.

Last weak was them turning the oven on and getting the pan warmed up. This coming weak they will call everything under the sun. The hedgie-bitches may work with their buddies to start making people 401K’s and other funds shrink to nothing and there say it’s your fault. You’re the reason that America is getting bankrupted.

Do your own research and risk management.

TL;DR: The hedge funds and the lawmakers could find a way to get around the law and screw us. They always have and they always will. They have much more means that we do, and only from a probabilistic point of view, we will lose. Can we imagine a scenario where this could happen ?

&#x200B;

I know that what I about to say sounds bearish. I own my part of GME shares since before the first gamma squeeze and I have now pretty nice gains (as many of us do). I agree on the possibility for the price to reach astronomical limits due to the short squeeze. In theory, it could work.

In theory.

You think that because this is the weekend, everything stopped and will resume on Monday like nothing happened ? No. Right now, the hedge funds executives and all their management boards are certainly working on a solution to make legal what happened last week . They are right now trying to find a way to take your shares from you. And for this, they will have the help of many people, people which can be at a very high level of our society. And after this will happen, we will be the one accused of having manipulated the market. And you all know they have near unlimited means to do so. They have the money, they have politics, they have the hardware power. They have everything. You got a taste of it last week with that huge bots attack on Reddit and how they managed to manipulate the market so far.

We have the shares. And we got them legally, in all transparency, with our own and hardly earned money and we have the absolute right to buy some more at the price we want, and to sell them at the price we want.

Sure, the shares, that’s what they want. But what if they find the “legal” way to take it from you ? And worst than that: to take them from you without giving you back at least your initial investment ?

This sounds extreme. But this is what happened in 2008. They took your money and your houses, without giving you anything back. The hedge funds were protected by politics. To big to fail they said…

Well, this week they failed for a second time. What will they do now ? Sorry to say this, but most probably the same thing.

So, do you guys have an idea how they could manage to skirt the law or bypass it ? I do not live in the US, so I do not know how they could do this. If someone has an idea, please share it below.

&#x200B;

I felt I had to write this because since last week and especially since last Friday, the number of people reading reddit and especially WSB increased more than exponentially. Many people want to join this financial fight. Many of them are young (I hope more than 18 at least). Many of them are maybe putting themselves in danger.

So I just wanted to suggest you to think twice before investing all your life savings for this noble cause: will you be in financial danger if they manage to take all your investment from you ? How would you live with this ? Would you still  be able to pay your bills, taxes, and bring food on the table ? Just take a moment to think about this. There is a hight probabillity to lose it all on this.

Personally, I have a broad portfolio. If this happens, I would certainly lose a certain percentage of it. It will take some time to build it again sure… But I will not be in immediate danger (so does Melvin & Co if they lose some more billions by trying to take the price down in vain😊; In theory they will continue this practice until they really start to feel what it looks like to be in danger ; maybe for the first time of their lives ?

This is why I will hold my shares: because I bought them legally and I have the right to sell them at whatever the fucking price I want. I will hold. Because it is legally mine… and also, I just like the stock, it is doing great for me recently...

I just felt I had to write this to show to all lurkers, media, and all, that WSB is not only a forum where we YOLO our savings unconsciously. We are also people who know how to manage our risks and who care about each other.

They provide the DTCC with collateral (usually 1 to 3%) for 2 days which can be called upon in case the broker/hedge fund cannot pay DTCC to settle the trade.

Trades are settled 2 days after the transaction takes place at DTCC level.

If the broker cannot pay up to legally settle the trades 2 days later, the clearing house is on the hook and has to pay up to DTCC.

Because of the volatility and risk of market wide collapse with trades not being able to be cleared with cash, DTCC required that clearing houses put up 100% collateral. This removes risk that the seller of a stock might not get paid cash.

&#x200B;

# DTCC:

They are the guys who replace the old paper exchange of share ownership.

They handle like 95% of all share exchanges and are responsible to ensure the market does not collapse.

Collapse in this case is if a seller does not get paid when they sell a share. This would happen for every stock on the market due to clearing houses not having the money to pay up.

# 

# Now why could you sell but not buy?

Surely the brokers are manipulating the stock to drive the price down?

This is because when you buy a stock, all of the above has already taken place. DTCC is happy that the money is in place in case the stock is sold.

Then when you sell GME, you get paid because the clearing house has already guaranteed the funds to DTCC.

They stopped buying so that the risk of sale default is minimised.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds.

# So what did Robinhood do wrong?

Essentially Robinhood fucked up by allowing so much margin and borrowed funds to retail investors. They ran out of money to front to the clearing house. This is why they limited buys and asked for margin buyers to have 100% cash in the account.

# What about the hedge funds?

Melvin Capital fucked up with the short. They didn't have enough money to cover their positions and buy the high price cover. Citadel therefore bailed them out.

# Why could I buy $GME the next day?

Clearing houses went to banks to get lending for large sums of money so they can provide DTCC with the necessary collateral that they require, this is why the brokers could allow the retail investors to buy the stock again.

# Why did some brokers allow us to buy $GME when others didn't?

Different brokers use different clearing houses. So while one clearing house locked off a broker, the other clearing house may have been fine and not done the calculations yet.

That's why there was kind of a juggling situation between brokers allowing buys and restricting buys.

On Friday T212 did not restrict buys for cash on GME, but they completely restricted CFD on it. This is because they couldn't front the leverage themselves or through their clearing house

# TLDR:

I know we degens don't want to believe it, but the brokers did not have a choice in this.

The clearing houses told the brokers to stop the buying because they didn't have the money to guarantee that you get paid if you sell.

Restricting buying and ONLY allowing selling DID result in a manipulation of the stock price but that wasn't the main reason behind the Clearing Houses forcing the brokers to stop the buying.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds.",2021-01-31 05:47:01

$GME Options: Early Exercising Mid/Long Dated DEEP ITM Call Options is a Hedge Against a Fixed-Equity FED/SEC Bailout and may inadvertently serve as the MOASS catalyst.,159,l8tp9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tp9i/gme_options_early_exercising_midlong_dated_deep/,137,1612064282.0,"Read the title my rocket children. This is not a bear post🚫🏳️‍🌈🐻, just a bull trying to protect himself and maybe others from the suits & feds. 

A few thoughts to consider:

1. *A new major catalyst is probably necessary to trigger a MOASS due to the consequences of point #2*. *Early exercising of deep ITM calls may serve as a major component of that catalyst.* 
2. GME may trade up slowly (short-burn) as shorts bleed and begin to unwind over-time. This now possible because of actions taken by RH and other brokerage against retail investors, to slow upward momentum by halting the buy-side of the trade, thus allowing shorts to reconvene, degross, and reposition.  
3. If GME hits >$1000 we could potentially see some unprecedented FED/SEC intervention in the form of a ""retail-investor friendly"" bailout. I'm not familiar with the legalities and details of how this could actually play out. That being said, if the FED/SEC are concerned about a major market sell-off due to the MOASS, I expected them to strike a fixed-equity deal where all shorted shares must be covered for a fixed value. In this scenario, those with shares will profit bigly; those with calls may be left holding their bag.

I plan to exercise my deep ITM calls on Monday, just to be safe. They have no extrinsic value. Obviously, this only works for those who have the $ to exercise. 

Thoughts?

There needs to be a fair market, if for whatever reason a certain market cannot remain fair, it is halted until it resumes being fair.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The DTCC can only raise cash obligations during, 1) extended hours trading after the regular session has ended or no later than one hour before the regular session begins, or 2)  when the market is closed.
2. No financial instrument can trade only one way. Either you can buy and sell at every brokerage, or neither and it is halted.
3. As a consequence of 2, only the exchanges can limit trading via a halt. There are many different halts that can be used. The three main halts that I think may be the most applicable are T12, H11, and O1 (Note: These are all NASDAQ halts, I cant find a good NYSE list of halts)
   1. T12 - **Additional Information Requested by NASDAQ** 
   2. H11 -  **Regulatory Concern**
   3. O1 **-**  **Operations Halt, Contact Market Operations** 
4. When the DTCC decides to raise cash obligations, if a clearing house cannot meet its new cash obligation in time of market open, it is deemed as a major risk and the DTCC will tell the exchanges to halt trading for that security until all clearing houses can meet the new cash obligation.
5. If a clearing house is unable to meet the obligation, the brokerages using that clearing house have the right to supplement clearing for that asset through a different clearing house. This will allow trading to resume even if a clearing house cannot meet it's cash obligations for that asset.
6. The DTCC needs to have a significant cash reserve on hand ready to lend to clearing houses that cannot meet the obligation requirements. This will decrease the likely hood that trading gets halted.
7. The DTCC is only allowed to loan its cash reserves at or below the Risk-Free Interest Rate.
8. Any brokerage and clearing house that allows a short sale to occur once the Short Interest reaches 100% of Float shall receive a monetary fine equal to 2x the market value of that trade.
9. No single trading body, institutional or retail,  can be short more that 5% of Float for more than 48 hours past the start of the next regular session.
10. Failure to comply with rule 9 results in a monetary fine for the trader/institution equal to the market value of the size of the short position which is above the 5% limit.",2021-01-31 05:33:45

Tried it with three different bank accounts. No dice. It either gave me a ""server error"" message, or it told me that a bank had to be verified.

At this point I'm getting bad vibes, try to post my screenshot (still pending with the mods), and leave it for a minute. Come back later on my PC and try again. No dice. Then, I think, well, let's try it with $100 instead of $600.

And it lets me withdraw.

OK, we'll try a bigger number.

Nope.

Now I'm sus, so I fire up OBS studio and screen record all of this shit as I go through and attempt to get it to let me withdraw any amount larger than $100. Nothing larger than $100 can withdraw, but $100 (and presumably lower) can. I kept going right up until I run out of daily withdrawals.

It looks to me very much like **Robinhood is limiting withdrawals to $100 or less and pretending it's a server error.**

This can't possibly be legal, and I don't know how it could be a server error. I'm not as strong on comp sci as I used to be, but 100 is a fucking int and 600 is a fucking int and they're both three digits and should require the exact same amount of computational power to transact/calculate/whatever.

Again, I have screenshots from my phone, and I took a screen recording as I went through and did this on my PC. Can anyone advise whether it is 1) possible that it is indeed a server error, or 2) if not, how it could possibly be legal? Cause like I said it still fucking looks to me like they're just not allowing us to get our money out.

Theory of Current Market Conditions (DD),160,l8tjgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tjgh/theory_of_current_market_conditions_dd/,110,1612063868.0,"**TL;DR** High short % stocks are **nuclear bombs** going off that are sucking capital out of the market into the mushroom clouds that are currently ascending into the stratosphere. Read further for more details on this retarded theory.

**Disclaimer**: I’m retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.

So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.

Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of 💎✊ retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

This DD needs a lot more attention. 

Ima keep this simple. The following DD posted by u/fyzle deserves more attention than it's been getting. It's simple, clear and common sense. 

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded. 

They do not lose money. Period. 

Citadel, Melvin and Citron are nothing compared to the might of just Blackrock alone. Throw in Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, Susquehana Capital and a bunch of others (see link), and you quickly realize that shorts don't have a leg to stand on. 

Autists prepare for take off.🧑🏻‍🚀🧑🏼‍🚀🧑🏽‍🚀🧑🏾‍🚀🧑🏿‍🚀

The narrative you’ll hear is that Robinhood placed limits on certain orders to mitigate your risk.,162,l8te7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8te7d/the_narrative_youll_hear_is_that_robinhood_placed/,75,1612063480.0,"We all know that’s bullshit. But WHY do we know that’s bullshit? 

Well, if you’re new to investing there’s a concept called margin. Margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with. They still “own” whatever you buy with it, but you’re allowed to take profits on how you use it, paying them back with interest once you’ve made gains. If you’re not making gains, they’ll sell your stuff for you and you’ll be responsible for making up the loss.

A while back, people in financial circles were freaking out because of the “influx of you inexperienced investors trading on margin”, thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing. Of course that’s not true, because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses. What might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do. It’s hypocrisy incarnate. You’re on the hook for your margin losses, or any cash losses. They’re trying to get hedge funds OFF the hook for theirs.

Here’s the thing though. Almost ANYONE could get an ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF MARGIN.

Unemployed college students and $40k/year average people were given thousands, often tens of thousands, dollars of credit to trade with. These are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from. Loans your bank would never give you. RH didn’t give a shit, because they don’t give a shit about your risk.

Once people realized buying GME with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money, they started “caring about your risk”. They’re not limiting your risk. They’re limiting your GAINS that you’d earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data. 

“Risk with a high likelihood of downside? Have at it. Risk with almost surefire insanely high upside? We’re gonna have to step in. “

Edit to add: yes, there’s also the (probably more impactful) reality that they likely didn’t have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades. My main point is that it’s SURE AS HELL not to minimize YOUR risk.",2021-01-31 05:24:40

A Practical Guide to 💎🙌,230,l8tdq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tdq3/a_practical_guide_to/,132,1612063444.0,"**TLDR**; taking on huge risk and betting everything makes you more prone to paper handing your position at the slightest red. Be smart about your position and your profits. 🦍🦍 💪💪, GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Alright retards, put on your helmet and take that crayon out of your nose because it's time to get serious. 

Diamond handing is important. It's been the most important part of our strategy, no doubt. The concept's easy, but this volatility is enough to age us all 40 years. Not everyone, especially the newer people, are capable of stomaching these drops, so I'd like to offer a more practical (more realistic maybe) guide to diamond handing. At the very least, this guide will help you be more confident in your positions and greatly decreasing your odds of being a little bitch that sells at the first sign of red. 

&#x200B;

**If you're just joining us now and bought any of the hyped stocks at current prices or higher:**  


1. **Educate yourself.** You bought a stock, which is ownership of a company. Understand the fundamentals behind what your company. DD is not something WSB is lacking in. You have a searchbar. You have eyes. (I mean, unless you don't. That's cool too. Have someone read you DD out loud like a bedtime story. :) ) I really like [this DD on Gamestop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) if you want to learn some more about Gamestop. I don't know (and don't care) about any of the other stocks, so you're on your own. **Educate yourself on the company you own a portion of and you'll be less prone to paper hand.** 
2. **Don't sell at a loss.** It's just retarded. Fear is one of the worst human emotions and you'll never make money in the market if you're scared of a little red. So if you can't stand that you're down 10% on a stock that swings 50% a day, why did you buy it in the first place? Similarly, if you're down 50% on a stock, it makes no sense to sell it when it pretty much can only go up from there. This isn't to say that stop loss isn't important but I feel like I'll do more harm by trying to explain to you retards on when to use it. So for now, while the hype is still there, just hold. 
3. **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Don't overleverage. Don't use margin. Seriously, if you're struggling to put food on the table and your last $10 are in AMC like a retard, this game really isn't for you. The reason is that you're so scared for your money that you will make the worst possible decisions at the worst time and lose that money. Don't underestimate fear and desperation. This isn't just a get rich quick scheme. 
4. **When you're up bigly, congratulations!** You win. Follow the advice for OGs. 

&#x200B;

**If you're an OG and bought Gamestop when it was double digits:**  


1. **Congratulations you big chad! :)**
2. **Consider taking a little bit of profit.** If you bought Gamestop at like $12, you are up bigly, no doubt, but it can be extremely nerve wrecking to watch your portfolio erase three years of your Wendy's salary in an hour and so you can be prone to paper handing. It will really be much easier if you sell a tiny portion of your shares to at least cover the initial deposit. That way, if Gamestop goes down to $0 (when hell freezes over, but you never know), you at least break even. It'll be easier to sleep at night. I mean, even Deepfuckingvalue does it. Be smart about it. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, it's hard to diamond hand consistently if you have trouble sleeping at night due to how overleveraged you are. It's like a diet fad. The chad that limits himself by 100 calories but sticks to it consistently will do better than the retard trying to fast 72 hours when he's never gone 30 minutes without a sugar donut.

Is there a legitimate case for a AMC short squeeze as people are expecting (Not much AMC DD around),235,l8tczt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8tczt/is_there_a_legitimate_case_for_a_amc_short/,340,1612063393.0,"Mods: I would have asked this question in the Weekend Discussion, but I haven't seen one for a while so forgive me.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for purely educational learning purposes.*

I have some serious questions about AMC. I am concerned about the fact that the floating shares just increased because AMC let Silver Lake dump $600 million worth of shares to remove their debt. The short volume was 42mil shorted shares to 52mil floated shares in Jan 15 (last date from Marketbeat) but now I believe it will be 42mil shorted to 96mil floated shares next week. Unless the shorts are dumb enough to short those shares instead of covering, we might have an issue with the ""inevitable"" short squeeze. Unfortunately AMC doesn't have the same ""guaranteed"" short squeeze as GME.

I am wondering what everyone else thinks about the situation?

My Position: 1050 shares at $4.30

Keep in my mind I got in before the Reddit hype and right after AMC announced that they have secured enough funding to be free from the dangers of bankruptcy. I figured that by summer time as moviegoers rush to the theaters, by Q2 earnings, AMC would be trading at $6-7. I never in my wild dreams though that it would be trading almost 3x my cost basis one week after I got in lol.

$GME Endgame - Game Theory & Best Scenarios,4690,l8t3dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/,1033,1612062701.0,"For those confused why BUY and HOLD are the investors best strategy - both to stick it to hedge funds and profit - this post is to map this out.

**HEDGEFUND RISK**

First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds.  [According to S3 analytics,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far.  Other reports have come out that [hedge funds have lost 15-20% of assets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month#:~:text=Dan%20Sundheim's%20D1%20Capital%20Partners,target%20hedge%20funds'%20favorite%20positions) so far this year.  Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here ([Citadel was worth $33B on Jan. 1st](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=We%20achieve%20far%20more%20together%20than%20we%20ever%20could%20on%20our%20own.&text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20January%201%2C%202021) so I believe this to be close).  Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal, we can assume they are all in this together.  This prevents a [prisoners dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,expense%20of%20the%20other%20participant) for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs. say an individual worth $2B.

Now let's assume short amount is 100% of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics.  This means to calculate daily interest we take:

* 50M shares in float ([according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* 25% interest rate = .25/365 = .07%/day
* Share Price = $300

$300\*.07%\*50M = $10.2M in interest/day.

At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum # of shares needed they can keep this up for ***21 years.***

*So that's their situation.  The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going?*

&#x200B;

**HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY**

Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others.  You need ***shares*** and ***you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere***\*.\*  How do you do this?

There are three tactics likely:

1.	Settlement

* Let's go back to our shares needed (50M) and value of the hedge funds ($80B).  Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt.
* To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500-$1000/share
* So how would you do this?  You first use your friends to [convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1355329408194719748).  Retail investors might even have an organization like [SEC say they are protecting us](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/sec-vows-protect-retail-investors-amid-gamestop-frenzy-n1256146) \- after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid.  You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is! *(fuckers)*
* This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it
* Edit: As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares, not just government intervention 

&#x200B;

2A) Test Pricing - Low

* The first test they did was to see if they could scare us.  A [ladder attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/) costs them nothing.  And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options.
* Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until \~2:30pm (I'll explain why later).  I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range

&#x200B;

2B) Test Pricing - High

* Another strategy is to find a [price cliff](https://www.pricebeam.com/pricingpsychology#:~:text=A%20Price%20Cliff%20can%20be,share%20and%20revenue%20will%20drop).  Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits.  This is more risky and will be used cautiously.
* However I can't state this enough - **we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell.**

&#x200B;

3) Work with GME to Issue Shares

* If they think buying is dying down, a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit
* The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold: Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors
* Still, keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point

&#x200B;

Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht.  Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks.  This can't go tits up.

*Wrong.  Retail Investors still have the power.*

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY**

So now you are a smooth-brained ape.  What can you do to stick it to the twats?

&#x200B;

1.	HOLD

* If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares.  This leads to a long, drawn out fight or settlement.  But guess what - at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks
* This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short-term gains become long-term gains (less taxes)

&#x200B;

2) BUY

* How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price?  You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price!
* Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon. RIs had two days where buying was diminished (fuck Robinhood) and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed.  Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes (maybe thanks to a whale)
* If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP
* ***This is the most important though - the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a ""dip"".***  ***Price is now pre-squeeze and post-squeeze***
* If they can do this the retail investor wins.  The post-squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell (hopefully VERY HIGH) and all shares purchased post-squeeze will make profit

&#x200B;

3) FIND WHALES

* Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers?

&#x200B;

4) DO IT QUICKLY

* HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out.  The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING - WHAT TO EXPECT**

Now that we understand that what will winning look like?  Well we have two outcomes:

&#x200B;

1.	Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts

* This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power
* The price will gamma squeeze, then squeeze, and then game is over
* Watch for massive market dips

&#x200B;

2) Retail Investors Own All The Shares

* While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares
* A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell  - imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share
* After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be (again hopefully VERY HIGH)
* EDIT: THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY.  IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100% OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

* Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell
* The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD.
* A successful retail investor strategy ***eliminates the idea that there is ""a dip"" to create a buying wall.***  There is only pre-squeeze and post-squeeze prices.
* A buying wall - supported by a swath of limited order buys - by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over
* One well-intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared
* Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on

I know for the fact that it's going to be my biggest ""wisha woulda shoulda coulda"" regret I will be telling my grand children in future.

I watched the whole $GME saga from sidelines for past couple months and I am happy for all you retards making banks.

It's just my 30K annual salary, my stupid ass risk appetite and ever lasting debt doesn't allow me to hop on a 300$ a share price at this point. (I am in \~15K debt to be clear). Have nearly 1000$ worth spread out in $AMC $BB $NOK just because you retards suggested it and I wanted to be with you guys on (somewhat possibly) next rocket.

My rational mind tells me the $GME price's gonna go up 1000$+ mark and my ""woulda shoulda coulda"" is gonna get more intensified. But, my convicted mind tells me to keep watching from sidelines and support my fellow autistic retard buddies.

I just want to speak out one thing loud and clear to all the guys who got in at no matter what price. Just keep on Holding for your Dear Life.

All the GME left-outers love to watch the game and see hedge funds getting burned. Just burn 'em all.

The feelings of selling my grandpa's hand-made 30 year old house back in 2008 crisis and living on rent in a basement for next 5-7 years still burns my heart to ashes each time I think about it. I was a small kid back then but now I understand all of it. Every single thing.

Let me clear up some misinformation: market makers don’t buy shares all at once on Friday when the calls expire in the money; that would be fucking stupid. In simple terms, they buy as the chance of the call ending in the money rises (aka the stock price goes up), so they buy slowly on the days leading up to the expiration date. Their problem is that there is not enough liquidity in the market to have bought enough shares properly when those calls get exercised on Tuesday. 

Next week is going to be the biggest week in my opinion. And if they didn’t close robinhood, we would be gamma squeezed up to 700-800 by now or even more. But they did illegal shit to get away with it, and delayed the inevitable. Our friends at robinhood will have hopefully liquidated and switched brokers by Monday and set off the gamma squeeze paired with the call exercises on Tuesday and MM’s not having enough shares hedged properly to deliver. My opinion. 


You know the reason why they didn’t try that short naked ladder attack like they did that drive the price from 480 to 120 again yesterday??? Because we didn’t fucking sell. It wasn’t low enough for them to close very many short positions.

Looking at volume, at 120, nobody fucking sold. People probably bought the dip and took more shares off the market instead. They know that, that’s why they didn’t try to use it to bring the price to 120 again yesterday, and only kept it in the 250 ish range. that moment made me FUCKING TRUST YOU GUYS SO MUCH. The fact that MAJORITY STILL DID NOT SELL IS UNBELIEVABLE. They’re probably thinking the same thing. 

They’re literally shitting their pants. They have every professional risk analyst, Harvard data scientist, Harvard mathematicians, and the best financial analysts in the world working on this. 

Unless the SEC or FED step in (I don’t think the SEC will: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html) They have no choice but to make us sell— and the only way they are going to do this is by psychologically torturing us until we do it. Bots spamming shit, robinhood cancelling, CNBC spreading fucking fear everywhere, short naked ladder attacks. 





TLDR ⁺ THE ANSWER? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Turn your fucking brain OFF. trust the process. Ignore EVERYTHING you see that comes from the media, and more importantly don’t let any fluctuations in the price faze you, IT IS ALL ARTIFICIAL DESPERATE ATTEMPTS AT SURVIVING. Trust the fact that these shitheads are working literally this next 48 hour weekend straight and sweating and screaming and crying and begging for bailouts, and meeting behind closed doors to come up with more shitty tactics, which won’t work on us because were NEVER FUCKING SELLING. We sit at home with the shares jerking off and spending our time chilling, while they’re in emergency overdrive mode. The fact that we have RETAIL INVESTORS who are willing to lose the money to prove a point, and are not scared, and don’t understand that much is ACTUALLY OUR BIGGEST ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW. 

IMPORTANT:

don’t get burnt out or they WIN. I watch the ticker all day from 8 to 5:30. It’s so draining and I cannot keep it up forever WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. come Monday, I am not looking at the stock until 1. I’m going to exercise, eat healthy shit, drink water, spend time with the family and set some time aside NOT thinking about GME. The exact thing they want is that we lose momentum or get stressed out and sell to ease our mind. Don’t let them win. 


I own GME, this is purely speculation, I don’t know anything for certain, and it is all my opinion. I like the stock, and believe in its fundamentals and leadershiP.


 E D I T: THINKING ABOUT NOT LEAVING Robinhood yet for one reason or another? 

Copied from my response to a comment below about someone saying it would take too long to liquidate and move to robinhood: 

Don’t liquidate your GME holdings, just take your extra cash you want to put in to GME and put it in another broker account ASAP. 

Robinhood is completely controlled by the person we’re fighting against. When we had momentum yesterday, they changed the 5 share buy max to 2 then to 1. They will always kill momentum because they are owned by the people we are fighting against. They will never allow you to buy again. 

In my opinion you should have switched brokers the moment this news came out. I think you can get it set up for Tuesday which I believe will be the biggest day. Letting us by 5 then 2 then 1 share? They have professional analysts; they know the limit that can be bought for them to be successful; and they can control the buying limit. if they can do this; they are basically guaranteed a win. They are controlled by the big guys, you have to get OUT.",2021-01-31 05:05:32

Melvin and others who are doing the ladder shorts, scaring a few to get shares but not enough to save themselves.  Ive read that Melvin and others are paying 3% daily interest on their shorts. 

Lets assume a $1B short that went against them to the tune of $10B in losses. They are effectively paying 3% or $300M a day to maintain that short. Only they can't get out because there are no true sellers, just bullshit ladder games by other shorters. Eventually Melvin cannot pay that $300M ($1.5B a week) margije requirement. The price increases and their short goes red $20B, now they have $600M a day to carry the short. Just can't continue.  

So they become insolvent, and a bigger firm assumes the risk of their short. GME hits $10K a share and now that bigger firm has a $3B a day margin risk! They go down. 

Two ways this works out for the shorts, 1, enough people cash out so they can cover. 2 Gamestop themselves sell massive shares into the frenzy. They get to Cohen and he releases millions of shares, GME files an action to raise capital to restructure and sells 100M shares to do that (directly to hedges at a predetermined price so they can cover).

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME!! I am one of you guys!"", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

I have personally been reading and participating in WSB since we were around 600K strong.  Seeing the explosive growth here recently) is unreal.

The media coverage is also unreal.  Unfortunately, some are painting the group as a monolithic entity -- a raging, disgraceful mob bent on destruction.

Sure - some of the language here is obscene and the culture is undeniably childish.  But let me tell you some of the stuff I've seen:

&#x200B;

\*Multiple stories of members who have used profits to buy Nintendos for children's hospitals, food for health care workers, donations to charities, etc.  This has happened many times before when members made large profits on other positions.  How many hedge fund managers would have done the same had they bankrupted GME?

\*A doctor (maybe a surgeon?) had a long-standing position on $AMD and made a significant profit.  He posted about it one day and folks were jokingly asking for money  (the typical ""hi, it's me your son...."" approach).  One person mentioned they were a medical student with a huge amount of loans.  The doctor contacted him personally, gave him advice, and helped with $ for loans.

\*Recently, a gentleman living in his car posted how he had placed $600 on GME call options now worth >$100,000.  The mantra here has been hold, hold, hold with anyone selling facing the potential of a relentless onslaught of insults.  In in this case, countless members encouraged him to cash out at least some of the position to afford housing, food, and warmth.  Countless posts of support and well wishes.  

\*Likewise, folks posted support and congratulatory messages for someone who was able to secure some profits and buy delayed christmas presents that were unobtainable.  The sheer joy in his post and his newfound ability to bring happiness to others was heartwarming.

\*Countless posts of support.  While everyone here messes around with everyone else, there is actually a really nice undercurrent where when someone is in real trouble, there is countless outpouring of support.

&#x200B;

Now - with countless bots and new accounts with unclear motives, these types of things are harder to find.

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years. Let that sink in.

Edit: This blew up, appreciate all the support!

I recently saw this video, it's 10 minutes long, but the ***first 3 are incredibly important!***  
***Jim Cramer*** exposes what illegal activities hedge funds and short sellers do to manipulate the market. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4&t=2s) . They literally take advantage of the SEC not knowing what they do.

WELL GME isn’t technically speculation. Historically when more than 100% of a stock is shorted and people hold the stock when shorts are forced to buy back, PRICE GOES UP.

This isn’t speculation. I have a 3rd grade reading level but that makes sense to me somehow.

They’re horrible at executing orders, can’t close spreads with more than two legs, constantly glitching and make stupid mistakes like forgetting to code in leap year. Throughout the years they’ve made enough blunders and whenever that happened people got mad and swore to move out but a lot of them ended up staying because other broker apps (so far) all look much more complicated and make people especially novice traders feel at a loss. 

RH is like a pretty girl with an empty head, she’s easy to use but so stupid sometimes you just want to dump her but damn she’s got a sexy body you can’t let go.

Luckily design is much easier to replicate. All we need is a new trading app that looks similar in layout but runs with a better system and integrity, like a lady that’s beautiful with brains. It will be only a matter of time before people move on and dump this stupid pos.

AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

TLDR; AAPL going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz I said so.

Increasing GME'S Value as a Brand,103,l8s35c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8s35c/increasing_gmes_value_as_a_brand/,72,1612060126.0,"Brand valuation depends on what customers will pay for a brand name, minus the cost of product.

The question is, how much more will people pay for GameStop branded merchandise, compared
to a month ago.

GameStop's value is in that it represents rebellion and a striving for fairness- not only from the original short interest, but even more from the media and hedgies blaming retain investors.

Perhaps a stock price of $100 isn't sustainable, but $50 may be.

And this would still obliterate the hedgies, as their positions would still cost them 10-15 x their shorts, and 50-100x the calls they sold.

And if GameStop could demonstrate the legitimacy of this valuation, it would prevent SEC shenanigans that release short interest of their obligations.

ITT we brainstorm what products GameStop could brand, with the cache of their brand.
My vote is a GameStop-branded BlackBerry phone, specializing in simple games, or a unique social chat app.

Here are some others, not my own:

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.


Sorry for my bad English.


Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.

I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)


So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.


Backstory:


I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.


So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.


So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.


In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.


Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.


But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.


Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.



The Beer Virus Crash:


I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.


The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.


Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".


After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..


Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. 


And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them


You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.


GME and the global movement:


And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.


So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.


A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.


I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.


So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.


Let's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!


TLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.

Whales to Watch: Week of 2/1 🐳 🪓,193,l8roem,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8roem/whales_to_watch_week_of_21/,119,1612059070.0,"**EDITOR NOTE**: YES. GME NOK AND AMC have incredibly strong volume still, followed by BB/BBY

In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here’s the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

🐳🧐**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) 🚀🚀🚀: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[Unusual whales confirmation: look at this March call order](https://i.imgur.com/nQ6WcFN.jpg)

[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) 🚀🚀: consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: strong 2/5 call block ](https://i.imgur.com/H7onSWz.jpg)

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) 🚀🚀: lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: repeated weeklies each week, such as this. ](https://i.imgur.com/imHvK1O.jpg)

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) 🚀🚀🚀: the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) 🚀 : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

[Unusual Whales spotted this INTC call block got 2/5](https://i.imgur.com/aRBlrRY.jpg)

**Tech grab bag:**

**ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY**
EDIT: I forgot AMD

 **All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.** Very bullish call flow.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** /u/lordofoptions has sold me on **SENS**

Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.

**Inbox always open**: i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.

**TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that.**
good luck. 🐳",2021-01-31 04:11:10

Current float is like 50.65M ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)) so that means if 9.25M shares get assigned, 18% of float will now change hands as a result.

Where the hell was this staunch worship of fundamentals when shorts were borrowing against gamestop to 140% in an effort to push the price down on an equity that quite literally reached a price to book ratio of 0.40? These fucking idiots harp on about fundamentals, but don't have anything to say about a hedge fund exposing itself 10x over to try and push a stock down further than literally less than it's liquidated cash/inventory value.

Similarly, where was this concern for an exit strategy when those same hedge fund shorts were sitting at huge profits? Why didn't they take profits? Where was this concern for an exit strategy when the stock turned a corner and new boardmembers were appointed? Where was the exit strategy when Melvin, Citron, Etc lost 100% of their position, or 200%, or 500%. Where was the exit strategy when they got bailed out for 2 billion and still doubled down on the position? Where was the exit strategy when they quite literally put our equity markets on the verge of a liquidity crisis?

These fucking hypocritical idiots love to throw these things around now that one of the worst trades in history went sideways on them. Where were all these values and disciplines when they made their idiotic trade? Why didn't their prime broker force an exit strategy on them? I sure as shit know my broker would have stepped in a lot sooner. Why didn't theirs? Did their idiotic broker not realize that in a functioning market they are ultimately the last buck and bagholders in this if Melvin becomes insolvent?

Everything about this from their idiotic trade to their response smells like total bullshit.

PS: I LIKE GME AND AMC AND IM NOT SELLING

My risk tolerance on this position is infinite. Collectively we have extremely diversified and pooled risk across literally millions of people throwing a few hundred or thousand bucks at the thing. The dumb fucks on the other side of this trade have miniscule risk tolerance, massive leverage, and extremely concentrated positions that risk entire hedge funds. No matter how much they try to convince us that we're in a dangerous position, the absolute worst thing that happens to us is we each lose some bullshit money in a diversified loss spread across literally millions of people. All of whom will sleep soundly at night knowing we fought a good fight. The idiots on the other side of this trade stand to lose their oligarchy. They stand to lose entire hedge funds on the behalf of other billionaires who were too lazy to read the prospectus of the hedge fund that just lost tons of their money.

Defending Your Tendies From the SEC,36,l8r9wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8r9wc/defending_your_tendies_from_the_sec/,108,1612058074.0,"This has nothing to do with share price, so if you don’t care about going to jail or losing all your tendies to a civil suit, scroll past this. This won't apply to most of you, but it probably applies to *some* of you.

Alright morons, listen up. Law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while. There are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are, or have been, making moves with GME/the other meme stocks right now. These issues range from civil to criminal, so you should probably read this. I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom if words are hard for you.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First of all, I am *not* an attorney (yet), and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all. **You should talk to a real lawyer** if you think you might need legal advice. More on that below.

I’m going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things I’ve seen on wsb as of late, and if it sounds like you, **go talk to a lawyer.**

* ""The opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers. Even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets."" Christine Souhrada, Securities Fraud, Market Manipulation, and the Internet, UCLA J.L. & Tech., 2002, at Notes 28

What that means in tendie-speak is that the SEC can come after *you* for some combination of your posts, comments and trades. This doesn’t mean they *will*, just that they *can.* Note: The SEC has an [Office of Internet Enforcement](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm). Just because this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the memes are good, you're not immune from real-world problems.

The SEC is not the only source of potential problems. They coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies. I’m not going to explain the law & procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you, because i'm fond of you, but not *that* fond. Also, like I mentioned above, you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesn't rise to the level of criminal.

The key to what the SEC calls market manipulation is ""causing enough investors to buy the target company's stock by disseminating **false information** to artificially inflate the stock price. *Id.* (See the above-referenced legal journal, that's what '*Id.'* means) This also applies to artificially deflating (by disseminating false information) if you hold a short position or a put, etc; this is the apparent business model of funds like Melvin, and yes, they should be the ones being looked at, but *should* doesn’t matter and I'm writing this for you, not them.

If you’ve gotten caught up in the hype and memes, and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon GME, you need to talk to a lawyer **now**. I can’t tell you if what you’ve said is false or not, but a real lawyer can. The lynchpin of liability (tendie-speak: whether you have a problem on your hands) is the making of material misstatements or omissions to induce investors to purchase securities. See §17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Here are some examples of people getting in to the crosshairs of the SEC via some of the above-described behavior:

* **S.E.C. v. Simmons**, 8:04-CV-2477-T-17MAP, 2008 WL 7935266 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2008)

Stock promoter acted with severe recklessness in predicting that a company's stock prices would rise to at least S15.00, yet selling his stock for a third of the price, which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Therefore, promoter engaged in securities fraud. Despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his enthusiasm for the company's future prospects, there was no evidence submitted, besides seller's deposition testimony, that the postings were pre-qualified with a cautionary statement warning potential investors to consider.

* **S.E.C. v. Masri**, 523 F. Supp. 2d 361, 365–66 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)

Defendants purchased 200,000 TZA shares on August 20, 1999, in order to push the price of TZA above $5, thus causing the TZA August 5 put options to expire worthless and avoid the required purchase of 860,000 shares at $5 per share

SDNY Court held that if an investor conducts an open-market transaction with the intent of artificially affecting the price of the security, and not for any legitimate economic reason, it *can*constitute market manipulation.

    “B-b-b-but I only relied on publicly available information!!11!”  

* Yeah, well, so did this guy: **Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Fiore**, 416 F. Supp. 3d 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) Promoter's reliance on corporation's public filings did **not** allow him to get out of the action filed against him by the SEC.

&#x200B;

    “Nothing I did moved prices, I’m too small!” 

* Still a potential problem. **FindWhat Inv'r Group v. FindWhat.com**, 658 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2011) Finding that confirmatory information that wrongfully prolongs a period during which stock is traded at inflated prices, even without increasing the level of inflation, may be actionable under the securities laws; that is, defendants may be liable for knowingly and intentionally causing a stock price to remain inflated by preventing preexisting inflation from dissipating from the stock price. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, § 10(b), 15 U.S.C.A. § 78j(b)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, if, after all of this, you find yourself several orders of magnitude richer than you were at the start: **TELL NO ONE. TALK  TO A TRUSTS AND ESTATES ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY.** I’m sure you’re aware of the issues that lotto winners find themselves dealing with. If you’ve struck gold and are swimming in tendies, you are effectively a lotto winner, which means you are now a target. Even well-meaning people will try to help you spend your tendies. You need to retain counsel to figure out how you’re going to protect yourself from others.

"$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB",1226,l94t1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94t1a/nok_is_almost_certainly_a_plant_gme_is_the_most/,490,1612097184.0,"Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either. 

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

My psychological strategy to holding stock,446,l99h5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l99h5f/my_psychological_strategy_to_holding_stock/,171,1612116263.0," Hello, everyone. **I really like stocks**. But everything didn't start out like that. Back in September when I made my first investment, I lost about $50 x 100 shares. Bought TSLA at 440 and sold out at 390 with paper hands and panic selling. Look at its stock price now.

After that, I vowed to myself I would never sell stock again. I needed a strategy. Something that would help me pull through psychologically and hold. At that time, as well, the NIO rocket ship was still boarding to the moon. I bought in at $27. Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind. It was at that time that ***I had suddenly began to jack off about 3 times a day*** (it used to only be once a day). Once at the beginning of premarket, once at market open, and once at market closing (the intervals because of the refractory period... or... rest period, should I say). Without even realizing it, I had spent less time on trading charts and more time on \[awesome websites\] to optimize my ""sessions"". It was great. And before I knew it, I held right through to NIO day where, and now NIO stands at $57.

Holding can be beneficial. And there are multiple examples of such other than NIO and TSLA. And many other individuals in this subreddit can testify to that (DFV, SIR JACKALOT). Whether or not they utilized the same strategy as me, I'm not sure. Regardless, this outlines the importance of holding and what I did to hold. It might help some of you guys struggling to cope with the psychological pressure to sell.

I thought it was necessary to post this because of all the fear, uncertainty, doubt circulating in the market. And I thought that my strategy might help you hold the **stocks that you like.** Regardless, I hope all of you get to the moon with some crispy as heck tendies.",2021-01-31 20:04:23

DD about Melvin closing their position 🚀,2037,l99eep,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l99eep/dd_about_melvin_closing_their_position/,583,1612115924.0,"TLDR: Looks like Melvin did close their position, but it wouldn’t affect the squeeze.


DD:

I dug up Melvin SEC filing and saw that they have 5.4M GME shares put in Sep (an increase from 3.4M shares in June) https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-20-001111/
Most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7M in December, but I doubt they have a much larger position than that.


Melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 01/27. GME’s price on 01/27 is ~$360, so it cost them about $2B to $2.5B to cover. This matches the bail they got from Citadel. Also LB, one of Melvin’s top holdings had a violent dip on 01/27 - this could mean Melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover. Melvin has another SEC Filing due Feb 14 for December, so we will have a better idea about their number.


S3 reports that short interest reduced by 5M shares https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=21 on 01/27. This matches with the shares Melvin covered.


This means there are still 58M shares that are not yet covered. What we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg, the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we 💎🖐 

I don’t think that many of these are new short positions because:
1. Shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment
2. Hedge funds tend to target low risk high ROI stocks. This means easy/cheap to short shares with negative sentimental


Bottom line: hold on tight 💎🖐 because we’re gonna go for quite a ride 🚀 🌕

An idea for us try and correct the narrative that the media has created around WSB. #WSBgivesback,416,l992vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l992vp/an_idea_for_us_try_and_correct_the_narrative_that/,98,1612114472.0,"If you haven’t noticed, the media has been trying to paint us in the harshest light possible while trying to humanize these criminal, fraudulent billionaires and hedge fund bros. It’s absolutely disgusting. I’m willing to bet that we do more for people in need than any of these scumbag market manipulating fucks ever have. So I have an idea. 

We have more than enough people in this sub to be an influence on the outside world. We need to do something that actually highlights the good we do for our communities and people in need. We should all take to Twitter and use some kind of hashtag like #WSBgivesback or something idk. And just talk about how some of us make a good effort to give back some of the profits we make when our trades give us those sweet sweet tendies. I’ve noticed more people giving back with their profits from GME or AMC or whatever mooning stock is popular rn. 

It’s hard for the media to control the narrative when we can very likely create some trend on Twitter for everyone to see. Since it’ll be trending, it’s likely some of these media companies write pieces about it (because it’s a low hanging fruit story, ez clicks for them) and we start to actually change the narrative and have it resemble a bit more truth than what the people have been given so far. 

Idk it’s just an idea, I love this community and seeing people give back some of their gains just makes me love it even more. Sure we all joke around, call each other retarded or gay bears amongst other things. But i think a majority of people here are good who want to make a positive change for those around them.

Citadel bought GME?!?!,0,l98q6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l98q6y/citadel_bought_gme/,206,1612112869.0,"So as everyone knows, the Hedge Fund with the biggest short position on GME is Melvin Capital.  As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. 

On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.

Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?

TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don’t want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.

The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,55371,l97ykd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/,8027,1612109430.0,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.

Hello degenerates,

I'm retarded and just looking for second opinions but...

Doing a quick TA on the GME chart from the past week and using a squeeze momentum indicator plus the basic RSI, I'd conclude:

1. Black crosses on the SQZMOM mean it's compressed. Looking at a previous cycle of compression, it was just when the price took off. I bought 64@43.91 so basically when it started.
2. The current compression is quite a big one, lasting a few days. The previous compression timeline looked at a pretty long sideways trend but the difference now is the spikes. It can't go sideways too long. But, if it's so compressed it means there is a pretty fucking huge possibility of having another run like we had from the 40 to the 480 range on the graph.
3. RSI seems to support this too. We are below the normal trendline of the past week. Last time it happened to move up, it was during the 40 to 480 spike. RSI seems to be moving up.
4. Volumes have been LOW as FUCK for obvious reasons (FUCK RH and the blatant manipulation). Hope you retards managed to get into good platforms so you can start buying.
5. The pattern usually warns of a big downward or upward movement of the stock. Based on the RSI and SQZMOM, it looks to be even stronger evidence of a huge spike.

I'm 110% sure there are much better, more knowledgeable people out here. I don't think I'm good or bad. I'd love to hear second opinions here and if what I say is complete shit I will delete the post so people won't be misinformed. Or I'll try to update it if it is possible.

Also, sorry if the flair is incorrect or something.  Post may be too short for DD.

&#x200B;

TLDR;

Hope you bought the last dip because next stop is the fucking moon.

If you didn't buy yet, there's nothing wrong with hopping on while we ride parabolically. You think 10-20% gains on a single day is bad? Fuck no.

What about 100%+?

WHAT ABOUT 1000%?

Don't miss out and don't paper hand like most did during this run. Are you that dumb to miss out on a historic moment? Can't you make money OFF ONE OF THE BIGGEST RUNS IN A SINGLE STOCK?

I've been trading Silver futures August. Don't fall for their shit by listening to your doomer uncle finally,353,l97c0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97c0u/ive_been_trading_silver_futures_august_dont_fall/,202,1612106722.0,"Background: I've been trading silver futures since August which makes me essentially the expert. I joke but not really.

SILVER: the world's fakest precious commodity. As we are poor people here most of us grew up with the perception that silver has value due to its scarcity. No longer is this the case. Base usage statistics state that about 70% of it is used in the industrial manufacturing sector.

Countries hold many tons of reserves. Just Google silver reserves and understand Peru is sitting on a many year stockpile if all of the aggregate demand suddenly decided to only buy from Peru.  As price rises poor countries will inevitably sell off reserves and there is a strong suspicion has been occurring as silver is up big time this year and tax revenues for all nations are down.

So the ETF SLV is a complete crock of shit. End of week I figure out the max pain option price and just sell a call/put based on it as SLV is determined by the futures price, which is heavily controlled through a large amount of paper contracts on both sides of buy/sell that'll never materialize.  If you go through my post history you'll see me shorting silver this summer and while very profitable, I did blow a bunch per wsb lifestyle, but my day to day futures trading gave me tremendous feel for the pulse of it. End of week is beyond manipulated and while I do not have the software to do so; if you threw it in on your computer to short/long slv/silver futures towards its equivalent SLV max pain price (with the caveat of factoring in only the most recent 30 days max pain which is tough to generate except through watching OI/volumes fluctuate) you'd join in on the JPMorgan train as they're the ones doing it. I'd actually argue instead of taking a buy and hold approach to just do exactly that by end of day Thursday as JPMorgan acts like a crooked circus game operator with ""wild"" Friday swings towards max pain or lack of expected shifts (that then materialize monday) so every person who plays their game for them is one less cent they can't make. My theory is with the etf they've sort of become a traditional bank with their reserve (silver) being turned into a cash generating enterprise via the selling of premium. I estimated they were raking about 10 mil of premium a week and while certainly not earning it all via some expiring itm vs their non covered positions, the amount they do is a healthy and lucrative business when there is no major risk to the underlying when you rig the game and have all of the cards.

Futures are better as you are greater leveraged and can buy after hours. GME after 5pm (edt) Friday moved generally like silver does from 6pm-8pm which I find highly interesting given this now attempt to get us to take our eyes off the target and to rely on many years old articles that are now materially false if you were to Google out this theory.

Long term prognosis is as always - whatever the man says to do in the retail arena, means they want you to hold their bags so at a minimum please disregard.

Tl;Dr hold/buy gme and walk away from the computer, do not buy silver of any variety except to jump in on the manipulation as it trades very predictably particular towards Friday when SLV options expire and triple so when the monthly variety are what's expiring, mods are /",2021-01-31 17:25:22

 **This is not financial advice, just an attempt to explain the real story of what happened before the pile-on started**


There’s a huge misleading narrative that WSB “picked” GME because of its short interest and that’s the only reason the short squeeze is on.

Here’s the thing...

WSB hated on the GME DDs! The pile on happened after the initial squeeze began...

#This was always going to happen

Let’s start at the beginning.

GME was shorted at 171% at 2.50. To use DFV’s words: “that’s a seriously ballsy bet!”

GME was never going bankrupt in 2021. Here’s why:

##1) Console cycle 

Historically, GME stock price jumps significantly when new consoles come out. This can be observed easily.

The shorts were aware of this, but bet that it wouldn’t happen again because new consoles wouldn’t have optical discs.

*They were wrong...*

There’s plenty of support for this thesis by real analytics investors. I give you Micheal Burry - of Big Short fame. He went in at &lt;5 because of the above console cycle.

He later said GME was a value play at 20-60, a short play at 80. The reason it isn’t a short play now is because of later events.

##2)  Financial Heath

This one is simple. Mid COVID, with terrible stock prices, GME bought back 7-800 million of debt.

This is simply not something a company going bankrupt does. If they were going bankrupt they’d focus their efforts on survival and bank on discharging the debt in bankruptcy court if it hit that level.

For the record, this fact is what got me into the play thanks to Uberkikz. Buying back debt is not the action of a company dying in the next 12 months.

##3) Ryan Cohen and digital gold

For those of you who don’t understand the times we live in, user data is literal gold when used properly. Ryan Cohen knows this. 

Let’s talk about who he is: 

He wanted to found an e-commerce pet food franchise based on customer loyalty. He was laughed out of investment meetings based on the market being dominated by giants with established market and low prices.

He said that even in the age of dirt cheap virtual flea markets there was a gap to be filled via customer-centric e-commerce. He was correct. He built Chewy up and only sold it because his grandfather got sick.

RC wrote a letter to GME saying they could accelerate their shift and utilize the unique data they have on three generations of gamers to capture a market that is growing by leaps and bounds daily.

When I was looking for recovery plays, i eyed up
AMC (lol), but didn’t bite. DFV and Uberkikz convinced me and I bought in.

Then Ryan Cohen upped his stake...
Then he hired an activist lawyer specializing in takeovers....
Then they PUT HIM ON THE FUCKING BOARD

Now he has 3 seats and two friendly votes.

Here’s the thing, yes Reddit piled on but that’s because at this point they were sold. The thing they’d been ignoring as dumb now had proof.

GME was becoming a tech company and tech companies are forward valued thanks to our bubble, look at Tesla!

This wasn’t a planned attack!! 

## As soon as RC joined the board, the shorts should have covered

They made a bad bet! When Dr Wilson in the 90s realized his short of the casinos went bad, he sent a telegram saying “cover all shares”

Instead, they dug in and endangered everything with their over-leveraged bet ( not gonna get into share loaning and over-shorting but best believe there’s something fucked there).

Reddit piled on because the bull case was clear and the shorts were in the wrong.

There’s nothing wrong with investing on an opinion.

My opinion is that they’ve helped GMEs turnaround by making this news and it’s a foregone conclusion.

Thanks for attending my TED talk. Stop the fuck
the billionaires narrative, **this is a story about shorts making a bad bet against an unlikely value play.... period**

Edit2: i realized I got lost in explaining the value play and forgot the point. I’m trying to point out that before the pile-on there was a valid bull thesis.

Once Ryan Cohen was put on the board, the internet flocked to this and everything went crazy, but I am seeing people on the news saying that “we all got in to fuck the billionaires” and that is just patently untrue.

I got in because at 2.50-10, GME was worth more. Now it’s being squeezed so I have no idea where this lands.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: as requested, my positions:

300 shares originally, got fucked down to 200 by attempting to day trade them right as my broker restricted buys. 50 shares at 14, 250 at 200

options at 14c, 16c, 30c all bought at GME price 14-15, pre earnings from hell: I sold these because I’m sorry I’ve been in since October and this was more money then I’ve ever had.

I hold my shares until the end!",2021-01-31 17:12:53

It is a long process involving paperwork but  In order to skyrocket the price of actual silver you have too force the comex too buy more silver and slv isn't going too take delivery on anything as long as the naked shorts are In controll and the dollar is more powerfull.

☄☄☄☄☄☄☄
This action if done on a large enough scale will throw such a wrench In the works that you might not even care if you had ton of gold because you will be much more concerned about the bomb sirens and gunfire you hear too worry much about it. Either that or we will see a seamless transfer to the new global fiat, block chain based digital currency, which won't last long either. ☄☄☄☄☄☄☄

 I, until the recent developments with Gme   was waiting for silver to drop much lower ($17 level) before buying physical; I am still waiting for a sharp drop, but have become much more tentative In my thesis due too the implications of what's going on. I do believe that they were able to gather enough ductape and spitwads on thursday too keep fiat In tact for now.

TLDR: The only way to blow up the silver market is to take delivery on  futures contracts and force the comex too buy large amounts of silver on the open market.

Edit: I know we're all pretty broke so suggesting emptying out the comex is quite a stretch but with the amount of money I've seen some of you making I'm sure you could afford a $100 face bag of 90% just too get the ball rolling. For the record I'm not buying at these prices but like I said I'm tentative, and either way one day $27  will seem like an absolute steal.

Even though I've been 'responsible' in that even if i lose everything I've put into GME / BB so far goes to shit I will be ok, it's still pretty stressful.

Fucking Robinhood restricting GME last week really makes me paranoid as fuck that they will just shut down the whole app at the moment of reckoning, and everyone will just miss the whole boat when GME truly moons.  And when they turn it back on we'll be the ones left holding the bag.  


But, my recommendation is to think about yourself when you're an old man/woman. In 50 years when i look back on this time, I know I would regret selling too early way more than selling too late.  So for that reason I know i'm holding all the way to zero if i have to.

Ally Invest Locked my Account from trading! INCOMING DIRTY TRICKS,334,l964fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l964fl/ally_invest_locked_my_account_from_trading/,153,1612101849.0,"Warning to all and looking for some help.

First, I have yet to receive my GME shares from my ITM GME JAN 29 Calls. I called earlier today and  the representative said that they could see the shares from Apex, but that Ally was experiencing a system problem in getting them to my account. They also said that they couldn't guarantee that my GME shares would be available on Monday.

Now, I went to Ally this evening to set a sell limit for my other GME shares to $69,420, but I received an error message that said my account was disabled from trading. I am sitting on the phone waiting for a representative now.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

Also, this could be their next tactic, ""system issues"" that prevent us from trading. Be on the look out.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Sat on hold for an hour, no answer. I will call back in the morning and update here.

Edit 2: Just got off the phone with Ally (recorded the call). They first said that my account was down because of a system update that they were pushing through today. Then I told him that my wife's account was working fine, and he went silent. He then went to check on something and said that it was because of the GME call options. Because the shares were still not assigned my account had been frozen so that I ""didn't over draw the account"". I told him that was bogus because I have plenty of capital and margin to cover the purchase of the call. He went silent. He said that the shares from the call would be available later today and that the update should be complete by noon. I told him that if they can't get my account up so that I can trade in what will likely be an incredibly volatile day, they are looking at a lawsuit. He said ""yup"" ---This is what I think their next tactic will be. I will check my account later today to see if anything has change.

"Your broker restricted trading, and the short’s broker may too when $GME squeezes",763,l962su,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l962su/your_broker_restricted_trading_and_the_shorts/,192,1612101697.0,"First, you really should [read this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

No, really, go read it. 

But if you don’t have time, here’s the important bit: 
The DTCC is practically the insurance of the entire stock market. They set a fee for every trade as collateral (for buyers) and return it when the funds clear. Trade funds take 2 days to clear.

All trades go through clearing houses. They facilitate trades from brokers (*like your favorite trading app*)

Let’s say the upfront fee is 1% for a certain stock. When a $1mil buy order through clearing house A happens, clearing-house A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of $1million to fund clearing-house B (sellers) Once the wire of $1mil from A-B clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back to clearing house A. 

If it doesn’t clear because Clearing house A doesn’t have enough funds, the DTCC is stuck footing the bill to the sellers at Clearing house B. 

If the DTCC runs out of cash and goes down, the market goes down with it 

Now, due to the extreme volatility of meme stocks and their potential to skyrocket through the moon and beyond, the DTCC set the collateral fee to 100%, as if the price goes too high *even* the DTCC may not be able to foot the bill. This collateral-hike meant brokers such as “the trading app that shall not be named” had to send the DTCC an unprecedented **100%** of the value of buy orders **AND** begin a money wire of the buy order to the sellers of the stock. So, in total, that’s a *cool* **200%** of every $GME buy transaction made. And so, put simply, some clearing houses did not have the sufficient funds to fulfill buy orders of $GME

**But** **what** **if** **this** **happens** **to** **the** **brokers** **of** **Melvin** **and** **other** **short** **sellers?**

When the price of $GME goes high enough, the short-sellers’ broker *may* (idk I just learned how to read, *this is not financial advice*) not be able to cover the **100%** collateral per trade. This **could** see a rather slow squeeze as shorts can only cover a small amount per day. 

This may cause the price go up incrementally day after day, but only if we **hold**

What do we do then? **WE HOLD** 💎✋💎✋

We **HOLD UNTIL THEY DO THEIR COVERING**

$10,000 is **not a meme**

I’m not a financial professional. Please correct me if I’ve gotten anything wrong.

It wasn't and this is some dangerous misinformation as it needlessly makes /u/DFV a target. DFV is simply an eagle-eyed investor who bought into his GME positions quite a while ago, even before anyone here cared about GameStop's fundamentals or the remote possibility of a squeeze. He isn't some mischievous troll who decided sometime in early January to rally all of us into a stock-buying frenzy in order to stick it to some villainous wall street firm, nor did he ever make any special effort to promote GME in order to incite a squeeze. A large number of users here had known of the outsized short interest for a while so this entire thing was the organic result of increasing GME discussion.

Potential Endgame Scenario: GameStop issues SOME shares and negotiates the best price on our behalf.,54,l95pvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l95pvf/potential_endgame_scenario_gamestop_issues_some/,194,1612100368.0,"So this started with me being worried that GameStop would issue shares to Melvin at a price of their choosing and walk away with billions, leaving us holding the bag (or at least prevent the short squeeze). But that's just the thing: While they DO want to use this opportunity to better capitalize, they DON'T want to piss us off after what is currently happening to Robinhood. IPO? Nope. Solvency? We'll see. So how does Gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly?

Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional ""20%"". And you may say ""Why negotiate a price?"" Because GameStop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders (many of us included). So they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500/share ($30 billion to the books), while allowing all of us to realize those same gains.

""But what about the squeeze?"". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.

Thoughts? Holes? Additions?

Position: 16 shares GME, diamond handed.

Edit: I'm being told my example of ""20%"" is way too high for what Gamestop is actually able to issue. If anyone is able to explain why they couldn't get more authorized, or what the maximum value they COULD issue is, I'll update.

💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 My bad, typed it on desktop.

Edit 2: General responses have been, outside of me being a 🌈🐻 corporate shill, that GameStop can only issue $100m worth of shares now, which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more. The other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares, but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more. Would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term.",2021-01-31 15:39:28

I was checking out GME on TDA's ToS platform. When I go under the options section, you have the ability to check out options at all the major dates and can change the data you are able to see. I am able to see '[open interest](https://i.imgur.com/RZB4bil.png)', which if I'm not mistaken are all of the options open everywhere, aggregated for me to see aren't they? So can I not add up all of these open interests for strikes and get the total contract amount for puts and figure out how many shares are left on the short side and when they would be needed?

Also I know you are able to rollback shorts but how expensive is it to roll them back and for how long? 1/29 had more open interest contracts than any other date so it's likely the date that they're most likely to roll them back on if they think they're going to be able to shake GME holders. Do these open interest contracts then appear next week on 2/5 expiry date?

1. Are retail investors at a point where they are shorting themselves? This answer I know is No. I've never seen such comradery in my life. My own family would have sold at $6 after making a $1 profit even if it was for the greater good.

What will it cost them to try and stay alive and hope for the price to go down when the squeeze is not happening? The interest must be sky high to hold these shorts.

Is it even possible for them to hold longer then a few weeks?

Why all this matters - my GME story and how the system used me,347,l9afjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9afjk/why_all_this_matters_my_gme_story_and_how_the/,201,1612120674.0," 

This is my story of how companies like Robinhood take advantage of the fact that individually we are weak.

I am a small time investor and member of the WSB community and I like to support even though my pockets aren't that deep. Since I am from the EU I use Etoro because we don't have Robinhood.

On 29/12/20 I bought a small amount of shares (4.7) in $GME with plans on holding for as long as I could.

My portfolio is really small but I do have one leveraged position at x2 for just a couple hundred with no money in my bankroll since all my money is in open trades.

On 08/01/21 the day of a big dip in my leveraged position I receive an email from Etoro giving me only a couple hours notice before they close my position at a loss which I didn't want to take:

""Due to extreme market volatility in the markets, margin positions for all leveraged positions is increasing to 100 percent. This applies to both CFD and real leveraged positions.

If you do not increase the margin to 100 percent then the position will be closed at 21:00 GMT today (Friday January 8, 2021). The invested amounts in these positions, together with any profit or loss incurred, will be returned to your account balance.""

Basically, I had been in profit along with many others and they decided this dip was their chance to cut some losses and force out the small guys, taking profits for themselves.

Sadly I didn't have enough to cover in my bank account so I had to sell off my entire portfolio in order to stop them from closing my leveraged trade, selling out stocks I owned like $GME at a loss in order to prevent an even bigger one.

They tell us what we can and cant do with our own money, they tell us we can play the game but really they make up the rules as they go so they always win.

It makes me proud that so many of you were able to hold out against the illegal practices of companies like Robinhood and Etoro.

I liked the stock, but they forced me to sell.

The “120%” short float we keep seeing thrown around without any sources comes out to ~80 million shares short, and the volume the past week is more than enough to have exited their initial short positions and reenter at ATHs in the $400s

Why $AMC over $BBBY?,123,l9a9yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9a9yg/why_amc_over_bbby/,577,1612119971.0,"First of all let me pay my respects to the king $GME. Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  


$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC  


tl;dr $GME $2000 $BBBY $250 $AMC dilution (no tendies)",2021-01-31 21:06:11

Diamond hands not enough. GME Price Surge -> Gamma Squeeze -> MOASS,887,l9chbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9chbg/diamond_hands_not_enough_gme_price_surge_gamma/,328,1612129233.0,"Good morning fellow degens,

GME has already changed my life more than I could have imagined and I know that's true for many of you. But I'm not selling yet!

I want to see this thing through so I'm diamond handing my remaining 1000 shares. However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.

Let's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.

**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**


*All shorts are new shorts*

* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.
* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.
* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. 
* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. 
* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.

*Gamma squeeze sqouze*

* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.
* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. 
* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.
* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).

*Whales are big for a reason*

* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?
* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.
* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.
* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.
* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).

**What If? Worst possible future for retail**

Here's how this could play out poorly for retail:

* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.
* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.
* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.
* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.
* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.
* Game over. :(


**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**

* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.
* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. 
* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. 
* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.
* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.
* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?


I want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this [same case with charts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8w7z3/currently_banned_from_posting_in_wsb_but_this_is/)!


**Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week**

* It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements
* We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze
* Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible. 
* Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.

**tl;dr** 

**HODLing may NOT be enough to trigger the MOASS. Buy gme, buy gme, buy gme!**

This not investment advice. And I'm not suggesting anyone make any actual moves or listen to me in anyway. Look at my past plays. Most of them are terrible. I somehow lost money on the Vegas play over the summer and I've lost money on TSLA more times than I like to think about. I bought BABA right before the ANT IPO didn't happen - then doubled down (that may work out yet though). Anyways - this is all for entertainment purposes!

"A note to hedge funds, financial authorities and the media in anticipation of next week",2774,l9bwat,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9bwat/a_note_to_hedge_funds_financial_authorities_and/,306,1612126986.0,"Hello fellow apes,

**Disclaimer; I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice or an encouragement to others to take certain positions. I am fully retarded and had crayons for dinner last night. Also, I wear a helmet all day long and I can’t even cycle.**

In anticipation of next week, I need get something off my chest regarding the financial authorities, brokers and the media. We all know how Wallstreet has ruined the economy over and over again with the 2008 crisis being the most recent one. What was Wallstreet doing when the economy collapsed and thousands lost their home and ended up in debt? That’s right; celebrating with their buddies because they made billions. They were literally laughing at the little man from their balconies while sipping champagne. What consequences did they face? That’s right; none.

Now a bunch of retards on an internet forum found out about Wallstreet making two mistakes of monumental proportions;*- Shorting more than 100% of a stock- Grossly underestimating how stupid retail investors really are*Now, as a consequence $GME surged to unprecedented levels and it seems the finishline has not yet been reached. Consequently, a few hedge fund managers are starting to get nervous because the red numbers are running up. Luckily for them, they have billions and friends in high places that would not mind a share of those billions. The result? Brokers shutting down retail investors, whereas hedge funds could short  and buy the stock freely. Some brokers actually may have had problems with clearing houses, but all of you know which brokers did what.  The ultimate goal of this short ladder was to trick people into selling. Unsurprisingly, they did not. The aftermath of this showed that hedge funds and brokers are holding hands and probably clenching their buttholes too.

It also showed that the media is beyond willing to stick their neck out to protect the big boys. The media have been portraying the hedge funds as the ones that REALLY know what they are doing, unlike those bubblehead retail investors. Simultaneously, we were described as ‘’an alt-right platform’’. What?! We are a literal bunch of individual retards who just happen to like the same stock from time to time.

Financial authorities are calling market manipulation by retail investors. They are saying that hedge funds deserve the time to ‘’recalibrate’’ their positions.They are saying they needed to halt trading to ‘’save the financial system’’. Well, let me tell you this; If the survival of the financial system is so strongly related to the survival of a hedge fund IT IS YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS WRONG.I don’t know man, but last time I placed a shitty trade I did not have the opportunity to call my billionaire buddies to ask them to halt the market so I can ‘’recalibrate’’ my positions. If you make a dumb financial decision, you take the L and that’s that. The rules should not be changed after the game began and more importantly; the rules should be the same for everyone.

For years people have wondered how those people on Wallstreet make so much money. They have been shouting the answer from the rooftops for a long time; ‘’BE GREEDY’’.Wallstreet deemed itself absolutely unbeatable but the retail investors listened and they are hungry.The arrogance and blatant market manipulation backfired and exploded right in their faces and to be honest; they deserve it.

I’ve seen dozens of articles about this not being the real value but in the end a stock is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it AND WE LIKE THIS STOCK. And let’s not forget guys; Since when do hedge funds give a damn about fundamentals? Thanks to Wallstreet we have seen unimaginable surges and crashes throughout the years. But now they are suddenly crying over fundamentals and about how they just want to make a living? Get of out of here, please.Due to the market manipulation last week it became obvious that this is not even about fundamentals; the free market is free until the poor start taking from the rich. Extreme surges are apparently only market manipulation if hedge funds are not in on it. Politicians, celebrities,  and working class people alike expressed their indignation about what happened. Hedge funds crossed a line here and the anger towards them is not misplaced. This no longer is about fundamentals (okay it kind of is because the short squeeze thesis is legit), but this is now also about morality. Hey Wallstreet and financial authorities; By trying to manipulate the market and squeeze some measly dollars out of retail investors you have turned yourselves into the biggest antagonists on the planet.

So to any financial authorities or hedgie spies reading this; I am holding my $GME. If it goes to 0, it goes to 0 but I am not selling.

To all my fellow retards and everyone around the globe following this; May the odds ever be in your favor and may your trip to the moon be pleasant. Godspeed retards

GME - Bullish Pennant - This will go much higher before it goes lower! - UPDATE,385,l9blz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9blz2/gme_bullish_pennant_this_will_go_much_higher/,197,1612125857.0,"GME is in a classic Bullish Pennant pattern now.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The bullish pennant is one of the basic patterns traders learn to recognize when they start trading.

Looking at all the technical indicators of this chart GME should be ready to move higher by roughly the same length as the previous rally before the consolidation happened (the triangle shape is the consolidation).

If the plot that on the chart we end up at $933 for the next peak, so yeah $1000 is probably really not a meme, its fucking possible for sure.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Of course it only happens if enough people buy the stock on monday, but with 7.3 mil degenerates on WSB and the entire world hearing about GME for a straight week in the news, smart and dumb money will flow into this stock on monday.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Meanwhile the SPx, SPY, QQQ, are all looking super bearish, and ready to do a steep correction, so probably GME is one of the only safe stocks out there to invest in right now. The rest is all a short!!!! This has been brewing for a couple of months, and many respectable hedge funds indicated end of december they expected a -10% correction on the broader markets in Q1 2021. That means tech, and finance, and everything will go down (which has been already happening last week).

This is not financial advice or any kind of advice, this is just one autistic degenerate talking to himself. I WOULD NO NOT BUY THIS STOCK, it's highly volatile. It might cost you all your investment.

That being said, it did buy this stock again on friday and I have been feeling sick all weekend. If you can handle the stomach churning and dizzying swings you probably are just as autistic as I am, and this is a great stock for such retarded degenerates who want to prove their manhood in other ways than banging their girlfriends sister.

EDIT:

1. To those thinking I predict 933 as the top with this post, no that is not what I am saying, I just think that's a possible next rally, and 933 could be where the next consolidation happens, but maybe this could go much higher. Also you all peer pressured me into holding till I die, so I guess I will never make bank on this one.
2. To those saying TA does not apply here, I believe TA always applies anywhere, but TA is only 20% of trading analysis, the rest is fundamentals....oh wait you are saying fundamentals went out the window in 2020? ..... so yeah, this is just 20% of analysis the rest is I DUNNO WHATEVER, WELL SEE, still better than the casino's.
3. I got many questions where to find charts like this, it can be found on tradingview dot com website where many traders share charts and ideas.

"""The Clearing House Ate My Homework""",305,l9b8av,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9b8av/the_clearing_house_ate_my_homework/,86,1612124232.0,"Just to be clear, the whole ""the clearing firm can't handle the liquidity!"" is bullshit. We've heard rumors that RH interns have heard of calls from Citadel to put a stop the sales. Last Thursday it seems pretty obvious to me that Citadel needed a price crash on Thursday for them to be properly hedged for Friday in order to prevent a gamma squeeze.  

#Evidence  

1. The original, official statement from RH was that the stock was too volatile and that we needed to ""be protected from ourselves."" Even if they wanted to just give a basic & vague explanation, ""the market is facing internal liquidity issues outside of our control"" would have sufficed.  
2. The CEO of the Chinese company WeBullShit decided to give an actual explanation where he said it was due to the clearing house. Except that doesn't explain AT ALL why trades were only halted in one direction. Why can I sell a share on RH but not buy it? If it's true that their clearing house couldn't handle the traffic without massive collateral, it makes no sense that trades aren't blocked **bi-directionally*.  
3. TradeZero's CEO said he just argued with the clearing house and they backed down LOL. How is that possible if their official stance is ""Sorry bro this can cost me billions of dollars in risk"" ???  
4. [RH's CEO explicitly said that they internally made the decision and it was not at the behest of any other market participants.](https://twitter.com/vladtenev/status/1354900963232890883)  

> To be clear, **this decision was not made on the direction of** any market maker we route to or **other market participants**.  

#Explanation  

I'm not saying that the clearing house had nothing to do with it, but it's obvious that they're struggling to get their stories straight. Why wouldn't they have straight stories from the get-go? Why has RH's explanation changed twice now? Why is the clearing house able to support GME trades for some and not others?  

Citadel was about to get gamma squeezed again last week to a nuclear moment of naked short margin calls, liquidity problems, possibly clearing house issues, and end-game market crashing. Cramer's gone from ""Woo! Fanboy for WSB to play both sides!"" to ""Okay you guys won... pack it up... please???"" Those who are in-the-know know that this thing is about to crack the fuck open. There have been several ominous tweets we've seen here already regarding Citadel doing shady shit and the market being on the verge.  

TL;DR: Citadel is at the heart of all of this and calls in favors to make it happen. RH changes their story three times. I don't want to see any fucking ""I feel bad for RH for being misunderstood"" shit -- they are feeding you bullshit and you are eating it like a sundae.",2021-01-31 22:17:12

**Anatomy Of A Short Attack**

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

-----------------------------------

**Typical tactics include the following:**


**Flooding the offer side of the board**

Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. **They will do what has been called a short down ladder.** It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

**By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.** If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

-----------------------------------

**Media Assault**

**The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.**

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

-----------------------------------

**Pulling margin from long customers**

**The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.**

-----------------------------------

**Paid bashers**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

-----------------------------------

**Analyst Reports**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

-----------------------------------

**Planting moles in target companies**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

-----------------------------------

**Frivolous SEC investigations**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

-----------------------------------

**Class Action lawsuits**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

-----------------------------------

**Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.**

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

""What's important when you're in that  hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the  truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view,  to create a fiction.""

""Then you  call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in  Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to  give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today,  and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""

""A  lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a  stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could  drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""
