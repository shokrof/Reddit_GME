$PTSH is a 🚀 preparing for launch. Best protected downside and highest upside stonk available now.,10,len1vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/len1vi/ptsh_is_a_preparing_for_launch_best_protected/,20,1612735510.0,"I’m jacked to the tits in $PSTH based on DDs of others on WSB and some special needs people on Twitter.

And by jacked I mean converted my old 401k from Oracle into a brokerage link on fidelity and bought 209K (@27.50) in $PSTH shares and 38K in $IPOE. I also bought 50k in shares (@26.23) in my trading account and 18k worth of 12/17/20 c40 at $6.

My fidelity accounts have 894K total now and 301K (up a little from when I got in) is in $PSTH positions.

Too many times I see posts of people posting about a stock after the thing already mooned... annoying.

When the company is announced this thing will rocket and I’m holding because if it’s stripe it’s going to be a $500B market cap company in 2-3 years. (I know what brothers said on Twitter 3 months ago, but in the world of tech that’s an eternity).

Newbies looking at GME,22,lemzne,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemzne/newbies_looking_at_gme/,6,1612735294.0,"Greetings fellow tards/autists/apes,

There’s a good chance of this getting downvoted to oblivion but I thought I would try to help new entrants to the GME saga. I’ll try to keep it nice and short. 

After participating in the tard-lympics I have noticed a few trends and I think they are likely to repeat on Monday. The SSR restriction has been lifted after a green day and I believe the shorts will be extremely aggressive lowering the price.  Everyone knows that the updated SI gets released Tuesday and they are going to try to kill any momentum. 

I don’t know if we can even trust the number on Tuesday because we all know they have tricks galore up their sleeves (and it’s an old number etc etc) but if it comes back high, they know everyone will be reinvigorated. They want the share price to be as low as possible if that were to happen. 

I have 100 shares and have nothing to gain from this other than hopefully helping others position themselves in a better spot than I’m in. 

If I were to enter a new position after experiencing the ups and downs I would enter Monday afternoon and possibly even AH. I have no clue what will actually happen tomorrow but I expect us to open lower and then to slowly fall throughout the day. If you feel that we will have takeoff on Monday morning, go for it. But the last thing needed is paper hands joining and selling right away. If I’m wrong and GameStop somehow gets to $200+, I’ll get diamond hands or can’t stop wont stop tattooed on myself as punishment. No way am I doing that for less than 20k though. 

This is not financial advice, just random thoughts by a retard. Plus any financial advisor would tell you to stay the hell away from GameStop in the short term. 

Anyway, back to searching for AOC feet pics.

$EVAX - Evaxion Biotech full DD,1,lep28p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lep28p/evax_evaxion_biotech_full_dd/,1,1612742196.0,"tl;dr: not this time. I see many people asking how/where to find new multi-bagger stocks, well I think this might be it. Below is reasoning why I believe this might be the case. There is plenty of time to board the ship as IPO was just few days ago (5th of Feb). Also, this won’t give you any quick gains to write home about. It’s more like casino where you can make an informed bet – and here is the info I could find. It should go without saying, but **I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice!** Just opinion and invite for discussion.

(**Sources in comments**)

I’ve posted a shorter version of my DD last Friday. Will use some of the same sources, so this one could be stand-alone DD.

[Source 1](https://s26.q4cdn.com/889291935/files/doc_presentations/Evaxion_Corporate_Roadshow_January_2021_for-website.pdf) \- The main source I’ll use is presentation published by Evaxion Biotech. I recommend to go through it to get a picture on how big are things there are working on. It does much better job, than what you will ready below.

**Premise**: We as society are collecting more and more data about everything and that includes *DNA* data. Our AI data analytics technology is getting more robust every day. Combine loads of *DNA* data with AI capabilities and we might get the following:

· Highly personalized treatment. We all know that each one of us is slightly different and those differences are coded in our genetics. For example, most vaccines are safe for like 99.9% of people and are beneficial for whole community as it stops spread of disease by heard immunity. In my opinion it would be completely ethical to let that 0.1% slide if based of their *DNA* composition it’s clear that vaccine might have side effects. It wouldn’t impact success of vaccinations, but would reduce unfortunate events that fuel some of the conspiracies.

· Better understanding of allergies and food reaction. We all react differently to the same food and this depends mostly on our gut biome (sometimes that gang can be very picky!). By analyzing humongous amounts of data AI systems could predict specific reactions to treatments and suggest the best options.

· Aging. Some scientists say that aging is a disease as any other and it might be cured. If this is true, then how we age is, again, coded in our genetics. Amount of data stored there is probably not really comprehendible for most of us, but using a bunch of cleverly written algorithms it does become a ‘crackable’ task, thus there should be a lot of room for advancements.

· Machine learning advances. Most of the algorithms are available publicly at hat helps to advance entire field forward. AI driven medical solutions are getting more and more traction, which attracts big money and that in return spirals even more advances in the field as it becomes profitable and self-propelling thing.

If you want to read more about how AI and big data works together to provide remarkable analytic abilities, antigen and phenotype detection, predicting prognosis and treatment outcomes – check **Source 2**.

Obviously, there are many huge companies working on AI driven immunotherapy solutions (Intel, Microsoft, NEC, most large medical companies aka ‘big pharma’). Evaxion Biotech probably is not going to outcompete them, but they target specific areas of expertise and already have 8 issued patents with 46 pending applications. I wanted to have a closer look and here it is.

**Company**: Evaxion Biotech A/S, a clinical-stage artificial intelligence-immunology platform company, identifies and develops novel immunotherapies for the treatment of various cancers, bacterial diseases, and viral infections. The company develops therapies using PIONEER, an immuno-oncology platform; EDEN, a bacterial disease platform; and RAVENTM, a viral disease platform.

Here is what those platforms are actually used for (**Source 3**):

**PIONEER** platform for the identification of patient-specific neoepitopes to potentially transform the immuno-oncology treatment landscape. **Advantages**: Identification of Therapeutic Neoepitopes, Speed, Identification of Therapeutic Patient-Specific Neoepitopes, Identification of Multiple Neoepitopes, Strong Clinical Applicability, Potential for Repeat Use Over Lifetime of Patient’s Cancer Treatment, Favorable Safety Profile, Continuous Improvement.

**EDEN** platform for the identification of broadly protective antigens for use against bacterial diseases. **Advantages**: Highly Efficient and Reduced Attrition, Identification of Novel and Unbiased Targets, Data Driven Precision, Ability to Provide Broad Protection, Optimizes Antigen Design, Speed, Scalability.

**RAVEN** platform for the rapid response to future pandemic viral diseases. **Advantages**: Promiscuous T-cell Epitopes, Multiple Hits on Target, Coverage of Entire Viral Cycle, Mutation Proof, Neutralizing Focused, Broadly Applicable.

**People**: Copenhagen where Evaxion Biotech is based has high concentration huge medical companies. It’s sometimes called a ‘Medicon Valley’ **(source 4**). All of which meaning that concentration of expertise is there and that reflects on composition of company (**source 1**):

https://preview.redd.it/ges5hnh6v2g61.jpg?width=912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76c71fc981bd54a43286bff68af31ed5b72ed810

Also check out who is on their board of directors and advisors panel. There’s even a guy who’s a member of the Nobel Award Panel.

**Research**: Development of pipeline candidates including lead programs EVX01, EVX-02 and EVX-B1, enhancement of proprietary platform technologies. What are all these codes about you can find in Source 1. I told you, this one is good.

**Upcoming Catalysts**: FY2020 results (4/26/21); Q12021 results (5/13/21); shareholders meeting (5/25/21); EVX-01 Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial readout anticipated in first half of 2021 **(Source 1**); EVX-02 Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial preliminary data readout expected first half of 2021 (**Source 1**); EVX-03 Initiation of toxicology studies and submission of regulatory filing H2 2021 (this is for Skin and soft tissue infections  vaccine – it doesn’t exist at the moment).

This is sneak peak on preliminary data from EVX-01 clinical trial (more in **Source 1** and fist dose info – **Source 5**):

https://preview.redd.it/q4xlxcl8v2g61.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a82c71894bcc79b36bc7bd25d36373b62520273

**Industry Catalysts**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare Market Size Worth $61.59 Billion By 2027 | CAGR of 43.6% (**Source 7**). People like charts, so there’s couple of them (**Source 10**):

https://preview.redd.it/dygifwk9v2g61.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f12a02868e932aeea8e019f4266e2efb8607e4f

https://preview.redd.it/k79tpjrav2g61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b26ebeeaef381942a9630a388947beeaf8fa8dbe

I don’t know about you, but for me it looks like ‘dolla, dolla, bill ya'll’. In general healthcare industry is robust to various economic impacts – we all get sick, we all age, doesn’t matter if economy is up or down.

**Summary**: it’s important to understand that all clinical trials face the same risks, just because they go through the same process and we can assign some probabilities here using data about success rate of those trials. This is how all phases of research looks (**Source 6**, more data on success rate of therapeutic areas – **source 8**):

Phase 1: Several months, approximately 70% of drugs move to the next phase;

Phase 2: Several months to 2 years, approximately 33% of drugs move to the next phase;

Phase 3: 1 to 4 years, approximately 25-30% of drugs move to the next phase. **This where approval of FDA or their equivalent takes place.**

Phase 4: Phase IV clinical trials happen after the FDA has approved medication. This phase involves thousands of participants and can last for many years.

Now all above is for a standard clinical research. Evaxion Biotech comes into play with AI driven clinical research and that helps a lot to streamline whole process. Read more on AI impact on clinical trials in **Source 9**.

As mentioned in tl;dr, given all the info above I believe $EVAX could explode once results of current clinical research starts rolling out. This might be that chance to get in something at the very beginning and enjoy the results in couple of years. Place your bets responsibly!

My position: 50 @ 9.65 (contemplating going deeper on Monday and looking for some affirmation or challenge in comments)

We’re still the ones who own stock and the hedgies are still the ones shorting it and will have to buy it from us. Look at the recent DD’s here and elsewhere. They’ve now shorted an estimated 177% of the stock. Even if that’s way off and it’s only 90%, that’s still far too much. They’ve exposed themselves too much.

My question/s is/are: how much buzz was there for GME 5+ months ago? Was DFV posting about it or generating interest here? How did his word get out? Generally, with such good advice, I am wondering how he got people to listen, and also, I am wondering if people, in fact, listened.

2. Study more about Finance so in future we are not retards (as much as now). I am doing it now. There are a lot of free courses and you can a lot of basics. Now this doesn't mean you should keep searching for GME / AMC - just the basics or advanced if you'd like.



I am doing number 2 as even though I (personal opinion) feel a lot FUD and I made a mistake and what not bla bla; I would prefer that in future I don't feel this way and all my ""bets"" are more solid and not as much of a gamble/affected by the extreme manipulation and borderline criminal actions of the ""big guys""


Let me know how you guys are feeling? What are your plans? 
I will probably buy if it dips at around $50. 

From what I see, it seems there might some change tomorrow. But most people are waiting for the data to be released on Tuesday

$GME/$AMC SPY inversion,17,lescan,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lescan/gmeamc_spy_inversion/,15,1612751689.0,"People have been point out the synchronous movements of AMC and GME  for awhile now.  On here, and on Twitter I’ve suggested that it was inverted to the SPY chart which either some people correlated themselves or picked up and ran with my half ass comments. My half assed theory was mainly that MM may be over hedging their position and that the correlation is because AMC/GME have similar beta ratings. If the correlation is true it’s probably because the MM still could have much more money to loose. 

I want to say correlation is not causation and it’s irresponsible not to point out that. However, when a fish stinks the head is missing.  Here an example of how a possible correlation might take place. 

I notice that there seems to be a lot of large sweeps for ATM the money calls for SPY. These sweeps came in chunks but here’s one that’s open. 

390C 3/19 29k O/I premium 23.82 mil  SPY

2.9 million shares of SPY x388.20= 1.12B

They are hedging for 1.12B at 50 delta. And that total grows by the number of ATM spy calls with Expiration between now and then.  

this is just a half ass explanation for retards to run with.",2021-02-08 04:34:49

Remember in the movie the big short. How the banks realized the entire housing market was about to crash. 

But than manipulated the price of the mortgage bonds to go up. Thus leaving anyone with a swap holding their dicks in their hands. 

THEN went and purchased swaps on the bonds they have just sold. I actually speculate that it may be happening with these short squeeze stocks too. because. i feel one thing we can all agree on. was there was mass manipulation going on with these stock prices. and even rn i feel like, if there are still huge shorts open, OR DD shorts as most speculate. why wont the hedge funds go buy a ton on worthless option calls , so when the float comes out and the stock is hyped again. they can axtually be on the profitable side of it... And please dont tell me this is not something they would do. (BTW JUST SPECULATION. NO REAL FACTS TO SUPPORT MY THESIS) 

but remwmwber what BURRY said ""do u mean that you are ready to price my swaps fairly now that you csn make money on them?"" 

im just saying. they wont do all this alleged manipulation and fraud if it is not what we thoygh it was. AND i wasnt an OG on this page. i used to stop by here and there for the last yeAr ti see the insane stocks you degenerates yolo on. but never ever. has a stock got me hyped like GME. 

PS . it would really suck if im wrong on this one. cuz so far the only stock i have purchased as a bust in my life was ACB a little more than a year ago. i purchased hundreds of securities in my life. and i was never wrong. ever. just acb and potentially this.

Here's some spicy bits about what happened on day Robinhood sold out it's customers- Jan. 28 Thursday :

>**Vlad Tenev:** And so Thursday morning, so I’m sleeping. But at three thirty a.m. Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So basically, as a broker, as a clearing broker, and this is where Robinhood Securities comes in, we have to put up money to the NSCC, based on some factors, including things like the volatility of the trading activity, concentration into certain securities. And this is this is the equities business. So it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else.So they gave us a file with the deposit and the the request was around three billion dollars, which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.  
>  
>**Elon Musk:** So why is this kind of like this seems like like it sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula that they use to calculate that?  
>  
>**Vlad Tenev:** Well, yeah, and just to give context, Robinhood, up until that point, has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital.Up until now. So it’s a big number, like three billion dollars. This is a large number. So basically, the and you know, the details are we don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula, but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things, although it’s not it’s not fully transparent. So there are ways to reverse engineer it, but it’s not kind of publicly shared.And then there’s a special component, which is discretionary. So that’s that kind of acts as a multiplier and basically…  
>  
>**Elon Musk:** discretionary discretionary meaning, like it’s just their opinion.  
>  
>**Vlad Tenev:** Yeah, it’s it’s a little bit I mean, I’m sure there’s there’s definitely more more than just their opinion, but basically…  
>  
>**Elon Musk:** I mean, I guess what they’ve gone through, everyone wants to know whatever it was like, did something maybe shady go down here? Like, it just seems weird that you get a sudden ten billion dollar demand, you know, three billion or even more. Sorry, how much?  
>  
>**Vlad Tenev:** Yeah, it was three billion  
>  
>**Elon Musk:** up two to three billion around. You know, just suddenly out of nowhere and what does  
>  
>**Vlad Tenev:** I wouldn’t I wouldn’t I wouldn’t impute shadiness to it or anything like that. And actually, you know, the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. And they’ve been they’ve been they worked with us to actually lower it. So it was unprecedented activity. You know, we don’t I don’t have the full context about, you know, what was what was going on in what’s going on in the in that is key to make these calculations.But, yeah, essentially…  
>  
>**Elon Musk:** if anyone holding you hostage right now…

What Vlad calls ""the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this..."" was the $3B deposit was lowered to $700M by the NSCC after RH suspended buy trading on GME.

Among other things that Vlad doesn't say but must know is this-

Citadel has huge influence on the DTCC/NSCC - a non-governmental industry consortium which put the demand as was well evidenced by this redditor's post:

Bottom line RH's biggest of all customer Citadel was able to play the Telephone Game to get the message loud and clear to Robinhood.

"AMC: Not GME, an insider conundrum, and a ticking time bomb",13,leys3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leys3g/amc_not_gme_an_insider_conundrum_and_a_ticking/,23,1612769960.0," Hi Everyone,

This post got a lot of great feedback in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) so I figured I’d cross-post it here, without the options component and dumbed down a bit for the smooth brains here. For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how ""big finance"" has already dumped on retail investors, and why you should worry about round 2.

**1.** **You’ve already gotten played and are licking some big finance nuts:**

In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already blown their load on you and quietly extracted almost **$1 billion** dollars from retail investors and diluted the stock further. See [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E) and [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week). These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the Hamptons right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every AMC share combined was **$500M** two weeks ago.

**2.** **Most of you are too smooth-brained to understand dilution, so they’re buttering up your butthole for round 2**

A lot of you are saying the share price is barely above pre-COVID, so the downside doesn’t seem that bad if you’re bullish about the future of movies… except you’re missing the real story...

The current MARKET CAP (value of all shares) is actually \~3.5X what it was, because there are now 3X as many shares, and they’re continuing to use an infinite money glitch to dump more shares on you because you haven’t noticed that and keep buying. It's basically a disguised stock split, where you're actually paying \~$21 to get the same ownership that you would have had pre-covid. See [here](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap).

*An analogy:* You sell your house in 2007 for 100k. In 2008, they offer to sell it back to you for the same price in the middle of the housing crisis. You LIKE THE STOCK, so you’re seriously considering it, even though your neighbors at Cinemark are down 40%. But there’s another catch – the house now comes with 3 other roommates (dilution) and a mortgage (more debt) now, and they’re trying to sweep that under the rug and sell it to you for the same price anyways

**3.** **But forget the fundamentals, SHORT SQUEEZE!**

I'm weary of debating short interest %'s - I'll just say this - a squeeze is improbable, but not impossible in the short run. What we can agree on – it’s a worse candidate than GME in pretty much every way with more float, less short interest, less concentration of shorts, and more volume. But the story get worse…

Unlike GME, AMC’s already told you that if the prices stay this way, they’re considering [whether to issue even more shares, dilute you further, and kill the short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive/exclusive-amc-entertainment-explores-new-capital-raise-amid-stock-surge-sources-idUSKBN29Y03C) for good.

**4.** **But wait, there’s more! The insider conundrum…**

What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at several of the other pumped up stocks. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are/were still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:

\- Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution (e.g., buyback, content plays)

\- Wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them so they can blow their load on you too

**5.** **The play:** Both of the above will absolutely dilute you and kill the squeeze. I don’t recommend shorting this stock since I’m not ruling out a squeeze entirely in the short term, but this is NOT a game where you can just HODL forever. It's a ticking time bomb. I am/will be loading up on Put Debit Spreads as IV comes down.

tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where big finance has already blown their load on you, and insiders are edging right now for round 2.

Disclaimer: This is not investment advice and I am not your financial adviser. Also not an endorsement of GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month. This one also doesn't depend on others joining the cause or holding the line.",2021-02-08 09:39:20

Imagine you’re playing a game of chess in a tournament. Your opponent has been in the world of chess a lot longer than you and has a suspicious history of winning. However, in this particular game he over-extended himself in an attempt to ~~make a quick buck~~ defeat you quickly. You noticed what your opponent was doing, and, while sticking the rules of chess, you took advantage of his greed and foolishness. You have now cornered your opponent; all he has remaining are a handful of pawns and his king. You still have the majority of your pieces. Your winning of the match is all but inevitable. It’s your opponent’s turn now, and after he moves one of his pawns, he ~~not so~~ subtly knocks one of your bishops onto the ground. He tries to be sneaky about this, but if you were looking at him, it was pretty apparent what he did. It doesn’t matter; even though you’re down another piece, your opponent is still stuck in his predicament with no way out. You move your knight to a position where it will be mate in 3. It’s your opponent’s turn again. He moves another pawn and then knocks your ~~Robinhood~~ knight off the table. Again, as long as you were paying attention, it was pretty obvious what happened. However, the ~~SEC~~ referee of this match wasn’t paying any attention to your opponent. In fact, the ref NEVER seems to be paying attention to your opponent. He doesn’t think he has to. The ref is sure your opponent is just an all-around good dude who pulled himself up by his bootstraps and would never cheat. The ref, if anyone, would know that since the ref and your opponent actually go waaaay back. I mean, he was best man at his wedding and their daughters play lacrosse together. No action is taken, and the pattern continues, and as each ~~day~~ turn passes, your pieces continue to be illegally removed from the board. Your position (pun intended) is beginning to look dire. Taking a glance at the board, though, this makes no sense. It is nearly impossible for the board to have gotten to this state through a series of LEGAL moves. Going by the rules of chess, this game should have been done (or close to it) by now with you as the undisputed winner. Even though you have chipped away at your opponent’s remaining pawns, you are now at a fraction of the number of pieces that you started with, and most of those missing are mysteriously on the ground. Your opponent looks at you and asks if you want to just ~~sell your stocks~~ surrender the game early. At this rate, he says, you’re bound to lose even more pieces before the game is over. You shake your head; there is still hope. Although your pieces have been decimated through means that the ref has turned a blind eye to, your opponent’s king still has not left his corner. He is still stuck! It is at this moment that hordes of ~~hedge fund shills and fake redditors~~ cOmpLeTeLy RaNdOm bystanders come over to spectate your game. They begin heckling you; they are calling you ~~a bagholder~~ stupid for DARING to think you could beat an opponent with such experience. They are vehemently urging you to quit. And their urges are definitely coming from an “unbiased” place since they are definitely “not” ~~simps~~ friends of your opponent. During all of this chaos, somehow more of your pieces were removed from the board even though ~~the markets closed~~ it wasn’t your opponent’s turn. You look at the current state of the board and contrast it to how it was shortly after your opponent got greedy. Sure, it’s a disaster, but you can STILL WIN. It may be much tougher now, but THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD. The way the game is going it looks like it may end up carrying on for a long time, but you know one thing. You. Won’t. Quit. Whether it be a stalemate or the win you deserve. You won’t give up the game to a cheater.

Fuck cheaters and fuck everyone who hates on GME being a movement.

If you’re here as an investor who is not about this being a movement, THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD.

If you’re here as a compulsive gambling addict who is not about this being a movement, THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD.

Hold the line.

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke the momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. \~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add \~15.8M short positions at an average \~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of \~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of \~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of \~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons.

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase.

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time.

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.**

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from \~69M to \~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price?

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position.

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Hedge funds were not going to have to close short positions within those two days. So Robinhood banned retail traders from buying. why ?",2021-02-08 06:04:40

Short Ladder Mathematics,111,lf7x8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf7x8k/short_ladder_mathematics/,39,1612803666.0,"I've seen several posts refuting the possibility of ""short ladder attacks"" but I think they all make the same fundamental mistake - they assume that an institutional investor does not have the money to create the volume necessary to move the price. I don't buy that, and here's why:

Let's look at the 1-minute interval beginning at 12PM last Friday. During that minute, 170k shares were exchanged, and the price dropped from about $64 to $62. I can't access the historical order book for that time, but in general, order books follow a gaussian distribution about the mark price, with 95% of all orders within +/- 5%. So at exactly 12PM, we could expect the order book to have bids for 60k @ 64.5, 20k @ 65, and 5k @ 66+. Likewise, you'd expect asks for 60k @ 63.5, 20k @ 63, and 5k @ 62-.

In order to naturally drive the price down, an investor would need to have 85k shares in the first place, and sell them all for as little as $62. The argument I've seen against the viability of short ladder attacks is that shorters don't have the shares to begin with, and they couldn't afford to blow $5M every minute all day.

**But there's another way!** Rather than driving the price down naturally, a participant with access to high-frequency trading can *literally wipe the order book* and pick the price it wants for the given interval. Specifically, they *buy* all 75k asks and nearly instantaneously turn around and *sell them for a loss*. This costs them 75k times the average difference in price, in this case about $150k. This is much more sustainable, and can be arbitrarily activated throughout the day. In fact, the cost to manipulate the mark price up or down by $*X* per share during an interval with volume *V* is approximately *X* * *V* / 2. Couple this with some well-timed FUD and momentum psychology, and it seems entirely plausible that a relatively small actor could manipulate the mark price of a stock significantly.",2021-02-08 19:01:06

My concern lies with the potential of firms to inaccurately report their short interest levels to FINRA. From my understanding, it is the short investment **firms** that send these reports to FINRA, and not the company itself \[Gamestop\].

What is the reasoning behind my concern? **It is the penalty/fines for frauding the short interest that is the issue.** In the most simple terms: The amount fined is extremely low.

# How does this relate to GME?

If you haven't been living underneath a rock the past two weeks, you should know about all the market manipulation going on for GME. All the short ladder attacks against GME by hedge funds, all the media manipulation, the brokerages restricting GME orders and plummeting the price, the immense failure-to-deliver orders on GME; There's honestly way too much to list.

Hedge funds are spending millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, every single day for these strategies and to pay off the interest on their expired short interest and failure-to-deliver positions.

Do you really think they wouldn't pay a million-dollar fine in order to save billions on their short position?

# Get your tinfoil hats ready

A lot of people are waiting on the February 09th date to decide what to do with their GME stock positions. We will probably see the wildest price fluctuations on the 9th, whether it soars or plummets. I know, I know, most people here will HOLD GME to the god damn ground. But unfortunately, a lot of people are looking at the February 9th date to understand the situation.

And Hedge funds should know that.

They should be aware that, if the Feb 09th report is accurate, it will show their short-positions. It will rally the stock again, and it will soar to the moon. At that point, there isn't much they can do to manipulate the stock. Everyone will know they lied to the media about covering their positions, and won't believe a thing they say. Everyone will have moved on to a real brokerage by then and can execute trades again.

**So why haven't they covered yet?**

In my eyes, there are three possible reasons why they haven't covered their position yet.

1. They're waiting for the February 09th date. After the short interest report is released (and it inaccurately shows the low short-interest due to fraud) there will be a huge selloff in the next few days. They will probably cover their positions a few days/week after February 09th: as the GME stock will have had plenty of time to react and fall in light of news of the fraud short-interest. At some point, the increasing interest in their expired short-positions and failure to delivers will outweigh the decreasing GME stock, and they will cover. They would also want to sell this before FINRA catches wind of this, and publicly announces that there was fraud regarding GME short interest (I personally think it takes FINRA a while to discover these things, so don't count on it. But GME might be an exception they're eyeing due to all the attention surrounding it)
2. They're going to cover on February 08th, before the news is released. They will use everything they have left at their disposal, all the media attacks, the short ladders, EVERYTHING. They will bring the price as low as they possibly can, and close out their positions towards the end of the market day. If we see huge downwards movement tomorrow despite low volume, this is probably what is happening.
3. They are somehow clueless that the short-interest report on Feb 09th will cause a retaliation of the stock, and increase the volume. The stock will rise immensely within days, and they will be caught with their pants under their ass. The paper hands will again see their opportunity, and join back into the stock as the price keeps rising

# What should you do?

If the short interest report comes out, and you believe, based on your DD and research, that the short-interest levels simply don't match up to what they should be: You should **HOLD.**

**HOLD** through the crash. **HOLD** through the FUD.

The shorts will cover a few days/week after Feb 09th, and there will be a very indicative spike in volume and price. This will also probably be followed with momentary confused hype around the stock for a few days, further increasing the price. Keep an eye out for these days!!!

# TL;DR

There is a possibility the February 09th release of Short-Interest info will be fake, frauded. This is because the fine/penalty for reporting false information is EXTREMELY LOW (anywhere from 100k to 2 million on average in the past). Hedge funds will save BILLIONS by taking that measly 1 million fine. They already are spending millions every day on interest for their expired short and failure-to-deliver positions, short ladders, media manipulation, etc strategies.

Be prepared to HOLD through this. Expect them to cover their positions after a few days/week after the rising interest cost of their expired short position and FTD > the continued decreasing price in GME

At the very least, just read the ""So why haven't they covered"" part of my DD so you know what MIGHT happen in the next few days and what to do.",2021-02-08 16:25:53

DD: Why Gamestop GME is worth $1000 without a squeeze,1789,lf9hby,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf9hby/dd_why_gamestop_gme_is_worth_1000_without_a/,568,1612810780.0,"A little background first.  Gamestop was heavily shorted last year as hedge funds though it was a dying company.  

However in September Ryan Cohen who is the largest individual hold of Apple stock and founder of hugely profitable digital per food company Chewy started buy huge chunks of GME stock and indicating he was going to turn the company from brick and mortar retailer to a profitable online gaming juggernaut.

Also Michael Burry of The Big Short fame sent a letter to the GME board 
https://www.marketfolly.com/2019/08/dr-michael-burry-long-gamestop-sends.html

Once WSB got hold of this we saw the huge inflows of retail traders which pushed the price to $480 before buying was restricted culling the potential short squeeze.

Now Gamestop's price to sales ratio (P/S Ration) is currently less than 1. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/price-sales
(Market Cap $4.4BN /Annual revenue ~$7BN).

This seems fine for a dying brick and mortar but if the company becomes profitable (likely in next earning report in March) and starts to transform into a tech digital platform for gaming (likely as e AWS exec hired as CTO) it's P/S ratio will start rising to match other tech companies.

Square (SQ) for example has a P/S ratio of 14+ https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SQ/square/price-sales.

If GME had a similar P/S ratio (after the above happens) the share price would be well above $1000 per share.

Also remember the market is forward looking so if it seems signs of profitability and transformation then it will head to that valuation well before the process is complete.

* I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice, this is my personal opinion only.

Edit: Thanks for all the awards folks.  Ignore the bots and shills with ""this is retarded"" comments with no counter arguments. Why would they make comments like this, they must be scared.

Edit 2: This is an update for those who have a hard time understanding my post.  I'll dumb it down a bit for you guys with eh limited IQ's.

Tech companies are valued at higher multiples than brick and mortar stores.  The new Gamestop board is looking to transform it into a tech business.  See Tesla vs legacy auto and the difference in multiples there.",2021-02-08 20:59:40
Reminder of what ACTUALLY happened with GME.,31597,lf75c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf75c4/reminder_of_what_actually_happened_with_gme/,2446,1612800131.0,"All you people saying things like 'the squeeze happened, you missed it', 'don't gamble on stocks', 'the bagholders were the greedy ones', 'people with no experience trading shouldn't have bought gme', 'GME was a stupid play from the beginning', 'I was wrong to buy GME', 'I should have sold GME'. Are all talking complete fucking bullshit and are twisting the truth and recollection of what actually happened, in reality, for actual fact. I don't know if they are bots, people who missed out or bitter bag holders but they are just fucking dead wrong about what the GME play was attempting and came within a few hours of accomplishing. 

GME went from $40 to a peak of $483 within a WEEK. The biggest shorter got bailed out for $2.75BN because of how bad their position was. WSB was getting national fucking coverage. This sub went from 2 million to 8 million subscribers. There were 60 million shares shorted going into thursday and at its all time high, would have cost a staggering 29BN dollars to buy back less whatever they were shorted at and that is not even counting the price going up by doing so. 

So no the squeeze didn't fucking happen, no you weren't wrong for buying in at 200 or 300 or even 400. The play worked and it got within hours of paying out. 

I know this because the brokers got margin called by the clearing houses for fuck sake. Now RH and other brokers might say it was liquidity issues but I can tell you for a fact that all those shorters got their shares from somewhere and if you think a few million people buying shares with CASH deposits in any way compares to the ALMOST CERTAIN losses that the brokers were facing due to likely defaults by shorters was the reason they turned off buying, you are dead fucking wrong. 

The brokers got margin called any way you look at it and they should have margin called the shorters. But they didn't. They pussied out and did something criminal. They affected one side of a trade and not the other, that is an unprecedented manipulation if ever I have seen one. But I ain't suprised by it and neither should anyone else and that is not the point of this post anyway.

Stop saying it didn't work, it was never going to work, we got greedy, we got stupid and all the other hind sight self delusions to make yourself feel better. The play worked because it went by the rules these people had set and you can't blame yourself or anyone else or redicule people for getting involved, when those rules get changed at the last second. The GME play was solid and made history, never forget that you fucking pussies.

Edit: I sold at 420.69 the other week and put it all back in on friday just gone, make of that whatever you want

Edit2: https://ibb.co/T4XTWqt
https://ibb.co/H7G4852
yeah i took some profit, i never said i was the hero of this story..

Edit3: Can't keep up with comments. Either you believe brokers restricted buying because of increased collateral requirements due to USERS buying in CASH. Or you believe that maybe, the tens of billions of increased buyback costs on shares they had lent out where somehow setting off the clearing houses tolerance alarms.. your choice.

And I have not and will not advise anyone to do anything regarding the future of GME, make your own fuckin mind up. thank you for all the pretty icons",2021-02-08 18:02:11

How 75% of GME Shares Are Still Shorted. S3 is Wrong.,8528,leyrrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyrrr/how_75_of_gme_shares_are_still_shorted_s3_is_wrong/,586,1612769930.0,"  

\*First off, this is my opinion based on the facts available. This is by no means financial advice. I am not a financial advisor\*

If you are not familiar with EDGAR, it is the SEC’s database for various types of company filings. One of those filings is called the 13G. 

\*“The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements.”\*

When a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock, and holds more then 5% of shares available, they are required to AMEND the filing 13G, making it the 13G/A. When these documents are submitted, they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in EDGAR. 

In the case of GameStop’s “short squeeze”, and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was the only institutional holder, owning over 5% of shares, that liquidated their position SO FAR. BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021.

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001364742&entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&startdt=2016-01-26&enddt=2021-01-27&page=5](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001364742&entityName=BlackRock%2520Inc.%2520(BLK)%2520(CIK%25200001364742)&startdt=2016-01-26&enddt=2021-01-27&page=5)

\^control-f: GameStop

BlackRock is the SECOND largest institutional holder of GME, behind FMR LLC with 9,534,090 shares, according to Yahoo Finance. So… you are probably wondering, “How many shares of GME do The Top 10 Institutions hold combined ?”

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)

Let’s Count:

\*FMR LLC\*   9,534,090

\*BlackRock Inc\*    - 9,217,335 (According to 13G/A)

\*Vanguard Group Inc.\* 5,288,507

\*Susquehanna International Group LLP\* 4,444,128

\*Dimensional Fund Advisors LP\*  3,948,114

\*Senvest Management LLC\*  3,225,740

\*State Street Corporation\* 2,609,487

\*Morgan Stanley\* 1,995,842

\*Paradice Investment Management LLC\* 1,832,526

\*Norges Bank Investment Management\* 1,811,792

Total: 25,472,891 Shares of GME or 25.473/46.89 = **54% of Float Shares**

&#x200B;

On the same Yahoo Finance page where we found ‘Top Institutional Holder’ data, if you scroll down, you can see ‘Top Mutual Fund Holders’. Combined, these funds hold 18.75/46.89 = **40%** of float shares.

\*Note that two of these mutual funds own over 5% of shares, meaning they would need to file with the SEC if they were to sell. These two mutual funds hold **22%** of float shares. \*

Accounting for BlackRock’s liquidation, **54**% of shares are held by the Top 10 Institutional Holders at the moment. Lets say, worst case scenario, only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares, making that **22%** of float shares. So far, we have accounted for **76%** of all shares. 

The last data we have on short interest is \~**122%** of float shares. The media has reported numbers as low as **33%** short interest post squeeze**,** according to S3 partners. Mathematically, this is impossible. 

If short interest is truly **33%,** that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13G/A…. But they didn’t…..meaning they did not sell. This means that there is still, **at a minimum, 76% of float shares shorted.**  This is VERY high and could cause another squeeze.

**TL:DR**

As you know, lots of bagholders around the world are not selling. It just so happens that we are not alone. We have some of the BIGGEST institutions bagholding with us; **minimum** **76% of float shares in fact**. If you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there, you are sorrily mistaken. These institutions (i.e. Fidelity, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley) want to see this second squeeze just as much as you. Until then, HOLD THE LINE!!!

Edit: I made a mistake. The 13G/A that BlackRock Inc filed on 1/26/2021 was a statement of ownership form, declaring that their position of GME was 9,217,335 shares. There was no liquidation of shares.

Edit: An institutional owner that owns more then 5% of float shares needs to file a 13D/A within 10 days if their ownership changes by 1% or more. This is important when searching for updated data on what institutions exchanged shares.",2021-02-08 09:38:50

Short answer: it do go up

Long answer: Many reasons. Oil futures market is in backwardation. I know it’s a long word, but it just means that there is a short/medium term mispricing in the commodity market. Signaling a possible shortage in supply. 
Also, lockdowns are easing, I don’t have to explain to you what this means. 
Also, majority of shares took a beating after earnings report. It does not take a genius to know that stonks only go up. 

But which stock you say? 

RDS. I like it for the long term for various reasons, but it is one of the few oil stocks that has good news in the short term: it has just increased the dividend and made some cute acquisitions. Also, it’s much leaner after the post covid impairments.

$SLV is Currently Undervalued Whether There is a Squeeze or Not (Physical market price discrepancies),0,lengv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lengv9/slv_is_currently_undervalued_whether_there_is_a/,77,1612736951.0," 

Last week there were a lot of people hating on the posts about silver going up. These people instead pumped stocks like $GME and $AMC (which went down 75%). There are real reasons why silver is going to go up.

First of all, physical silver is becoming more and more difficult to get by the day. Currently an ounce of physical silver will cost you anywhere from $34 - $40. This is $7 - $13 over paper silver prices. It makes you wonder why physical is going up so much when the paper market is still staying flat/going down.

There is manipulation in the silver market by big banks such as JPM and Goldman Sachs. COMEX can just create paper silver contracts out of thin air, which keeps the silver prices down. The COMEX cannot possibly fill all of the open interest on the silver futures contracts. That's why when silver started to go up last week, they raised the margin requirements on the contracts by 18%, forcing larger players to sell when they received margin calls.

With all the money printing going on, and rates being held near zero, its hard to believe that the price of silver is fairly valued. I believe that all this money will eventually find its way into silver, just like it found its way into the stock market.",2021-02-08 00:29:11
The emerging agricultural LED tech market,386,lfb6hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfb6hw/the_emerging_agricultural_led_tech_market/,145,1612817624.0,"Grow light technology is rapidly evolving beyond simply growing plants indoors with the prevalent ""full spectrum"" marketing slogan. There are many specially tuned light type arrays and intervals, which effect everything from livestock behavior/growth speed and the color/taste of produce.

There's a major growth opportunity with this tech, coupled with emerging environmental and sociopolitical climates, such as:

* Climate change is shifting the tropical rain belts in the Eastern hemisphere (Europe/Asia) more northern per the recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00963-x): where there's less sunlight on average, forcing LED adoption to offset crop loss from shorter days, particularly in subarctic regions.
* Climate instability: with flooding, drought, etc. climate patterns becoming harder to predict, both livestock and plant growth need moderately reliable patterning to accurately meet future agricultural output goals and projections.
* There's a growing demand for stable food security and production across Asia, as a matter of national security, especially in the wake of pandemic food supply chain disruptions.

Plants and livestock both benefit from specifically tuned LED color combos, which effect growth speeds, enhanced flavors, etc. and where a few companies are now innovating.

Additionally as user **PhotoMacro1** states:

>PhD in plant science here. Another big source of revenue will be using Red and Blue LED light post harvest. Even in grocery stores.

This snippet from the Everlight Electronics [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlight_Electronics) is pretty good TLDR of the space:

>In 2019, Everlight's newly formed optoelectronic R&D team introduced tunable LEDs to maximize animal husbandry and aquaculture.  
>  
>For instance in poultry farming, exposing a chicken to white light takes 172 days to reach reproductive maturity, while exposing to red light reduces to 168 days, but blue light increases maturity to 182 days. Green light exposure makes poultry gain weight faster, due to growth hormone receptor stimulation and enhancement of satellite glial cells which promote muscle development.  
>  
>The R&D team also introduced UV LEDs for eggshell surface sanitization and water disinfection for waste water runoff. In collaboration with Dr. Kun-Hsien Tsai, Professor at College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, a novel ovitrap was introduced which pulses Ultraviolet C to regularly destroy collected mosquito eggs.  
>  
>In 2020, Everlight collaborated with Professor Wang Yong-song’s team of the Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University to develop a special LED lamp for grouper fish aquaculture, where specific wavelength exposure reduces cannibalization and loss of fingerlings by over 40%.  
>  
>In 2021, Everlight released new horticultural LEDs in spectrums tailored to augment the red pigment of strawberries. Strawberries rely on sunlight to produce their red color through a process called anthocyanin biosynthesis, but in areas with little sunlight horticultural LEDs can be used to catalyze this biochemical process instead.

2. Unity ($U) calls--SAFE TENDIES  EDIT:Still slipping today a bit. Advisable to wait until afternoon or so to enter position 

As you may have noticed, Unity (software developer, about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech) took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it dumped 14% from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that, importantly, had several spikes to $140. There is still positive buying pressure.  
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, guess who bought the dip? CATHIE WOODS. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th. Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity, and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on Friday exemplify the buying strength. It WILL return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives.  

Positions: $U 2/19 $140C, 3/19 $150C.


3. Peloton ($PTON) calls--Trust The Woods  

Peloton was another company that had stellar profits, but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections. Revenue? Increased 128% to $1.06 billion. Subscriptions? Increased by several hundred percent each for their Connected Fitness as well as digital subscriptions. Your wife? Getting heftier each day, and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders. Peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like. Aside, do NOT forget they also are acquiring Precor, giving them a solid footing in the post-Covid gym ecosystem.  
What happened to the stock? Again, like Unity, dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections. It also nicely recovered during the day (I managed to get in at $143, hehe)  
TL;DR? Peloton's bottom line is not affected significantly. Their growth is explosive, and continuing to rise. Cathie Woods again acquired another tasty 106,200 shares for ARKW. What does this mean? If she buys the dip, you need to buy the dip too.  

Suggested options: 2/19 $150C, 3/19 $165C


4. Twitter ($TWTR) puts.  

As in October...and July...and April...and February...and the October before that....Twitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10%. Why did it do this every time? Slowing user growth, as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue (they stopped running election ads) meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time. Now? People are (likely) leaving Twitter in droves. I had some info here about why, but I'm assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after I say the name of the former President, so I'm just going to leave it at that.  
Technical analysis? It's been running up to an ATH. The potential for it to dump right after earnings is INSANELY high--all it needs is a slight blemish on projections. And I'm pretty sure there will be many, many scars on their projections.  
On the flip side, their profits will likely be very good. Thing is, I simply do not see how banning the former President will help their bottom line and growth projections. Let me know what you think about this below.  

Suggested options: heck, why not 2/12 $50P for $93. You could do a longer date and higher strike, but honestly, either it dumps or it doesn't.


5. ArcelorMittal ($MT) Calls--steel gang isn't done yet  

The reasons for purchasing $MT and other steel stocks such as $VALE and $CLF have largely not changed. However, most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $X's brief rocket to $24 before pulling back...and then doing an offering.  
The normal reasons still apply--demand is high, supply is low, new infrastructure projects on the way, etc. This is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence, and giving some momentum back to the stock. Plus, the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low IV, so it doesn't hurt to toss a little money at it. But to be clear, this is a much less assured play than the 3 I have already listed.  

Positions: $MT 2/19 $23C for $66. Could also just YOLO a 2/12 call on Wednesday at market close, should cost around $30 each


There are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well. Disney, GM, Uber/Lyft, Enphase. I might also do some weekly $DIS calls and ride the run-up to earnings, and then sell before earnings as positive Disney Plus news might already be priced in with their Investors' Day fireworks.

In any case, I might post some more DD on other things I find and research. Only slight annoyance is that barely any people see these types of posts amidst the ""har dar GME give me upvotes because I spent 30 seconds making this meme""",2021-02-08 11:29:18

If you’re wondering why I’m writing this post, why do I care? 

it’s because I’m genuinely confused as to why — when I told my friend to buy GME at 30 dollars and showed him hundreds of posts from here, I demonstrated that  the squeeze was inbound, I taught him all the concepts that went into the MOASS theory, the 🚀 🌝 mission was about to commence— he went ahead and waited until GME was at 150, bought a single share, and then bought 200 shares of AMC at its peak and is now holding the bag as he rightfully should. 

AMC had no fundamental reason for a squeeze, it has like a 50% SI as a percentage of float which is still high... but it wasn’t even close to a perfect set up that GME had. 


AMC was actually a dying company unlike (GME which is also dying) but it was like the difference between dying in a cardboard box and dying while cozy warm and strung out in a hospital bed surrounded by your family.

$FB DD Valuation - Actual investing thread,20,lepptd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lepptd/fb_dd_valuation_actual_investing_thread/,25,1612744157.0,"I'm going to aim for a quick write up so forgive my lack of fluidity. As always with investing, I invite counterpoints and criticisms/holes etc. of my pov.

Start with valuation - What should be the forward multiple for a stock like this. Practically every social media names trade at ~50+ forward multiple, each of course with diff verticals/growth rates/opportunities obv.

Mega cap names are trading at ~30 or so. Google is about there, msft and aapl are a tad higher and amzn trades in its own level largely due to bezos and what he's created etc.

The market trades at 22x.

Facebook trades at ~21x.

Of this forward multiple (its expected earnings), one can presume there isn't much contribution from whatsapp due to the egregiously low multiple of 21. (no one is expecting whatsapp to suddenly monetize to the extent it produces ~2,4,10 billion in revenue in the next ~handful of years.) Analyst expect 12.5~ eps in the next year, this gives the ~21x.

Lets break fb into parts - fb/insta/whatsapp (lets just assume oculus/vr doesn't surmount to anything).

whatsapp purchased for ~20b..insta 1. We know more about insta's contribution and with its greater growth and higher monetization (2/3rds of new add growth) we could probably assume it with at least a 30-40 multiple, what...200b market cap (snap is 100 and insta has 4x more users etc. I think 200 is conservative and fair, Id say more but w/e..200). Whatsapp has now over 2 bil users, likely ~2.5. This also would trade at 30-40x at what? 100 billion? Again, I'd say more, much more actually but let's just go with that right now.

This is important now -- fb is 750. They hold 70~ in net cash so the biz collectively is worth 680.

Insta is 200, whatsapp is 100...fb would be left with the remaining (BUT let's not forget there are efficiencies gained so let's say that in totality is worth 30 or w/e). We're left with FB, just facebook worth 350b. Now its a waste of time to discuss fb's reach and its continued growth etc etc because we should all know that already.

HERES THE BIG POINT - Assuming insta is worth 200, whatsapp 100, and as said above, their multiple is 30-40 (which I guarantee you would be the case considering every social media company and most tech names with growth similar to these --------- facebook would be left at a 350b valuation with a what...~10-15 forward multiple.

Now, who the fk would think a company the reach of facebook.com, the #4 downloaded app ahead of snap regularly, with growing users every year and stable users in n/a & eu ..with growing arpu YoY..should trade at 12 forward earnings.

Mark my words, fb will do what apple did, it will do what mu has recently done, it will be re-rated and the st will shortly forget the arguments of why fb traded at 20x while the market and all its peers are trading 50% higher. Break fb up (it wont happen), by all means..these stocks alone or together, are worth way more than 750.

Now as for apple and whatsapp very quickly and maybe I'll comment about it more in detal if people converse about it.

Apple - Unity just reported (with 50% ads, much less targeting ability than fb) apple should impact 6% or so of their revenue. Snap's guidance and commentary didn't seemed concerned. Facebook, as analysts and others have suggested, are likely going to lose 1-5% revenue. This equates just 3-4 months of pause in the stock, if not less, it's not this glorified terror that is going to ruin fb. It's nothing. no one will actually care after it passes lol.

2nd about whatsapp. whatsapp has like 60% or so of india's smartphone uses and in a few months, are going to announce their 'super app' integration with that big retailer I forgot the name, look it up if you care. They are trying to replicate wechat and become an app where people message each other, call each other, purchase food, purchase clothes, buy airplane tickets, show snap stories, etc. And they will also have facebooks data of those .5 bil users as well to help with suggestions/ads etc. TLDR - whatsapp is going to contribute 200-300 billion in market cap to fb in the next 3-4 years thru actual monetization.

The ONLY case you can make for fb trading this low is that you think it will be replaced 10-15 years from now or w/e..In which case, it shouldn't reflect this much in the stock as of right now. ONCE they show notably, real declines in users, stagnation in revenue, etc..we can panic and trade it closer to the market, but that is NOT the case right now. What will happen is - facebook will begin to trade closer to its peers and even more when they see continued growth in their top line - which will come from whatsapp's domination of india and maybe even brazil? Also, in 10-20 years, those weaker countries will start growing more in arpu, which would be HUGE for growing fb's top line. Something I've learned is - snap/tiktok, twitter, reddit, discord, netflix, youtube, insta, fb, can ALL live among each other. Each offers its own utility to each user. The harder would be for tiktok/snap to break into fb's territory rather than the other way around. Fb/insta 'profiles' will be here 20 years from now.

TLDR: I think fb is going to ~double in 3 years and triple in ~5. It should be at least 30% higher than its current price.",2021-02-08 02:29:17

"FUBO massive growth prospects, the importance of addressable market size (TAM) and revenue per customer (CLV)",118,lepp1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lepp1o/fubo_massive_growth_prospects_the_importance_of/,44,1612744090.0,"FUBO TV is a sports focused “cable on the internet” streaming service, replacing your cable package (avg. $100+ per month) for $65 per month. In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.

These numbers mean two things: First, **FUBO has a proven product** with traction and growth. Second, it has **just started to penetrate a massive market**. While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO. **It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.**

There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.

Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.

At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $7.5 million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.

In fact, **at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.** This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).

I am long FUBO with both shares and calls. I am not a financial advisor.

&#x200B;

**Addendum 2/9:**

I have been doing more research, specifically into the bear thesis that FUBO will get killed by incumbents via competition and bad content deals. Well it turns out that short seller fud is bs. FUBO is strongly supported by major industry players, and I am sure the margins/deals will improve with growth. Here are some random tidbits to calm the nerves.

&#x200B;

1. Goldman Sachs 13G just came out showing they bought 4.5 million shares i.e. 6.7% of the common

2. Viacom, Disney, and Comcast each control about 5% of the voting power via preferred shares

3. Edgar Bronfman Jr. is the Chairman of the Board

He is a billionaire that has been Chairman and/or CEO of Warner Music Group, Vivendi Universal, and Seagrams (he is the heir). Presumably he can twist arms if the legacies do anything too unfair.

&#x200B;

4. Reverse merger with Facebank Group in 2020

Facebank Group was founded by John Textor and makes those holograms at music festivals. Tupac at Coachella was Textor's work. What does this weirdness mean? 1) They are probably smart enough to pull off the sports betting tech. 2) They have weird aces up their sleeve. 3) I'm buying more FUBO

I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)*

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

Cathie from ARK investments is [planning her own space exploration etf.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/13/cathie-woods-ark-invest-plans-space-exploration-etf-arkx.html) Cathie has grown an enormous cult following and you can bet there will be plenty of interest. Currently UFO is the only space exploration etf in the market, and has only been around a year. Options just became available last week due to the rising volume. 

Since the announcement we’ve seen spce make a huge run. Spce was an obvious choice but there are many other companies set to be bought up. Cathie likes to have ~50 companies in her etfs. Speculation which companies she decides to add can be tough, so this is why I’m playing UFO. There’s likely to be several gems that can easily 2x or 3x in the coming months if not more. Once we have more details and announcements on ARKX, hype will go way up from where it is now. 

Here’s a few other reasons why UFO is both a value and momentum play:

Satellite, tourism, and telecom are now economically viable thanks to the decreasing launch costs achieved by spaceX. 

Location based ride sharing and food delivery are rapidly growing because of the power of satellite-enabled navigation. 

The formation of the U.S. Space Force.

The option volume is currently low therefore UFO has wide bid ask spreads but I expect this to change in the upcoming months.

I opened my account last Saturday around 6 AM, initiated the transfer and was given a deadline of 2/8. Well it was fully transferred by 2/3 at 5 AM. 

Steps:

1. Buy 1 cheap stock

2. Transfer everything else but the cheap one from step 1. (This is in case they transfer it wrong ...like mentioned [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0j3e/done_fck_rh/gm48ekb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)) If that happens, your account will still remain active because of this cheap stock. 

3. Always keep that cheap stock until you decide when you want to deactivate.

4. You can keep that account open for ease of tax documents in 2021, then deactivate. 

Or


Remove that last share and deactivate your account after RH IPOs.

They will want to show growth (as a public company you have to disclose numbers), hard to show growth when customers are leaving.


 Couple important things:

Check your statements in RH. More than likely you will see that any position you have created is listed under Margin. Call up the other broker, inform them of the situation, make sure it is all under cash account. Do not have margin on in new account and be 100% positive that your shares will not be loaned out. 

Other brokers will take time to approve you for options trading...surprise surprise, real brokers doing real things. 

Each transfer from RH will cost $75...while you are on the phone with the new broker, ask them and they may cover the fee...after all, they are gaining a customer so $75 isn’t going to hurt them.

##Make sure live quotes are enabled.
(they are not by default.)

Both Fidelity and TDA can enable live quotes from the app or on the website.",2021-02-08 01:20:12

AMD DD: A Former Meme Ready To Reignite The Rocket Fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,276,lenjhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lenjhv/amd_dd_a_former_meme_ready_to_reignite_the_rocket/,84,1612737199.0,"
A DD I found previously on WSB from u/drrona but aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

 *My positions are **19 Feb 21 90c** as I expect a leg up next week or the following into the 95$ territory range (expected profit - 150% if it hits 95)

*Buy stonks for a great long term hold as I expect this to probably moon to 130-140 range by EOY to early next year specifically near Q3-Q4 earnings.

Advice for transferring from RH -> Fidelity,108,len1ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/len1ge/advice_for_transferring_from_rh_fidelity/,48,1612735469.0,"So it seems like a lot of people are having issues with transferring away from Robinhood, I was able to successfully get all my assets away with relatively little difficulty, so I'll share my process in hopes of helping others transfer with relative ease.

# Things to expect:

1. **YOUR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT WILL BE DEACTIVATED DURING THE TRANSFER. NO BUYING, SELLING, OR WITHDRAWING MONEY. YOU WILL STILL SEE YOUR ASSETS IN RH UNTIL THE TRANSFER COMPLETES.**
2. ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM ROBINHOOD SHOW UP AS MARGIN ASSETS. Once your assets finish transferring from RH, **call up Fidelity and ask them to convert the margin assets to cash assets.** Why does this happen? Robinhood makes every account a ""limited margin"" account by default since ""Instant deposits"" count as margin, because you are technically loaning RH's money to buy shares while your bank deposit clears. It doesn't matter if the cash is settled or not, it's the account type. RH wants to be able to use the shares you buy as collateral if a deposit doesn't go through.
3. NOT ALL ASSETS WILL TRANSFER AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR TRANSFER MAY SEEM COMPLETE BUT IF EVERYTHING IS NOT THERE IT IS NOT FINISHED. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST $75 IN YOUR FIDELITY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE TRANSFER COMPLETES. I got a little annoyed on this, Robinhood debits the brokerage account you transfer to for the $75 transfer fee, not debiting it from any settled cash you have with Robinhood first. This resulted in my Fidelity account getting charged the $75 transfer fee (and me getting margin called technically), and the \~$200 of settled cash with RH was stuck for a couple of days before finally getting transferred over. My transfer showed as complete on 2/3 (with assets and $75 fee) but the settled cash didn't transfer until 2/5.

# How to make it easier/less of a headache:

1. Make sure every transaction has settled/will settle before your ACATS request is acknowledged by RH. In personal experience, they acknowledge it within 2 business days, but assume it will happen immediately to be safe.
2. Sell any fractional shares. These don't get transferred and will be sold off anyways as part of the transfer. Idk if c\*\*\*\*\* gets sold or held since they are a different account technically, but regardless I'd not use RH for c\*\*\*\*\* anymore. (Can't fuckin say the word cuz automod)
3. Make sure NO MARGIN BALANCE (Instant Deposits or RH Gold) is being used. If they are, that will likely complicate things. This ties into #1 of making sure assets have settled, this includes deposits. If you are using any of your Instant deposit balance wait for the cash to settle first, otherwise you might get hit with some ridiculous margin debit when assets transfer. If you have a position that is using margin, probably best to talk to Fidelity before transferring to make sure you know what else is needed.

# Finally: DON'T ""TRANSFER"" BY SELLING ALL ASSETS ON RH AND BUYING BACK ON FIDELITY. YOU WILL PAY TAXES FOR THIS.

Good luck and FUCK ROBINHOOD.

Bumble (BMBL) shares to go live 11th Feb - could be worth a punt,880,len1ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/len1ad/bumble_bmbl_shares_to_go_live_11th_feb_could_be/,340,1612735454.0,"Hey all,

I'm thinking of punting on Bumble (which will trade with the ticker BMBL) when the shares go live on 11th Feb. I'm writing this DD live as I'm fact finding, but here's my take on it.

**Personal experience:**

I've never needed to use a dating app personally, but I have numerous friends who absolutely live by Bumble and I've seen that it works long term (plenty of fun dates, followed by matching up and eventually marriage). My female friends who have used it love the fact that it is woman led and initiated, meaning they don't get inundated with belligerent sex pests like on other platforms, and the guys I know who use it like it because it means that there is less pressure to ooze sex appeal (that they arguably don't have) and be more honest in their profiles. It seems like a far cry from the clear market contender Tinder. As a product, if I were ever in the ""available"" in *that* market again, I'd probably consider using Bumble myself.

**Previous valuations:**

* Between 2016-2018 they were approached with multiple offerings of $500M - $1B \[1\]. Their revenue in this period ranged from $10m in 2016 to $190m. This means they were effectively trading at premium multipliers of between 50 (early on) and 5 (in 2018).
* In 2019 they were bought by Blackstone by $3B \[1\]. Their earnings for this year were $240m, meaning they effectively traded at a revenue premium multiplier of 12.
* We don't have 2020 numbers, but in 2018 there were 35 million users and this year there are 100 million users. I would imagine that their earnings have taken a hit this year with COVID (i.e. lockdowns preventing hookups) but this just means it might be a great opportunity to buy in now.

**Some other considerations:**

* It has been reported that dating app usage actually went up during lockdowns \[2\] which does seem to defy logic. So potentially this might mean a nice surprise at the first public earnings announcement.
* 5 million use it in the US \[3\] - which is some way behind Tinder despite having a very similar market offering. This means that there is growth potential in the user base in the US, and presumably elsewhere in the world too.
* As a long term hold, this has potential: most of the users of the app are aged less than 35 and this is a replenishing stock of potential customers from below.

It looks like trading will start at around $30 a share and a market capitalisation of between $6-8B. To put this in perspective, Match (who own Tinder) are currently valued at $41B - and they made $2.4B in revenue in 2020. This means Match current trades on a revenue multiplier of 17.

Assuming that Bumble can scale 2018 earnings with users, 2020 might see revenues of around $600M. If this is the case and they can attract a similar multiplier, this puts the potential market capitalisation at something like $10.2B. This means that the price could, in relatively short term after first reported earning period, increase to between $38-50. Of course beyond this there is still plenty of scope for increasing the size of their user base, and with it additional revenue in the future.

None of this is advice, and because this hasn't been previously listed it isn't so clear to see the long term valuation of the company and could easily be wrong and it tanks immediately. But I will be buying when the bell goes on the 11th because I think it is worth a punt.

This is 4.5% of the assets under management ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance\_Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies))

If investors are pulling out of one of the most successful hedge funds of all time, which had annualized returns of 60% for decades, what are they doing with their funds at other funds? Where are they going to put their money? 

Is this a sign that money is being moved out equities entirely by institutional and other investors? Or was Renaissance uniquely impacted by the Coronavirus crash, which they say caused their worst ever year in 2020? 

Renaissance is perhaps the most celebrated hedge fund of all time and its annualized returns are practically unbelievable. It's hard not to interpret a nearly 5% loss in AUM as a bad sign for equities.

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. 

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. 

_______

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  

------

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

GME SI DD - Short Interest Clarification,104,leqglz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leqglz/gme_si_dd_short_interest_clarification/,56,1612746332.0,"I've been following the Short Squeeze Season since mid December and I'm interested in everything that has happened. I was trying to find up to date Short Interest values for all of the recent 'reddit/wsb/meme stocks', as CNBC and others like to call them.

I just wanted to share what I have found and I hope the information is valid. I'm not looking to persuade anyone any one way. I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Did I miss anything? I'm an ape. Moon. Rocket. Diamond Hands.

So I came across the FINRA 2021 Short Interest Reporting Dates, found here: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

""FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. All short interest positions must be reported by 6 p.m. Eastern Time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA."" On January 27th, trading became restricted by a few brokers for GME and other stocks. On January 28th, RH restricted trades for the entire trading session, and many days after. However, on January 29th, firms had to report their short positions. This information will become public on Tuesday, Feb 9th. I'm not sure what time this will happen. Also, I'm not sure what the position will show from the January 29 reports. Were the positions recorded at different times from different firms? Were they recorded at closing hours? 6pm as well? Hard to tell.

Regardless, what I see as important here, is that at some point Tuesday Feb. 9th, we will have an updated Short Interest value. Until then, I wouldn't trust any sites values. i.e Finviz, which has shown the same 121% short float % for the past 2 weeks? Because I assume they too are awaiting the reports from FINRA. Does Bloomberg Terminal have access to this information somehow? After all, this data was reported on Feb. 2nd. So the information is out there somewhere.

I started a free-trial on: [https://www.ortex.com/](https://www.ortex.com/) and from a report on there, I found the short interest values that were reported on Dec. 31, 2020 and Jan. 15, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/xz08amp573g61.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=38fd7c8c3fca875c14f7a2586b3462342feafd06

I have no idea what the short position will hold for Jan. 29th. I also have no idea how to interpret the Days to cover column. If anyone can provide anymore information I will update this post.

**tl/dr:** Short Interest Values should be updated on Tuesday, February 9th. Not sure what time. We'll know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then, if it hasn't happened before then.

It looks like there were a reported 21,409,004 shares still shorted on Jan. 29th. Not sure what time that was taken, most likely end of day, or 6p.m. EST. This report is from ortex.com

**Q4 ER**

They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. 

From the ER press release:

"" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents.""

They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!

**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**

Again, from the horse's mouth:

""Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**.""

So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.

**Who are their customers**

Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

**Catalysts**

Do you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.

**Value**

 HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.

Yeah, there's still room.

**Positions**

5,000 shares

100 03/19 $7 calls

**TLDR:**

HIMAX has given great guidance for 2021. Stock is undervalued already. This company will continue its rocket powered flight. Zack's shows room up to $33.66.",2021-02-08 02:59:58

Discovery holds a bunch of networks women love to watch, like HG TV, Food Network, house flipping and all that. Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.

Among all free apps in Apple universe, it has been moving between 50th and 100th place for the past couple weeks in downloads, and have been on top 10 rankings for android for a while. 

Trading at a 20 P/E and 7x FCF compared to its competitors you could say its relatively cheap. 

Now here are the catalysts, Michael Bury owns 500k shares of this beauty. I'm sure he did more DD than me, so betting on big fella to find value for me. 
It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount.
Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.

As you all are aware, growth expectation is everything in this market. Down is up, up is up, everything makes money.

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you to buy the stonk, I just like the stonk myself. Couldnt care less what y'all decide to do. 

As of the day of this post I’m long 1/2022 $60 and $70 calls, also $47.5 3/19/2021 calls and planning to hold until mid year at least.

AMC GOOD LONG TERM? (Buy/Hold),130,leu4y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leu4y8/amc_good_long_term_buyhold/,117,1612756733.0,"Edit: I am aware of the possible squeeze incoming and am already in possession of 7 amc @3.43 I just really UNIRONICALLY like the stock

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think ""wow this is a rip"", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means ""popular"" or ""accessible"".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a ""make-it-or-break-it"" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

The sub is divided and you're creating a cult.,2960,lettza,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/,714,1612755875.0,"Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.

I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like ""short squeeze,"" ""counterfeit shares,"" learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming ""MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN."" COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying ""you're an idiot."" or ""you should have sold like I did retard"" you're only making the problem worse.

If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.

"Market inefficiencies, MOASS and you. A discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us.",118,letq27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letq27/market_inefficiencies_moass_and_you_a_discussion/,55,1612755581.0,"So the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market. A basket of WAY over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market, Rh fucked 80% of the sub, and now there is going to be Congressional and regulatory inquiries. So instead of yet another gme go brrrr post, I would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is. 

There is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this. What that looks like we don't know yet. But because the PDT rule exists I am pretty sure of that. Ironically the rule that is ""meant to protect"" retail definitely cost me more money when I was starting, by trying to avoid strikes, then any crazy yolo's. 

That brings us to the first point to consider. Retail options trading. I am willing to bet large sums of money they're going to come after it. And while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading, do we really have the effect that they will claim we have? Sure it can swing smaller stocks, but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys. Remember how  short lived that was on MSFT? Mass amounts of capital that we couldn't possibly bring to market are needed for that. Softbank did it though, and that was a big dick move, especially because they are Asian and not known for packing schmeat. 

The next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market. HF leverage. They were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history.

[Seriously, this is how bad it was](https://preview.redd.it/34s2v7k2v3g61.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=950655debb8e699323d73684a0137961bf8e3152)

&#x200B;

It might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk. But the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits. This being wsb, I respect that. But it was not retail that over-levered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close. 

The market did not actually crash this time though, and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now.

[Baby dip but decent potential for upside.](https://preview.redd.it/rw516tcjw3g61.jpg?width=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a41cd6f24cf76a7fa5d7c3ccd8005ae8dc9c9a25)

Maybe, just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the HF's and IB's are using? These types of events are happening more often than in the past. The bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this. Maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years ( dot com, 2008, Volmageddon, covid crash, and now this).

&#x200B;

MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD,290,letekr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letekr/makes_wsb_great_again_with_some_wkhs_dd/,170,1612754666.0,"Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝

Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

Edit 4 - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)

Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract).

The specific part of the discussion I’ll highlight is *whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood*. Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD: 

*the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC* 

Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the “177% float” we’re not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts—a no-brainer, if you will. The success of the $GME squeeze scared the funds into avoiding a part 2 at all costs, $AMC surpassing ~$30 and staying there would be in direct contrast to so. many. short. positions. Now, I’m sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn’t even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline—when theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I’m inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.

Tell me if I’m wrong through, tell me I’m missing something. Tell me that $6.00 isn’t a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a... *thrilling*... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I’ll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.

On the other hand though... is it $AMC’s time to shine? Why? 💎 🙌",2021-02-08 05:10:53

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards? From 660 to 460s is a FKING huge jump at those levels. Now let's compare with their main ""competitor"" Zillow [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section_traffic) See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

Rocket Companies (RKT) DD - An Undervalued Gem,256,les23v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/les23v/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_an_undervalued_gem/,168,1612750899.0,"Disclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I’m not a professional, I’m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy’s.

**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.

**Summary**

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
* The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.

**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share. 

This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial/mortgage sector*. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups. 

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it. 

**Key Point - Catalysts**

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

**The Business**

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

*Home Financing*

* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop. 
* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world. 
* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
* Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.

*Home Sale and Search*

* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.

*Auto & Personal Financing*

* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.

*Media*

* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.

*Services & Technology Development*

* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
* Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.

**Recent Acquisitions**

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

**Management**

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

**Financials and Growth**

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth. 

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected. 

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion. 

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

[https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)

**I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

**Product Channels**

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)

The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

**Current Market and outlook**

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Exessive Trading Volumes In Meme Stocks?,13,lerpq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lerpq1/exessive_trading_volumes_in_meme_stocks/,14,1612749962.0,"In the following CNBC article ([here the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-tapping-credit-lines-proactive-to-help-lift-gamestop-trading-limits.html)) RH CEO Vlad Tenev stated:  “With a lot of concentrated activity in some of these stocks,\[...\]”.

In the same article the journalist writes "" Robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading"".

In the attached image I computed a comparison between NIO (which according some brokers was one of the most traded stocks recently) and GME volumes among the period that goes from the 02/Jan/20 to the 05/Feb/21.

It is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for GME are not even remotley close to the spikes in NIO. On the period I considered the maximun daily volume for GME, which occures on the 22/Jan/21, is just the 45% of the NIO's maximum daily volume of 577,185,100.

Also, considerind the maximum 3-day rolling sum of volumes GME is just the 41% of the NIO's above 1 bln exchanged shares.

Computing percentage variations as LN(volumes\_d/volumes\_d-1) GME shows the maximum peak on 314% but above NIO of only 43% and not even in the hottest days of January 2021, but  around October 2021.

Is it true that RH had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in GME?

Feel free to consider my quick analysis as tons of bullshits, but I will hold my tiny-dick position of

$USAC is a good short and long term play,0,lern28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lern28/usac_is_a_good_short_and_long_term_play/,17,1612749761.0,"USAC is facilitates the transport and processing of natural gas and crude oil production. With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.

At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of 14.05% per annum.

From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.

I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.

[http://www.usacompression.com/](http://www.usacompression.com/)

TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable 14.05% yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.

That was the moment that Robin Hood restricted buying.  So even though Fidelity didn’t restrict trading, the RH incident shut down my part of the market too because suddenly demand plummeted.

Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week,420,leram1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/,582,1612748787.0,"There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof. 






Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

I'm relatively new to trading (after years of boomer ETFing).  So, I'm hoping that folks can shine some light on my blind spots.

TAK is handling local Japan production and commmercialization of the NVAX covid vaccine.  NVAX has skyrocketed recently.  TAK is down \~10% in the same time frame.

TAK is also collaborating with Moderna for its covid vaccine roll-out in Japan.  MRNA is way up over the past month.  Again, $TAK is flat/down.

TAK's Feb. 4 earnings report looks solid (to this newb).

On Fri., Feb. 12, TAK will be presenting  Phase 3 data for TAK-620 after already revealing solid top-line findings for the study.

$VSTO DD- A great value play (Vista Outdoors),131,levgwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/levgwx/vsto_dd_a_great_value_play_vista_outdoors/,86,1612760542.0,"**TLDR: Ammo sales/backorders are currently the highest they have ever been, and the market has not reacted yet**

Let me start by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. However, I am a “gun guy” and regularly shoot a lot (~20,000 rounds a year) and compete in shooting sports (USPSA, 3 gun, Steel Challenge, etc). I hold 100 shares of VSTO as well as 10x Feb 19 $35c and 2x Jun 19 $35c. I plan to buy more shares on any dips below $30, and I will explain why.


Some background:
In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington’s ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won’t return to “normal” (i.e. you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).


The fundamentals:
First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):

Price to sales: 0.86x (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that’s insane in a cyclical industry)
Price to book: 2.43x
Price to cash flow: 4.64x
And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is 33.59x. This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).


Looking forward:
Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of 13.5x!!
For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx.. 0.60 cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)


Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this.
Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo


Risks:
Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand

Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)

These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can’t figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)",2021-02-08 07:02:22

Looking at its pass 3 earnings it normally starts to run about 3 weeks before earnings, which would be about now. 

It likes to stay around $370-390 then shoots to $420~ around earnings. Super Bowl weekend is gonna cause a spike in sales too. 

Buying calls for the run up is the play here. Their price normally peaks the week before earnings so 2/19 expiry is probably better since it’s cheaper will offer higher returns.

Why is this of note? 

Chinese capital firm Keybanc reported last month that Tencent is raising large amounts of money for a purchase, with Zynga being among the possible targets.

Blackrock and Tencent are already working together on ways for Tencent to gain more market share in China.

https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/blackrock-in-talks-with-internet-giant-tencent-over-china-tie-up-20191003

So, why does the 5% matter? 

If you own a single share in a stock, you can have voting rights when it comes to major decisions the company makes. The more shares you have, the more your vote counts. If you own more than 5%, you get special voting rights and a 5% or more share-ownership signifies that the owner intends to be an active participant in the stock, rather than a passive one.

In addition, dark pools have been active on Zynga for months now with large purchases coming in almost daily. For those who don't know about dark pools, this is a quick primer:
 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp?

I'm thinking Blackrock wants to make sure it gets a say in any decision regarding Zynga and they've been doing it as quietly as possible.

Zynga stock also just happens to have broken above its high of [NINE YEARS.](https://imgur.com/a/6tPWzF1)

Earnings are this Wednesday, Feb 10, after the bell, and it also presents at two conferences on Feb 11th and March 3. 

Zynga is a sleeper, but it won't be for long.

Is AMC at the current price ($6.83) a good deal?,185,leydor,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leydor/is_amc_at_the_current_price_683_a_good_deal/,193,1612768766.0,"Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

GME FINRA short volume data,60,leyc9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyc9v/gme_finra_short_volume_data/,27,1612768635.0,"We  have a bunch of posts that base some theories off the FINRA short  volume data. This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:

If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice ([https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)) they state that the data:

""(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not—and is not  intended to—equate to short interest position  information. ""

In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)).

For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/))   - \~61.8Mil -  for the week ending 1/15 does not match either the total   short volume reported by FINRA (for all exchanges) - \~84.5Mil- or even   just for NYSE - 24.7Mil.

Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.

For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.

Like  always if I am wrong let me know and I can either take this down or  edit it appropriately. I just want us to be better informed.",2021-02-08 09:17:15

Late on my dedicated time of 1pm EST, but here are the earnings this week with high short interest and days to cover. Just to clarify some of this, in order to make the list, they must meet both of these conditions: they must have a short interest above 5%, and ALSO must have a ""Days to Cover"" (DTC) greater than 3. DTC is calculated by taking the shares short divided by the average 10 day volume. While this isn't necessarily a proper indication, it does show the short amount relative to average trading volume.

Edit: there seems to be some confusion, as expected when dealing with fellow crayon eaters.

Why RITE AID is (RAD) not BAD,54,lexqun,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexqun/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad/,41,1612766923.0,"Hello :-)

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to **TWENTY FOUR** billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

20x 34.5 2/19 c is my immediate play

Edit: my position is 24.5 c I am as they say retarded",2021-02-08 08:48:43
Some AMC “DD” for the average 🦍,159,lexq6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexq6t/some_amc_dd_for_the_average/,38,1612766866.0,"I’ve seen a few people finally bring up AMC as something more than GME’s honorable mention. I’m just a casual trader who was holding 1k of AMC and some option contracts before this clown fiesta of a market trend showed up. I’ve done a fair amount of “DD” on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don’t expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that’s pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.

Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don’t believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it’s much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren’t expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.

This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically: 

Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv.
Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn’t make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios. [Here’s the article ](https://qz.com/1885992/universals-deal-with-amc-is-huge-for-the-movie-industry/)
This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn’t show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.

Next, I should talk about how AMC’s stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock’s value. 
[Here’s another arrival on that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/amp/) 
Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That’s not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023. 

I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC’s future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren’t I’m sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.

TLDR, 
1) Block buster movie budgets are $100’s of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit.
2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix.
3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future. 
   
Still hold GME, AMC, and BB 💎🙌. Since they told me in college diversification is smart, and I’m a high functioning autistic 🦍.

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.

However, with all the vaccinations going on, and Biden winning the presidency, soon Covid will be a thing of the past:

* [$AMC, Regal theaters opening up for customers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/08/20/amc-reopens-movie-theaters-after-months-covid-closures/3403160001/)

* [Indoor dining at ~25% capacity](https://blog.opentable.com/2021/states-provinces-restaurants-reopen-guide-coronavirus/)

What this means is $KO will soon be swimming in money again. If you're quick you can get in before the smart money picks up on these obscure clues.

Now I'm not too good with numbers and stats (who needs it anyway, stonks go up), so instead, to show the potential $KO has let me direct you to the daily graph since 2020:

Before it was TSLA, AMD, weed stocks and we always had extremely bullish retards writing long ass DD to justify their rationale. We also had bearish bears writing theories like quadwitching where we collectively lost money. But even when at peak Tesla, we still had posts about small pee pee AAPL gains, and loss porn because of the Mouse 🐁

I also threw money like y'all in GME and didn't close while ahead. I'm going to diamond hand this because frankly I don't have an exit strategy and with options, I somewhat broke even for stocks i bought. Now we can keep crying about money lost or try to make new money. There are lot of plays going on. What happened to my PLTR gang? Why are y'all so silent? Weed stocks are going up again, yet we ain't paying attention. BYND been shooting again, crossing some important levels. TSLA back to 850+. We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop. 

So i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out? We can circle jerk all day and cry about those hedge funds and the media and the manipulation like we've been doing for past two weeks. Or we can start looking for new plays and buy new consoles from GameStop. At least that's a better plan than just simply hoping to pump questionable DD posts to r/all and expecting momentum swing.

induldge me for a second as I stray a little from the hottest topics of this sub. I’m very interested in the $30B sextech industry for many reasons (people getting back together this summer, women’s empowerment, etc.) and know that many companies that fall in this category never get looks from institutional investors and are pretty beholden to crowdfunding and VCs.

I’m just your humble ape-retail investor, so my fanciest source for finding opportunities are usually common sources (SA, Google, etc.).  None of my queries have turned-up a sextech ETF.  Do they not exist?  And if not, why not? It’s a massive industry and there’s lots of money there.",2021-02-08 07:32:55

Probably all countries but I don't want to be definitive 

Likewise, you can only claim losses on your shares when you sell them. You cannot claim a deduction for unrealised losses

Lastly, it is illegal to sell your shares to realise the losses so you can claim a tax deduction and immediately buy shares back (it's called a wash trade). Don't do this either.

I've seen some stupid comments around here about people using their entire earnings to pay their loans or others claiming tax deductions on losses for shares they still own

Check your countries individual tax laws before spending any money or making any deductions. Calculate your tax obligations before spending a cent. If you can't, either get an accountant to do it or just wait to find out how much you owe. If you thought the stress of holding was bad, wait until you get audited.",2021-02-08 07:32:19

We traded down last week on an equity raise that was oversubscribed and upsized.

Quiet period is likely ending (not sure if this happens with SPACs), so you could see initiation reports from the big sell-side banks over the coming weeks.

Fundamentals of the business are strong with U.S. home prices + sales rising. Targeting $36-40 in the next two weeks and $60 after earnings.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.

Weekly Stock Market News🚀 | GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]🚀,6344,lfb2w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfb2w4/weekly_stock_market_news_goog_amzn_pins_sq_pypl/,361,1612817245.0,"**The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs🚀🚀🚀 Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out🚀🚀🚀 Let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the [DOW](https://imgur.com/NQpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [SP500](https://imgur.com/cY3wx9N) rose by 4.65% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/T5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November 🚀🚀🚀

The Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/Ki1RNHZ) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% 🚀

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square’s Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square 🚀

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 🚀

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 🚀

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 🚀

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company🚀🚀

Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January🚀

And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

"Discussion: Logically, GME short interest in the FINRA report should disappoint",773,lfa1vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfa1vf/discussion_logically_gme_short_interest_in_the/,261,1612813207.0,"**Disclaimer: I am not an experienced trader and this is not financial advice. I'm looking for a (serious) discussion and you're more than welcome to prove my logic wrong.**

The much anticipated FINRA report is published tomorrow after market closes. We're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. However, the way I see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their main strategy is one  of these two:

Case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. If they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. If this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. Their survival relies on retail investors selling due to FUD. All of this falls apart if FINRA reports a high short interest  tomorrow. Their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. If this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. The estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. It went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and I wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. In other words, even in this case the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. Otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). Essentially, if the FINRA report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. The hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.

TLDR: FINRA report bad, stock collapses (possibly momentarily) on Wednesday.",2021-02-08 21:40:07

The Jackals are always hungry and don't understand why, they will say anything for a meal, anything for you to come and join them, **in their misery**. 

The **Path to the Moon** has many twists and turns, Ups and Downs, it is important to remember this is an **energy flow at work**.

$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD,102,lf8e91,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf8e91/pcg_pge_california_utilities_dd/,91,1612805817.0,"**Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. 

**Summary**:

California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys – I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.

PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement

PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.

Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  

1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  
 The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. 

2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  
 $PCG’s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  

$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER—see item #1. This wouldn’t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  

This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. 

3) **Dividend and Leadership**  
 $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022—not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) 

Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it’s not like they’re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer’s Energy which was known for safety. She’s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock—I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). 

4) **Wildfires**  
 Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn’t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings—great entry point.

**Potential** **obstacles**

There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won’t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.

Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There’s always the potential for additional fines, but they’d be pretty inconsequential.

Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E—like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there’s that.

**MOAT –**   
 Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there’s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.

**WHY WSB?**

Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you’re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.

**EDIT:**
Thanks for all the comments/feedback.  

**RE: $PCG hatred.**  
Hatred 100% valid—it’s not going away.  They’re pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.  
It’d be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn’t need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It’s a monopoly.

**RE WSB u/ DD**
u/angela_lansbury busted me.  I’ve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users. 
That said, as long as I finally have a forum—I have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can’t tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I’ve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks.
My DD was tribute to this group.  I think there’s a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged—everyone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility’s coffers.
This isn’t a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it’s an investment I believe in.  I’m long on $PCG, but I also think there’s going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group.

**Edit 2**
Just realized my comment responses were getting blocked.

**Re: Erin Brokovich**

In 1995 the stock was at $30.25/share, then cratered to $20 with the $333m settlement in 1996, and then was $35/share in 1998

Another example:
The 2010 pipeline explosion affected share price. Pre explosion $48/ share.  Dropped briefly to $43, then back up to $48/ share three months later.

**Re: new utilities for counties.**
CCAs are not utilities.  They still need to use and pay to use PGE equipment (poles, wires).  CCAs contract generation.

**Re: $4.89/share**.  Users properly ridiculed you. The stock is in fact > 52 weeks old

**Re: my prediction EOY**.  Tricky with fire season, but 1q earnings 2022 guess would be $20.  Don't know why it isn't $18 today.

Another point to mention is that SRE earnings come out 1 week prior to PCG and should set recovery pace.",2021-02-08 19:36:57

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale,440,lf73yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf73yi/amc_major_stakeholder_wanda_converts_stock_to/,153,1612800002.0,"A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.

I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.

Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

* Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK
   * Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK
   * Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots
      * While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.
   * Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next
* Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.
   * I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.
* Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?
   * You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * ""Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!""
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 ""paperhand pussies"" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum
* Denying Reality
   * S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.
* Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions
   * When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN
* Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* I want to gag every time I see somebody write ""I'm not a financial advisor"" following a post that makes that very clear
* Moving the goalposts
   * ""YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!""
   * ""We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!"" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).
   * ""Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!""
   * ""Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!""
   * ""Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!""
* Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page

* Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * Market Manipulation --
   * No Pump & Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * Political Bullshit -- If you think ""it's not about the money"" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by ""This is not financial advice, am ape"") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.
      * Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.
* Gain & Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.
* YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.
   * [not a fucking YOLO -- it's a picture of a billboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la96zj/my_amc_billboard_is_up_in_kalamazoo_mi/)

   * I can't even find the others that I had in mind using the search tool because the entire list of YOLO's and DD's is filled with GME and AMC karma farming.
* And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.

You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?

If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.

But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.

Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue,110,lf5wgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf5wgk/geopolitics_and_semiconductors_taiwan_is/,114,1612794692.0,"So you’ve probably heard the news of Taiwan being “thanked” by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there’s some geopolitics behind this. 

There’s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. 

This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.

How? 

By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. 

The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it’s “now or never” before China reaches peer state status.

TLDR:

- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.

- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.

- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue

I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they’re going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla’s auto business: has a lot of potential and there’s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they’re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they’ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.

Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it’ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.


Tesla Semi: this is one I’m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer.

They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil 🛢, gold 🏆, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it’s time for that to turn around. [Excerpt](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-has-slammed-the-energy-sector-heres-a-hot-commodity-that-could-keep-rising-51589536800):

*Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.*

Uranium isn’t like oil, you can’t buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We’re at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see [this chart](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium) from the last time uranium went to the 🌕 from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:

*Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: ""History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production.""*

So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.

What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you’re subscribed to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.

Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like **Cameco (ticker $CCJ)**. It’s been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We’re not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so **it’s not going anywhere**. Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, you’ll see the same for their revenues.

Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose. That’s why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.

&#x200B;

**""Ladder""** is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates.

&#x200B;

*Legal Laddering ex:*

>***Bond Laddering*** can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. The idea is to separate CDs, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different ""ladders"" (or ""buckets"" or ""baskets"") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.  
>  
>This strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. Generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline.

&#x200B;

>***Short Put Laddering or Bull Put Laddering*** is a unlimited profit, limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term. To setup the short put ladder, the options trader sells an in-the-money put, buys an at-the-money put and buys another lower strike out-of-the-money put of the same underlying security and expiration date.

&#x200B;

*Illegal Laddering ex:*

>***IPO Laddering*** also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. This artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price. **This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse**.

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=1785342](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1785342)

\--------------------------------------

OK that was fun. We know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in ""Laddering"". We know that IPO Laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.

Now in the more in-depth version of the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how ""Naked Shorts"" can be combined with ""Laddering"" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. This is effectively what the blogger coined as the ""Short Ladder Attack"" strategy.

\------------------------------------

>***Naked Short*** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  
>  
>***The Anatomy of a Short Attack*** — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  
>  
>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill–gotten gain. (Click here for more on [**Bankrupting The Victim Company**](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS4BankruptingTheVictimCompany.html)).  
>  
>When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

[http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)

\------------------------------------

tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for ""short ladder attack"" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a Laddering price manipulation tactic combined with Naked Shorts. Both of those things are things.

I'm pretty retarded so I can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. You'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.

Yes, the concepts described in the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article are real things. You can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all ""laddering"" via shares neither party actually owns.

No, that doesn't mean that's definitely what happened w/ GME.

And No, you don't need a smoking gun to ask the SEC to investigate it.",2021-02-08 15:22:48

KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Kalamazoo man has paid for digital billboards referencing the Reddit group WallStreetBets and the short squeeze of hedge funds that have been occurring with stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.

Photos of the Save AMC billboard at the Wings Event Center are going viral on social media.

Brett Reath, the man behind the billboards, says he is poking fun at Wall Street and wants to bring attention to what hedge funds have been doing for decades by shorting stocks.

The messages will appear for a few days during the morning commute and evening rush hour.

“I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of shed light on the situation that’s been going on,” Reath said.

Reath says purchasing the advertising was not expensive, he paid $100 a day for two billboards to run in the rotation at set times.",2021-02-08 14:56:06

PDC Newsletter: Trading Week Ending 2/12,158,lf3ndh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf3ndh/pdc_newsletter_trading_week_ending_212/,56,1612786192.0,"Dear Member,

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.

Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.

1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot.
2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years
3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!

My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.

Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.

&#x200B;

* DIS (The Mouse)
   * It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.

&#x200B;

* CVS (You know you want to do it...)
   * WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: ""are the earnings already priced in?"" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $2.50 in price over the last week alone ($71.50 - $74.00). I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.

&#x200B;

* MARA + RIOT
   * I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and ""the halvening"" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.
   * According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.
   * MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.
   * RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* CCIV
   * CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.

Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data,229,lf1y46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf1y46/feb_9th_gme_short_interest_data/,215,1612780206.0,"I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29. 

If shorts settle T+2, and it’s only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor?

\#Innovation#

The company has been recognized for innovation; for example it has developed technologies that allow mobile phone batteries to be made at room temperature rather than in expensive, heated dry rooms.

In 2010, BusinessWeek ranked BYD the eighth most innovative company in the world [\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-businessweek-30) and that same year saw Fast Company ranking BYD as the 16th most innovative.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-fastcompany-31)

In 2017, PV Magazine has awarded BYD the top category of innovation on its newly launched battery storage system that advances progress in three categories: modularity, charging and discharging capacity, and efficiency.

TDLR: I think nobody talks about this company and feel price of stock will increase once more people start looking into other EV companies apart from the most popular ones.

The Future of Robinhood,61,lf14rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf14rc/the_future_of_robinhood/,47,1612777650.0,"I’ve been thinking about what becomes of a broker that can’t handle the stresses of volatile markets. We have a system where the strong survive and the weak get devoured. It’s hard to imagine Robinhood will endure given the events of these past few weeks, so what becomes of them? Well, they have something of value, but clearly do not have the infrastructure or the know how to swim in the ocean with the other sharks. It is my belief, that they will be acquired, and if I had to guess? It’ll be Goldman. The shiniest white shoes on the street have expanded into the consumer market with Marcus, and their biggest rival, Morgan Stanley, just bought E-trade. Acquiring a retail broker makes a lot of sense, but Goldman has had a problem. Who could they buy? In terms of US based brokers, all the appropriate sized acquisition targets had been picked off, until now. I think it would be a win-win, because ‘Robinhood, a Goldman Sachs Company’ solves a lot of problems. No one would ever question Robinhood’s solvency again. Goldman would oust the ‘broker bros’ like Vlad that clearly are in way over their heads, will gain millions of accounts, and strengthen their position in the consumer market.

Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD),2148,lf023x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf023x/why_to_really_buy_gme_solid_dd/,282,1612774092.0,"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). 

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. 

Fils-Aimé the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.
