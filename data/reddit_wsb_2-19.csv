Is this a stupid option play?,1,lna4w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lna4w0/is_this_a_stupid_option_play/,8,1613749234.0,"I've been investing in stocks for years, but now I'm a month into trading options. Im sure everyone is sick of reading that, sorry. Here's my idea, any input is appreciated. 
RIOT seems SUPER overvalued right now. 52 week low of $0.51, it closed today at $57.55. If I have a strong feeling the price will continue to plummet, how terrible of an idea of it is to sell calls that are months out, collecting that juicy premium with intentions of covering my position when the price falls to a more reasonable place? I can do the actual math myself for how low it'd have to fall to cover my position at a profit, I was more asking if anyone else has experience catching this type of knife. Thanks

Position idea: 
RIOT Sell $90C 06/18

Only Way Out For GME Shorts Happening Tomorrow...,72,ln9slr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln9slr/only_way_out_for_gme_shorts_happening_tomorrow/,21,1613747947.0,"Melvin's SEC Filing Led Me To the Answer... Why GME at $40 Matters Tomorrow...

I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what's going on with the options, and why shorts weren't worried about the share deliveries from contracts expiring tomorrow. While trying to work it out, I've been waiting for the quarterly SEC Filing from Melvin, and we finally got it on Feb 16.

On 2/16/21, Melvin reported a 6,000,000 share Put holding on GME. That is how they planned on covering this, and how I've been saying the shorts could have wormed their way out of this calamity every time someone posts ""they had no way out!""... Yah, actually they did, sadly...

Filing: https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/melvin-capital-management-lp

So, I went digging in the time machine to see what contracts were available on the option chain as seen on 12/31/20...

And come to find out, the strike max on any contracts (even all the way out to 2023) was $40 max.

https://i.imgur.com/PAvhWw9.jpg

Now, here's where I smelled the Fuckery cooking...

On 1/27/21, CNBC reported that Melvin capital closed out their short position that Tuesday (the 26th), for ""a huge loss"".

Tuesday would be the delivery date for the 1/22/21 options after T+2, so it makes sense on the surface...

Except that the highest strike price option available for purchase on or before 12/31/20 was $40... And 1/22/21 closed at $65.01...

There is zero way for any options that Melvin owned in December to have exercised to cover his shares on the 26th.

If Melvin went to market to buy the shares outright, 1/26/21 closed at $147.98. Even if he covered every share at max price, $147.98 x 6,000,000 (the number they were hedging) would only equal $887,880,000...

So, why the $3bil injection of funds?

Routers claims that Melvin started January with $12.5bil in capital and that it dropped to $5bil capital during the GME run, and ended at $8bil to close the month after the $3bil Citadel/P72 bailout.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-melvin-idUSKBN2A00KW

If they closed out on that Tuesday for $880mil, where did they lose the extra $7.5bil at?...

Even if they only hedged half their bet, and had 12,000,000 short positions to close, it would still only be $1.8bil on that Tuesday. (Much closer to the $3bil bailout, admittedly)

They would have had to have been short ~24,000,000 shares to lose $3bil... So why only hedge 6,000,000 of it?

Here's where it gets extra deep into the Fuckery...

The option contracts available on 12/31/20 go from:

2/12/21
2/19/21
4/16/21

They jump 2 months between contracts, and February 19 is the last exercise date available from a 12/31/20 purchase until April.

https://i.imgur.com/Ut6rpea.jpg

And the highest strike available to buy was... you guessed it... $40.

Tomorrow is the last day until April for those old $40 Put/Call options to finish in the money.

Any firm that tried to hedge their shorts with puts, even with max strike contracts, loses their Put options if the price finishes over $40 tomorrow.

GME short % of volume was 26% Tuesday, 23% yesterday, and 21% today.

One out of every Four shares sold this week has been a short... and now we know why.

If GME finishes over $40 tomorrow, any firm that was trying to cover their shorts through $40 Put options from December (or before) would be stuck buying shares to cover until April.

Any theta gang Call seller that posted $40 max strikes to collect Premium in December is also on the $40 line this week... But they'd need to purchase shares, or lose them if they were covered and still own them (theta gang sold their shares at $400 knowing they could buy them later for less, trust me...)

Now, I do realize that Melvin held 6,000,000 shares worth of options, and that there's less than 20,000 open interest (less than 14,000 now that I look... Over 4,000 have been taken off the chain in the last 48 hours...), but this explains the mad dash to $40...

The calls don't want to get exercised on, and the puts want their shares. They want it to $40 so badly, they've shorted an extra 8,000,000 shares this week alone.

What I don't understand is why those 1,800,000 shares are *so* important...

We had 24,000,000 in volume today. They could easily snipe 2mil shares in the course of a day or two...

...Unless all of the volume these last few weeks has been entirely the funds trading back and forth, and there's a LOT less public float than we thought...

There was a post earlier of a level 2 order page being constantly hit with 1 share and 0 (yes zero) share orders.

I'm starting to think that they are trading volume back and forth at the third/fourth decimal point with each other. Retail brokers can only do shares in two-decimal prices, ie $420.69... but market makers and the exchanges go to the third and sometimes fourth decimal point. The firms could be trading back and forth, on the books so it affects volume, at a decimal place that retail isn't allowed to access.

Brokers and market makers have a responsibility to give buyers the best whole-cent price, but scalping the spread is how the market makers take profit from order flows and how you get zero commission trades.

It could also be used as a loophole to keep retail from buying the shares that the firms are swapping. If the bid is $419.99 and a firm is selling at the price of $420.0005, but it would cost a retail buyer $420.01 (since we can only deal in whole-cents), it would allow another firm to snatch the shares ahead of retail between the spread. They would just enter a buy limit down to the .0005 decimal point, and take whatever small $420.00 shares are listed on the order book with it.

It would only cost $500 to add 1,000,000 in volume to the trading day at $0.0005/share (plus whatever shares they bought ahead of it).

I've been watching the level 2s from three different brokers, and there's never more than 20 orders total on the books for GME at any given time (and at least two of those are $6969.69 meme asks). Retail isn't selling, and I've never seen a 100k sell order on a book from an institutional holder. So the volume is coming from somewhere we don't have access to, even though it's counted in the daily trading volume...

I'm starting to think they are spoofing volume to make the market think shares are trading, when the pool is virtually dry in reality.

This shit keeps getting weirder...

To close: I actually do think Melvin is out. His Put volume that is no longer seen on the option chain, and his cash infusion both point to that happening. I do think others are fighting to finally dig themselves out of this hole, and tomorrow is their last chance... and I think they've been digging themselves deeper to try to make that happen.

460,000 shares are up for Call assignment if it stays above $40 tomorrow, and 1,370,000 Put shares don't get delivered if it stays above $40 tomorrow. That's $72,000,000 in shares that are being fought over just at the $40 mark...

(Another 1,200,000 put shares deliver under $48, and another 1,300,000 deliver under $50)

What I don't understand though... GME hit $48 during DFVs opening statement, and then we got hit with 4,000,000 short sale orders over the course of the rest of the day (finra).

Who shorts $160,000,000 to secure $72,000,000 in options? Interest on shorts rose from 1.08% Tuesday to 1.35% today. They've been adding more shorts by the day. Why are they shorting it so hard right after a mini-squeeze just happened and they *know* we aren't selling?

Open interest for $40 Puts on 2/26/21 drops off a cliff to 2,600 open contracts. There is something very special about this weeks options, but I don't have the entire picture of what or why yet...

(2 week delays in reporting are garbage for knowing the market today...)

Unless they know the shares aren't really there on the market to buy...

Oh, in other news, Jane Street just reported owning 1,500,000 in GME call shares and 1,070,000 in Put shares...

Https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/jane-street-group-llc

Jane Street Capital was the market maker that helped save the bond ETFs last year during the crash. When they step in to a large position, there's often a reason behind it.

I don't think this story is done being written yet...

I'm starting to think that those options are the last chance to get shares out of a dry pool...

~~

Edit for Tl;dr:

I think there's no shares on the market and the funds have been spoofing volume. 

The 2/19/21 options are the last options available to exercise from before the squeeze until April.

The highest strike available on those contracts at the time was $40.

Jane Street has  2.5mil in shares through option contracts somewhere on the chain. Jane Street is known for helping market liquidity during ""Oh Fuck"" situations.

This is affecting the market way more than just GME... We just haven't seen how or why yet...",2021-02-19 17:19:07

So needless to say most if not all of us have seem the shit show clown parade that was the Congressional hearing. A bunch of platitudes, useless verbal dancing around questions, nothing of value came out of this.I'm sure we will still be able to glean precious information from today's hearing, and you web sleuths will definitely be able to make a list of the important stuff we learned today (ie: squeeze not squoze CONFIRMED).

Obviously today no one asked the REAL questions about the important topics at hand:

1. Naked shorts
2. Short ladder attacks
3. Counterfit shares and Fail to Deliver on GME shares
4. DTCC being complicit in all this.
5. SEC themselves turning a blind eye to all this.

Since we are all owners of GME, we need to put our fate into our own hands and help ourselves. How? We need to change the narrative from talking about Robinhood and allowing virgin Vlad to speak for so long, to talking about the actual meat of the problem. We need to blast Congress to ask these important questions, and we need to do it today, and every day, until the next hearing.

I hope that one of us can actually piece together a succinct and to the point letter we can all tweet / email. With our numbers, we can easily make our case at least heard by those in Congress, and they'll be able to better formulate questions based on understanding what the real problem is, the DTCC allowing illegal trading activity to go on and the SEC not doing anything about it.

We can't just sit by and hope that these boomer congress people know what they're doing. We can't let the shills in Congress derail the narrative that the DTCC is at fault along with the HFs.

MOREOVER, we should continue to be of course diamond handing our shares and averaging down if possible and if our situation allows it. The squeeze def isn't squoze. The timer has been reset for the shorts, and even more gunpowder has been added to the powder keg with additional short positions opened. The counterfit shares are STILL out there. Short interest is STILL high. We are STILL holding. Nothing has changed, except that D-day is another day and we had a practice round in January.

Just some fuel to help you diamond hand this, Ryan Cohen created CHWY and their market cap is $45 Bil with shares at $110. The total addressable market for pet food is estimated to be $92 bil in 2020.

Ryan and team CHWY is now on board GME and the total addressable market for video games is $162 bil and $900 bil for computer hardware, since GME seems to be pivoting towards gaming hardware too, so you do the math. Price target of $200 in 5 years time (or however long you think it'll take Ryan Cohen to turn GME into a video game CHWY) is not a joke and is just based on fundamentals alone. All of us in under $200 / share are already set to profit in under 5 years time, meaning that even without the squeeze potential, GME has a great future. The squeeze is just the cherry on top of a great value play.

Side side note: Interesting experiment taking place in comments section.   
Notice how most of the comments are pretty negative towards GME. Now if the proportion of anti-GME comments vs pro-GME comments reflects the proportion of overall sentiment of WSB, then those negative comments should also all be upvoted as best comments.

The game is rigged and changes will only make it more rigged. All you can do and all you need to do is buy, hold, and consciously think ""fuck you"" to our political system every day. 

I had to watch the hearing after the fact tonight. There were definitely some fun points and I gotta admit it was fun seeing Vlad get grilled. That said, while I didn't expect anything huge or concrete from the politicians, I was going into this vaguely hopeful that there could be some real support for actually uncovering things wall street did and how we were screwed. Guess I'm still naive. 

To me it looks like most of the two parties are trying to take these lines:

Dems - ""All these retards are retarded! Vlad you're a piece of shit who let retarded people ride a regular bus but they obviously belong in a short bus. We need to burn Robinhood to the ground then create laws to keep these retards where they belong""

Repubs - ""Robinhood you're a real piece of shit... But gosh I can't hate you too much. You're stuck in these stupid regulations from the Dems. What we really need here is too free up wall st to do what they need and want to do. Did you know retail can't even buy unregistered securities? Obviously that's what got us here.""

In both cases we get screwed. 

This shit happened because wall st manipulated markets, sold naked shorts, and handcuffed retail when nothing else worked. Now we get David Scott asking if Robinhood had any way to monitor social media and block trades. What the absolute fuck...

How is anyone's conclusion from this that we need to put more restrictions on retail traders? For that matter how does anyone see this and think the issue is too few restrictions on wall st?

There were a few representatives asking decent questions, but they weren't leadership and they weren't the majority of either side. My main takeaway is neither side gives a fuck about the actual issues here. Everyone is focused on grabbing a little political capital by acting as a mouthpiece for populist anger then doing more to make the situation worse. 

Before I get into this next point, let me first say fuck Robinhood, for so many reasons, not just the restrictions on buying meme stocks. That said Robinhood is not at all the underlying issue here. They didn't use news organizations to try and push FUD to push prices down. They didn't short GME at 140%. They didn't use ladder attacks to drop the price. They didn't raise their own capital requirements. 

But that hearing was just everyone painting Robinhood as the evil behind it all. Both sides shat on Vlad for legitimate reasons and fucking retarded reasons like the fact they don't monitor social media to block specific trades. Then after shitting on Robinhood they pivot to their real target which was either more restrictions on us, or less on the people actually behind everything bad here.

Over the last 2 weeks the stock has fallen from around $40.00 to $25.00. This is due to an overreaction by the market. Today was the when the Palantir lock up ended where insiders first became eligible to sell 80% of their shares that before today weren’t eligible to be sold. The market expected PLTR to be dumped by the insiders who wanted to take profit but that didn’t really happen. If you were an insider and you wanted to sell, why would you unload your shares at $25 for like a 250% gain when you could sell them in a month after the sell off that the street thought would happen doesn’t and the stock is back up to $40 a share where you can unload them for $40. A lot of funds have been buying into PLTR including auntie Cathie who says the stock is destined for great long term growth. The company reported earnings this week and the earnings were actually really good but CNBC is attacking the stock trying to drive the price down. I think this is an attempt to get in lower because anyone who knows how to read a report knows that PLTR is a fast growing company with customers in the Global 100 and also Fortune 500 and has a lot of govt contracts so the sell off from 40 to 25 is an obvious overreaction anticipating a lockup selloff that didn’t happen and I see this going back to mid 30s very soon.

The SEC will not help the little guy,731,lmw7s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmw7s3/the_sec_will_not_help_the_little_guy/,51,1613708512.0,"  

The following narrative is a short explanation of why the SEC will not protect retail investors, nor will the prosecute in any serious way Hedge funds engaging in naked shorting. For that matter they will not seriously penalize RH for any unethical business practices.

The SEC is generally speaking a corrupt arm of the government, filled with inept lawyers who don’t know jack shit about how finances work, and the ones that do are crooked.

Harry M. Markopolos is a certified Fraud Examiner and  forensic accountant. He was also left the army as a Major, former infantry officer, 17 years of service Active Duty, Guard and Reserve.

In 1999 while Markopolos was employed by Rampart, he was asked to replicated Bernie Madoff’s successfull portfolio. It took Markopolos less than a day to realize that Madoff was running a large Ponzi Scheme. When the ponzi scheme crashed and burned, it was the single largest theft in the history of the world $65 Billion Dollars.

Markopolos travelled all over the world collecting evidence and files more that 12 complaints with the SEC and FBI office over a period of 10 years. The government came him the middle finger.

He testified before congress—more than 6 hours of video can be seen on SPAN, he named names of the crooked officials and inept clowns in the SEC.

He has had his life threatened repeatedly, for his whistleblowing.  This is all searchable on the internet, Wikipedia, News articles: CNN, FOX… yada yada yada…

Harry claims that the SEC is so tanked up with for Security Investors or compromised individuals, and that there whole goal is to keep the Wall Street Fraudsters in business, and will only come down on them when their business gets to out of hand, and could compromise the machine…

Kind of how the Mafia wouldn’t approve of dealing heroin.

He wrote a book documenting the fraud and corruption in the government with respect to Madoff’s case, entitled “[*No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Would_Listen)*”*",2021-02-19 06:21:52

But the people who are guilty of manipulating the stock market and fucking the Dumb Money retail investors (for all you smooth brains that means us) will get away with this again and again. Because American democracy is not built to hold the rich accountable. 

Sleeze balls will continue to not answer questions until the questioners time expires, and real answers will not be reached in this congressional hearing.  Plotkin and Griffin will continue to blatantly lie about naked shorting, ""following"" the rules and trading ahead of customers. The SEC *will not investigate them*. The SEC does not exist to protect retail investors.

Most of the time when CEO's or other leaders are brought in front of congress to testify they lie, avoid telling the truth, and try to get out of there as soon as possible. Because the **majority** of their target customers are NOT watching congressional testimony. 

But do not forget, **WE** are the fucking majority of Robinhood's customers. And we are fucking watching congressional testimony chewing crayons and cheering on our wife's boyfriend. We are 9 million strong and if we want anyone to make any changes after all of this we need to show who we support with our money. 

STOP using Robinhood if you don't like their practices! 

I have very little faith in the legislators getting this one right and actually passing laws that end up supporting retail investors and making it harder for hedge funds to manipulate markets.

Earnings were better than expected by a wide margin and there is hype for the full bronco rollout and EF series. At the same time they do still carry a large amount of debt. F’s p/e is also below every other major player in the auto space. We’ve seen it push over $12 a few times only to get shoved back under due to large selling pressure. Every time it has fully broken resistance in the last 12 months it has pushed up roughly $3 fairly quickly. With the recent frenzy in the market, EV hype, and a down market the last day or two people will get excited about a momentum EV play. Also it’s cheap, most people can afford a few shares, and anyone who gets a 1400 stimmy check can purchase 100+ shares or a few call contracts. It also seems to be forming a cup and handle within a pennant so we’ll see if it breaks above. Again with a solid break over $12 I think we see $15 that day or within the week. $20+ by EOY. Feel free to poke holes in the bull thesis in the comments. Also on the bear side if we break down through 11.25 the next support is a dollar below.

Palantir (PLTR) & What It Does,1547,lnfheg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnfheg/palantir_pltr_what_it_does/,363,1613769002.0,"**TLDR:  Long term hold, just now branching out into the private sector.**

Sup degenerates.  Scrolling through the Daily Discussion for the past few days I've seen a lot of misery surrounding PLTR because it's dropped freakin 10$ a share in the past week or so.  I'm struggling with you, but there is literally no downside to the stock.  The price has gone down because of some negative media attention, trying to drive the price down in combination with lockup expiry that happened yesterday.  TGIF and we're seeing some premarket action in a positive direction today.

But what does Palantir actually do?  That's the question everyone wants answered.  It's tough for people who aren't involved in the type of stuff the company does to understand, but there was a decent explanation done on Quora a few years ago that is still VERY relevant to the company, even as they branch out into the private sector.  Yes, they are still heavily involved in government contracts for the good ol' US of A and her allies, but now that it has a solid foothold and has developed its software to be crucial in development of foundational intelligence in a variety of government sectors, they are moving into spaces which are going to be more profitable for shareholders.

So here comes the Quora response.  It's from 6 years ago and comes from a blog that has since been upgraded to a full up website and this post has gone away from it, but it's still very relevant to the here and now even with the fast pace of technology today.  **Seriously, if you are in Palantir or are thinking about getting into it, read it.  It's a short read, and a good beginning for someone trying to figure out just what the fuck this company does.**

*By Kevin Simler*

I often ask candidates if they’re familiar with what we do at Palantir. Most people think they are. “Oh, you’re that data viz. company,” or, worse, “You guys do data mining, right?” At least they’ve heard of us and at least they’re on the right track, but I cringe anyway. We aren’t just a “data visualization” company and we don’t do “data mining.” It’s almost impossible to convey the scope and complexity of what we do in a few short minutes—or to do so without taking the conversation to an eye-glazing level of abstraction.

The following is my attempt at describing what we do at a high level without oversimplifying. I hope that after reading this a candidate will ‘get’ what we’re about, or at least understand enough not to apply tiny labels to our expansive vision.The problem: implementing analysisAt Palantir we specialize in **analysis**.Yes, that’s painfully abstract, and I’ll get to it in a second.In real-world terms, we are building a **software platform** that enables people to take whatever data is relevant to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before, using concepts that they already understand. And we are applying this vision, at first, to solving problems in the finance sector and the government intelligence community.The first important thing to note is that we don’t actually do the analysis ourselves. We don’t devise winning trading strategies and we don’t catch terrorists. We write software that enables other people to pull off these feats. These people, experts in their respective fields, are called \*analysts.\*So what exactly do analysts do? What is analysis?

>Analysis is everything necessary to extract **insight** from **information**.

Let’s break that down a bit.Information is easy: It’s data. It lives in a relational database or as files indexed on a hard drive, and you can easily run queries against it. It comes in two forms, structured and unstructured. And there is *a lot* of it in the modern world – too much, actually, for current tools to make sense of.Insight is trickier. Insight is something only a person can generate, and understanding this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis right. Thus the challenge of data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human intelligence. In other words, the challenge is how to *enable the analyst*.From the analyst’s perspective there are five essential features of an analysis platform:

1. First, and most important, ***the analyst should be in control***. In other words, the primary way of interacting with an analysis tool should be *human-driven queries*. While automated approaches can complement a human-driven approach, there simply is no substitute for human intelligence. Unless you put a person behind the wheel, the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original insight. Artificial Intelligence just isn’t there yet.
2. Ability to ***summarize large data sets***. Some of this is what has traditionally been called data mining: the largely automated approach—using machine learning or other statistical techniques—of processing lots of data at once and extracting nuggets that capture something interesting about the data. Unlike Palantir, traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis.
3. Ability to ***visualize large data sets***. Here the analyst wants interesting and informative ways of viewing data graphically, to make it easier for him to digest. The analyst wants more than just a summary of the data; he wants a nuanced view of what’s going on*inside* these data sets: What’s the overall shape of the distribution? What are the outliers? What are important structures within the data?
4. Ability to ***iterate rapidly***. This means enabling the analyst to ask a question, get the answer, and then quickly ask either a variant on the initial question or a follow-up question that depends on the answer to the initial question. This rapid, iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test out hypotheses and develop theories about what’s going on in the data, and by extension to discover what’s going on in the world.
5. Ability to ***collaborate with other analysts***. Getting a handle on a terabyte of data, especially when it comprises multiple data types, is definitely more than a one-person job. Any organization that’s serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts that can work together as more than the sum of its parts. This requires the ability for one analyst to effortlessly share the results of his analysis with his colleagues.

The Palantir approachThat’s what analysis looks like to the analyst, or rather what it should look like in an ideal world. (Current tools fall far short of this vision.) So what do *we* do at Palantir in order to make analysis this smooth and easy?You could say that we help summarize large data sets, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a rich library of techniques and algorithms. You could also say that we do visualization, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a set of interesting and informative ways of visualizing their data. We do both of these things, and we have to be creative and solve hard problems in order to add value in these areas. But we do a lot more than that.Probably the most central hard problem that we address in trying to enable the analyst is **data modeling**, the process of figuring out what data types are relevant to a domain, defining what they represent in the world, and deciding how to represent them in the system. At Palantir we make sure our data model (ontology) is both flexible and dynamic, and that it mirrors the concepts people naturally use when reasoning about the domain. This is no small challenge, but we’re already making it a reality. In finance our basic data types include financial instruments, dates, portfolios, indices, and strategies—the same things that financial researchers think about, talk about, and reason with. In the intelligence product our basic data types include people, places, and events (all with associated properties), which is exactly the way we all represent the world in our minds.Data modeling, data summarization, and data visualization are the core disciplines for approaching large data sets. Human-driven queries, rapid iteration, and collaboration are multipliers, taking the power unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level. When these pieces are brought together in a coherent system, the result is in an analysis platform both very generic and very powerful.This is what we mean when we say that we’re changing the way people approach data. Welcome to the future of analysis.

I was just interested in this bad girl so here is the dd if it can be interesting for some of you!

**Industry Analysis**

The internet industry is nothing new, let's face it, but the problem with it is that it is expensive to bring good and reliable internet to remote places like Ohio or Canada. Bringing a cable that costs thousands of dollars per meter to connect a couple of retards in the outback is not the best move telecommunications companies can do. But as usual. Elon Musk believes that everyone should have access to fast and reliable connection which is why he decided to create a company to fix this problem.

With the covid we are also seeing another exodus from the city, people are beginning to be more interested in moving out and if they can have fast and reliable access to the internet far in the woods or near the beach, remote work is going to keep getting bigger and more interesting for employees. On a personal note, I currently have two jobs and since the beginning of the pandemic I have been working from home for both. After meeting with the direction for each job, the productivity of the employees has not been impacted at all and I don’t think that every employee will be coming back to work once it is done because we saw that remote work was not only possible but was also as much productive and much more convenient for some of us.

SpaceX mentioned to their investors that Starlink is trying to enter the $1 trillion market of the internet market all around the world. They also stated that it would cost around $10 billion to build their network. They planned to reach a revenue of $30 billion to $50 billion a year according to their research. Musk announced the project and in less than 2 months, they received more than 700 000 applications across the United States, not bad at all!

**Company background**

Starlink is a satellite internet provider constructed by SpaceX (if you don’t know who is SpaceX, go take a run on the highway with your eyes closed plz) their goal is to bring fast and reliable internet to everyone but will focus on rural and remote communities at first.

They began their product development back in 2015 and are now testing their product in the US, Canada and UK.

Financials

We don’t have much information about the financials of Starlink at the moment, we know that they are backed by SpaceX and the owner is the richest man on the planet, or the second richest depending on when you look at the list.

**The Product**

Now you may ask (or probably already know) how can they achieve that? Well Musk is the owner of a small company that is launching rockets in space, after some thinking he came up with his team with the idea to launch thousands of satellites in orbit to create a whole constellation that would make the internet accessible everywhere.

They began the development of their product back in 2015, launched their first two prototypes in 2018 and added 60 more in 2019. They are currently using the Falcon 9 to launch 60 satellites at a time and on January 17th it was their 17th launch that brought the total amount to a total of about 960 satellites in orbit. They also had another launch a couple of days ago and sadly, the rocket landed somewhere in the ocean instead of on the landing pad and they were not able to recover it. (I would like to mention that it was the 6th time they were using it, still a fucking legend to my eyes)

Can you currently use their service?

Yes but no. The registration is open on their website but you need to be in certain areas and there are a maximum number of people that will get it for now since it is still in beta.

Now one concern could be: How good is it really? Because we already have internet connection from satellites at the moment with company like Xplornet and the connection is fucking sh\*t and expensive af for nothing (link in sources) Well Starlink is far from being the same, while Xplornet is using only TWO satellites that are at 36 thousand kilometers from earth, Starlink are planning to have 42 THOUSAND satellites in orbit at less than 500 kilometers from earth. It will probably never be as good as fiber but it will still be very fast and available everywhere (and incredibly better than what is currently available right now). It is also going to indirectly (and maybe directly in the future) compete with the 5g network that is coming up soon but I don’t think it should be a major concern for the moment! (Daddy Musk, please leave a chance to Nokia to live and prosper with their 5g network)

How expensive is it?

For the moment, for the “testers”, if you want to get your hands on starlink internet you will need to pay an upfront fee of $499 to get your starlink kit (terminal to connect to the satellites and wifi router) and a $99/month. We don’t have any information about the future price of such service but I assume that like drugs, the more customers they will have, the cheaper it will get.

**Possible IPO**

Yes you heard it correctly, Elon actually considers making an IPO for Starlink, the king of twitter posted an answer saying that it is a possibility but that he only consider doing that in a couple of years when the revenue growth will be “smooth and predictable”

So of course that is making me really sad because I would like to spend a couple grand on this man’s idea but he is a smart man and who knows, maybe it will be sooner!There are rumors that the blank company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd which just went public btw, could be the perfect fit for that matter, there is a post from another user that I recommend reading if you are interested in those kinds of things.

**Does it make sense? (AKA Conclusion)**

I am a big fan of Elon Musk, I am not afraid to say that I would probably follow him in each and single one of his projects and invest if given the opportunity. To be honest, the balls on this man and the discipline mixed with his stubbornness to make the world become a better place is truly amazing.

The main competitor would be amazon who is also planning to launch their satellite internet in the future with their project Kuiper, they have not communicated any timeline yet which could mean that Starlink would be the only one in the field for a couple of months (most likely years).

I still think that with his leadership and the resources available for Starlink, the project is bound to be a success, I also believe that it is only a test to see if his idea could work before taking it to Mars so I am not concerned at all by his ability to become one of the biggest internet provider on the planet.

PLTR and the battle between institutional vs retail investors ownership,252,lndogm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lndogm/pltr_and_the_battle_between_institutional_vs/,129,1613762826.0,"Soros said publicly he was going to sell all his shares as soon as legally allowed, that would have been yesterday when the lockup period expired, hence 300M+ volume. if he did close his position and would be interesting to find out, his shares will have been snapped by other institutions, together with all other shares sold by paper hand retail investors whom fell for the trap.

PLTR is a one in a life time stock to buy, at this price, as it will undoubtedly become a household name in the next 5 years. 

Ive been long since its DPL last autumn and have been adding whenever i can. 

the one is thing i am sad about is that Karp wanted PLTR to be accessible to retail investors rather than WS, hence the direct listing route. His decision has been met with bitterness, resentment and dirty tactics to influence retail investors via some crooks media outlets, as particularly witnessed in the last few weeks. unfortunately, i suspect that soon enough institutional ownership will far exceed retail investors ownership. 

nevertheless, 

the future is bright, the future is PLTR!",2021-02-19 21:27:06

TLRY and PLTR Speculation for Friday Based On My Own Extra Chromosomes! How Putting a Potato In Your Gameboy Shows Both MIGHT Still Dip Tomorrow!,120,lnaemm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnaemm/tlry_and_pltr_speculation_for_friday_based_on_my/,66,1613750263.0,"All I can present is some data and charts on possible movements in price based off of market volumes swinging in similar manners. Want more details what everything means, check out my old posts referencing my super powers of autism!

**Basic Premise:**

* If different market short volumes start to rise and peak together, that stock dips the next day(s)

**What's Happening:**

* TLRY had the sync and peak happen already, but still has some to go.
* PLTR dived into an empty pool, and the short volumes should have backed off, but they've doubled down, and now they brought in pretty HIGH short exempt volumes

**What's it Mean Then:**

* TLRY could still fall!!!
* PLTR is in Round 5 of the ""Getting the Shit Beat Out of You"" competition, and def winning there, and we might be looking at Round 6 tomorrow before the judges call it.

&#x200B;

TLRY has had the short exempt volume drop significantly! THANK GOD! My only hesitation before buying into the dip is the slight rise on Thursday, look at the bright teal line. The short volumes do appear to be slightly rising going into Friday though, so expect some action in the near future.

https://preview.redd.it/kz8xuhh4pdi61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=069e9908bd7142eeb7d7fa8cf9d45cf46085eadf

I think we'll see TLRY fall below the $27 mark, and see support at $25. I think it'll hold, **HOWEVER, don't be surprised IF** we see a dip below that, there's still 1.5MILLION short exempts out there too for some more top-notch-fuckery.

https://preview.redd.it/0mvwewrwtdi61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=63afe390bff3bb0536093eee35f1301c94dc77fb

=============================================

For PLTR, the short exempt volume **hit a new high Thursday for this year**, and the short volumes from **FINRA and NASDAQ PSX both climbed!**

\--->  **THIS IS USUALLY A BAD SIGN!!!**

* See how the yellow line, off-exchange numbers from FINRA, dipped Wednesday, then went higher than Tuesdays!???
* And the bright blue(teal?) line is at its highest now, that's short exempts, which I have a personal history with because they usually shit themselves in elevators and walk out!

https://preview.redd.it/6fr1g0utmdi61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50125d21b35979a5d23d433a7219621541b9afa

https://preview.redd.it/twodqlhxtdi61.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e438aa5b7ef493f266c99f47c6cf0e0eef1586

I think we're going to see some real volatility tomorrow, down to $23 and if it can't hold there, then down to $22, AND PLEASE DEAR GOD MAKE IT THE FLOOR!

==============================

I believe, like many of you, that these two are are WAY UNDERVALUED! I've read estimates for TLRY to $60, and PLTR to $70, but you're reading this now, so who the hell knows!

==============================

&#x200B;

**TLDR: DON'T TRUST STRANGERS ONLINE!**

* Not financial advice, but **BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!!**
* **TLRY** shorts look like they've finally beaten the hell out of it and their volumes fell Wednesday, but they also went up slightly Thursday, maybe preparing for another incoming dip, unclear at this point.
   * **Still might beat it down to $ 25 tomorrow** and if it gets down anywhere near $20 expect a rubberband in the future, and I'm trading in all my crayola's to buy in.
* **PLTR** has **gone down 5 days in a row BUT THE SHORT VOLUME HAS REMAINED HIGH?!** and the short exempt volume is the highest for all of 2021!
   * **PLTR isn't done falling,** and **short exempt volumes can drag out recovery.**
   * If that shit falls anywhere near $23 I'm selling my good kidney to get in there!
   * (**CHARLIE IN THE MAIN ROOM RANT**) IF THE SHORT EXEMPT VOLUMES GO DOWN tomorrow, expect a rise next Monday and Tuesday. IF they use them Monday, expect the price to stay low Monday also and recovery sometime next week. (**END WILD SPECULATION WITH NO PROOF)**

**EDIT For PreMorning:**

* 4:15am: TLRY -1%, PLTR +8%
* 6:10am: TLRY +3.7%, PLTR + 5.16%
* 8:30am: TLRY +2, PLTR +6.75%
* 9:25am: TLRY +2.88%, PLTR +6.75
   * So let's hope my post was completely wrong and we ride up to $50 for both

**EDIT: TinFoil Hat Theory:**

Premarket activities on the 16th were up, and so were short exempts, then we saw a MASSIVE sell off.What if the price is allowed to rise in premarket, then they flood it with sell orders they bought yesterday at lower prices, and you can use short exempts on the downticks too, further driving price down?--> Huge selloff early morning to try to scare people from buying in and driving price below $25 (where everyone thought safe)

Edit: Anyone else watching the candles at market open, because they're were FLYING up green, and then they just go to neutral?!",2021-02-19 17:57:43

This company caught my eye because if my understanding is correct, they are working with FSR(symbol FSR) which is 1 of 3 companies running for a bid with USPS of over 6 billion dollars. I am unsure of the where and when but I haven't stopped digging.

Feb 23, Earning's report will come out. I'm expecting stock to drop and I'll do a buy in at that point. These guys are in the early stages but I have seen some promising information passing the screen about them.

But I am only and ameba hoping to evolve into an ape.  I'd appreciate any feedback on, other things to consider in my hypothesis. This is in  'NO WAY' advice for anything, especially NOT for investing.  This is merely a near futile attempt to gain attention from you guys wile my wife's boyfriend services her.

"GSHD up +1300% in 2 years, exploding in price by exploiting their workers. A management team this sociopathic is guaranteed to send this stock over $200 by summer!",5,ln9w1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln9w1v/gshd_up_1300_in_2_years_exploding_in_price_by/,24,1613748321.0,"GSHD has absolutely exploded in value the last 2.5 years since its IPO. It’s gone from $12 to $167.  They are a TX based insurance broker that trades like an insuretech startup. 

So what’s so innovative about this insurance broker who wants to call you up and sell you car and home insurance?  

Well they separated sales and customer service into two different jobs. Yes that is basically the entire innovation of their business model. Otherwise it is basic insurance broker sales. 

Their website is basic as hell and will make you nostalgic for the early 2000s, and this thing trades at a 345 P/e.

Their other innovation is not giving a shit about their workers.  They start these guys at like 40k a year and terrible benefits and move them to big expensive cities like Austin TX.  And then they make them work 60 hour weeks for 40k and pretend they wouldn’t be better off working at fucking Wendy’s! At least there they’d get some free tendies 

If you haven’t heard Austin hasnt had power or water for about a week in most of the city. So what does management do to help out their employees? They are going to have to work even longer the entire weekend, after sleeping on their freezing floors and melting snow for 5 days to survive. They are legitimately calling them in to work the entire weekend at the office because power was restored.  And for those without power at home they can’t even bring their freezing families in to get warm. 

So props to management for getting rid of all empathy and taking on their sociopathic pursuit of profit above all. That’s the kind of management drive a company like this needs to get above $200 by end of April.

April $200 calls for $5 a piece look like a bargain, time to pounce WSB!

GME and Call/Put parity.,79,ln9a6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln9a6g/gme_and_callput_parity/,39,1613746126.0,"I've noticed a big divergence in the spread between the prices between Puts and Calls on gamestop.

Usually if such a divergence in pricing doesn't exist because of dark pools and market makers doing risk free arbitrage.

Like right now you can create a synthetic short by selling an ATM call and buy an ATM put and assuming the midway prices between the ask/bid you would get 58 cents. 

You would then be able to lock in that credit by buying a share of gamestop.

Literally risk free money right there. 

Now I know this is dark pools bread and butter so I'm wondering how does this opportunity exist.

Only thing I can think of is they can't find the shares to hedge the arbitrage.

Anyone have any insight?

Right now call volume to put volume is about 2 to 1

Open interest on the other hand there is about twice the number of puts then calls.

Expiring tomorrow there is about 129,000 calls expiring and about half are out of the money but 20,000 are at $45 and 30,000 at 50 according to barchart.com

That's about 50 million shares they would have to buy if it goes in the money on a 50million float that market makers would have to buy.

Edit:Nobody arbitrage this it would only work if you had crazy leverage available and orders processing through you. Like if you were a dark pool. If your a retail buyer your just going wind up getting assigned.

I'm only asking why does this exist and to such an extent. Hedge funds know this opportunity exist. They snap this stuff up in seconds. So why aren't they snapping this up.",2021-02-19 16:48:46

Why im bullish on FuelCell,16,ln90vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln90vi/why_im_bullish_on_fuelcell/,52,1613745226.0,"So far since i have started investing in $FCEL , it has gone up for me and I believe this stock has a lot of potential. 

This stock has closely followed its competitor $PLUG , where good news for them also meant an increase for $FCEL , although not as much. However, this stocks value has gone up in a more consistent way and the graph seems to show a pattern of growth. Let me Demonstrate.   
The Pattern: [https://ibb.co/b5zNt48](https://ibb.co/b5zNt48)  


So taking this pattern into perspective, the graph is repeating but relatively bigger, in a Fibonacci pattern.  Using this logic, we are at the bottom of a new sequence, and the come-up part of the pattern will grow relative to the value during this time. 

So my conclusion is that, this is the prime buyin point for this stock, as it is at the lowest point of its new growth cycle.  
I also have hopes for the electric car industries future. Seems like a really attractive future to me.

EDIT 1: Apple recently announced that they’re putting their foot in the door in the EV industry, as soon as that happened, the stock shot up and gained a new resistance point. So I expect when Apple releases further development in their line of EVs, the stock will benefit from the news and go up fulfilling its rally point.",2021-02-19 16:33:46

It is great how some representatives are even straight up roasting and calling out the lies of the witnesses for the record.

It all makes for a great show....

But what’s more important is the results that come from these hearings.

We need to be steadily aware of what is happening during these meetings so that the people who represent us bring about the desired results and actions.

We all want for Melvin, Citadel, RobinHood, the DTCC, and other brokerages/hedge funds to pay for what they did; because it’s only fair that the rules that apply to us also apply to everyone else.

We also want revenge upon these organized bodies for the potential gains they robbed us of just because they didn’t like the fact that they were losing billions over their own greed and corruption.

But right now, there’s also a push of a separate agenda; to add regulations upon stock trading that will have a negative effect on retail traders.

We need to ensure that the free market remains a free market, and that those who were found to have broken the law are punished.

In-Depth Analysis of Todays Hearing - and their potential game plan,156,ln7ycq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln7ycq/indepth_analysis_of_todays_hearing_and_their/,65,1613741673.0,"So after watching my second time through, I’ll explain what I’m 99% sure is going on, then post my congressman shit list like some have been asking for along with kick ass ones too!

First, there’s a large attempt to shift the narrative away from potential collusion and place the blame solely on RH. 

Second, there is an attempt by citadel and RH to use this crisis to get what THEY want. They want instant settlement and dark pools on the open market. This is their game plan. This would allow them to hold less for settlement and use more of their money to fuck you over! It would also give them more access in taking on the bigger fish by getting rid of dark pools. I imagine there are some pension funds etc that also use dark pools. This is all their narrative to help them become bigger fish! Note Vlad didn’t like 1 day settlement.

Third, there was one question about the danger of options trades. The congressman who asked is on my shitlist. However during the hearing RH disclosed how they’ve made 5x more money since allowing options i.e. its likely they’ve been fucking over your options trades.

Fourth, this liquidity problem was made up behind closed doors! They made up this problem so they didn’t have to perjur themselves. Evidence of this is THE MOST important question was asked by David Houstoff of TN, if it wasn’t for the settlement time this wouldn’t have happened? 
Vlad is a shitty liar and sidestepped slightly by not fully answering, he said it would avoid some of the problems. I.e. they never had an intention of letting this trade go through even without this “crisis”.

Five, these asshats keep acting like Vlad speaks for retail, yet DFV is literally at the hearing?! Like WTF! 

Six, why ask these corrupt fucks for ANY suggestions? They used it to advertise, act as if they care about retail, and push their wish list.

Seventh, very important, when citadel was asked about the DTCC he looked to the left during his response. Clear sign of lying, but speculation I guess. 

Lastly, Melvin sounded like a little bitch and his office looked empty. He seems like a bit of a tool but mostly answered questions and openly admitted to making a program to monitor us. Haha he’s a sore loser 😂 


So please, contact your congressman and address these concerns you have, likely if they aren’t on the shitlist? At least, if you feel that giving citadel more free money to move the markets via real time settlement is a bad idea. 

Lastly, the shitlist, note I have some on the fence but some are also here because the later the hearing went the less it seems important to ask Vlad the same bullshit questions. The on the fence ones I have currently I’ll review and maybe update with later (not on this list). 

Also I have reasons and if you want to know I’ll reply to each one specifically and probably post a pdf later.

Let me emphasize what truly is at stake here, besides the potential that the universe could have revolved around GME. This is one of the best opportunities we have right now to either change the system in our favor OR have the system fuck us over even further. That simple.

Before I list let me start by saying I've studied events exactly like short squeezes years back for weeks, been following GME since October, bought at $60, sold at $420, and more or less been lurking you guys for a while longer. 

# List of questions:

* Why do we not have a blockcha!n based settlement process already?
* When can we expect to see a blockcha!n based settlement process implemented?
* What progress has the DTCC made on a blockcha!n based settlement process and how will you continue to communicate the progress?
* How can GME have over 100% (currently 122.04%) institutional ownership? 
* How much of the float of GME do ONLY the retail investors own?
* Their are indeed legal ways that a stock can have over 100% short interest but let's specifically ask what are all the illegal ways a naked short position can be created?
* What are strategic failure to delivers?
* What are phantom shares?
* What prevents phantom shares from being created?
* Who were ALL the parties involved that created phantom shares in GME? Just 1 or all?
* Is the punishment for creating phantom shares greater then the reward for obtaining lot's of interest free money?
* What happens to the price of a stock when someone floods the market with a huge constant supply of phantom shares?
* In what ways can phantom shares be used to decide which companies get to have a fighting chance and which companies get to have their faiths sealed? 
* Why did it take WEEKS to find all of Michael Burry's shares?
* Are the shorters of GME the one's we should truly be paying the most attention to or is shorting just a result of trying to make money off a much much more nefarious thing at play here? 
* What happens to all the retail investors who own fake shares of GME if the GME board of directors were to call in ALL the real shares back?
* How many institutional investors where also buying alongside retail investors?
* How much of the GME buying volume was from buying to cover/close?
* Why did short's not cover when the price went to as low as $3 and simply lock in profits then?
* Do shorters need to pay taxes if the company they short goes bankrupt and thus don't need to ever realize their gains?
* Who owns the DTCC?
* Did anyone who partially owned the DTC have a short position in GME?
* Who at the DTCC decided to raise the requirements?
* At the end of the road if none of the broker's or market makers have the collateral, who foots the bill?
* Why did the DTCC notify brokers that early in the morning? 
* Who where the one's buying put's on GME right before Robinhood restricted buying?
* Why did the DTCC not chill and/or freeze GME?
* Are we perhaps putting TOO much focus on Robinhood and not enough focus on the DTCC's role  that lead up to all broker's having to do what they ended up doing?
* The fact is that Payment For Order Flow allowed for zero commission fees BUT what are ALL the potential NEGGATIVES of PFOF? 
* Why do many of us think the short squeeze is over?
* How can we verify the authenticity of the short interest data?
* Who right now even at this very moment are the one's selling shares of GME? 
* Which recently created LLC's/shell companies and similar entities started doing ANY transactions involving GME?
* What type of transactions where those newly created entities doing? 
* How extremely risky were those transactions by those newly created entities?
* Who any shape or form was related to the creation of those newly created entities?
* **Perhaps after all of this the average American will still be clueless as to what exactly happened, but how will all of this shape the way in which private companies, companies with actual knowledgeable financial departments/divisions who may be deciding on whether or not to go public/have an IPO feel?**

This should be a little scary to all of us. The idea of having HF software scouring all of our conversations so we will never have the advantage over them (implied from what he said), is creepy.

There's an old saying,"" when the enemy tells you what they are going to do, believe them."" They admitted that they use the game to gleen money by getting us slightly less favorable trades. Now they are telling us they will be taking us into consideration and monitoring us. Who the fuck is monitoring them?

The champions were the congress people who spoke for the retail investors getting screwed. The catch 22 is that about 9 of the people on that committee including Maxine waters (who appeared impartial) will be looking at what to do, and more regulation and taxes are their answer for everything. Again, when they tell you they want to do something, believe them!

The upside? Plotkin said covering shorts didn't cause the elevated price,so that means the squeeze is still in our future. Also, u/deepfuckingvalue said its a good value at current price.

GameStop’s website update and plans starting to emerge,798,ln50hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln50hs/gamestops_website_update_and_plans_starting_to/,158,1613732649.0,"So a while ago there were rumours posted about the potential GameStop stores turning into semi computer shops where people can go and build their pcs and buy parts.

Looking at their website now they posted a catalog of pcs and laptops available to buy, so they are making moves Into that direction it seems.

Also I’m not sure if this was a thing before but they have a platform where you can guy and download games directly from their application, so it seems like they’re going towards the steam etc direction of having their own store installed directly on people’s computers!

&#x200B;

In a neat little town they called Brockton

In GME trade i was bound

And many an hour of due diligence

I researched in that neat little town

&#x200B;

Then bad misfortunes befell me

That urged me to stray from my plan

But yet did I know that they'd guide me

To unfold these sick diamond hands

&#x200B;

As I was researching one evening

Not intending to short or go long

Up came some attractive financials

With deep value just slipping along

&#x200B;

With both shares and long calls on my docket

I prepared for returns oh so grand

And concluded right then and right there

To brandish these sick diamond hands

&#x200B;

(Chorus)

The stock, we like it, we love it

We've made it a part of the plan

To hold it, and never forsake it

And hold high, these sick diamond hands

&#x200B;

Now the hedgies and brokers are calling

They got fukt in a fashion so grand

And far away from my friends and companions

They called me to Congress to stand.

&#x200B;

Now with Melvin and Kenny and others

I appeared, so righteous and glad

Sustained by my headband and kitty

I showed them these sick diamond hands

&#x200B;

(Chorus)

The stock, we like it, we love it

We've made it a part of the plan

To hold it, and never forsake it

And hold high, these sick diamond hands

&#x200B;

So come all, you merry young traders

I'll have you take warning from me

Pay no mind to the Vlads and the Melvins

Hold that stock, you'll be wealthy and free

&#x200B;

They'll twist you, the crooks they'll aggress you

They'll endeavor to shatter your plan

Take a lesson from DeepFuckingValue

Our boy with the SICK DIAMOND HANDS!

Origin story - so as soon as I heard that DFV was from Brockton, this song got stuck in my head and wouldn't leave.  It plays in my head any time I see that town referenced.

Europoor point of view on GME and Robinhood restrictions,243,ln42bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln42bu/europoor_point_of_view_on_gme_and_robinhood/,51,1613729807.0,"I've watched the entire congress live stream today and I realized that was only US centric. _(We own GME also in other part of the world, I hope they will start to realize this as soon as possible, we depends on your regulation...)_ 


I'm an Europoor who is in GME since November, I own a lot of shares (own for real, my shares cannot be lended) and even after today I'm still green. 


I've followed the GME story everyday since November and I think I haven't miss anything. I also created a meme back then (sometimes I would have preferred to be a real dumb, it would have been better for my sanity) 


I haven't sell not because I'm greedy but because based on my DD, my exit strategy and the GME chart, I was pretty sure that the price could have easily been over $500. _(If you bought at over $300 you should not feel dumb, it's not entirely your fault)_ 


#### I just would like to remind everyone (especially those of you who are in the USA) that the Robinhood restriction haven't impacted only Robinhood users, it has impacted ALL OF US. 


I'm not a Robinhood user, so how am I supposed to know at the same time as a Robinhood user that there are buying restrictions?  


Ok, you want to protect your customer (yourself), but you're penalizing all the other people in the market. Who is willing to protect us? 


I'm sorry but i don't give a fuck about your apologies, with them I wipe my ass! 


I'm frustrated, I lost faith in the system, I can't wait for this to be over so I can move completely away from the traditional and old stock market _(hint: we already have alternative stock market solutions that will let this shit never happen again)_ 


For the moment there is not much I can do, I'll continue to hold my beautiful shares and hope (yes hope, because it's not a free market and if someone doesn't like your stock, all your DD are worthless) that some serious action will be taken. At the and mine is/was a value play, the squeeze is/was just the icing on the cake and at the end, as DFV said at this price is still a stock that is worth buying. 


Sorry for this but I feel the need to share a small part of my thoughts in this moment with someone who can understand my feelings.

The hearing today made it clear that the DTCC is where potential fraud/collusion took place. Failure to question the DTCC makes these hearings largely a sham. The DTCC effectively put a gun to the head of Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev by demanding immediate posting of billions in USD as collateral, forcing him and other brokers to shut down retail buying of GME stock. The DTCC is an industry consortium, and its board members are elected by the DTCC's users (market makers, brokerages, and exchanges). This leads to a conflict of interest wherein the DTCC has an incentive to (for instance) stop trading of securities that may result in losses to those entities. Given that this immense power held by the DTCC is largely enabled by gov't financial regulation, the DTCC should be controlled by the public/gov't. Please, advocate for us citizens.

They fucked us. Tenev was complicit and made a decision to fuck over his users. But let’s not forget who he responds to. He made a choice to save his company and suck off his superiors. It was a choice out of greed and corruption, but when he says he felt “powerless” I’m inclined to believe him. This is how corruption works. It makes people below feel like they have no choice.


In the end, he had a choice, but I sympathize with him a little bit. Even if he doesn’t deserve it. There is this narrative being driven to make Robinhood the fall guy, but let’s be real. Without Robinhood’s trading access to the retail investor (shadiness aside), I don’t think we would have had the steam to even make this GameStop saga happen. Which by the way is still not over.


Robinhood and Tenev should be held accountable. But our focus should be on the market makers who put them in that position. The people who egregiously shorted GameStop and constantly manipulated and engage in illegal activities. The people who Robinhood bows down to. They clearly want to make Tenev the fall guy. Let all the outrage onto him, but they don’t give a fuck if Robinhood fails. I know it sucks Robinhood left a lot of people bagholding, (for now, dfv baby) but we have to remain cognizant of why they did it in the first place. Fuck Ken Griffin and his balding dumbass. Man clearly had multiple lawyers with him and was reading off a teleprompter. Fuck Gabe Plotkin. Fuck everyone else like them who poison our system with greed and corruption.

"Borrowing Shares, the conundrum ... A regulation I would actually agree with.",41,ln3yik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln3yik/borrowing_shares_the_conundrum_a_regulation_i/,38,1613729485.0,"Watching the hearing today and just thinking about how and why short selling exist in the first place all revolves around borrowing Shares from owners... Many people I know and talk to don't realize that your brokerage pretty much has the right to borrow your shares to short as they see fit unless you contact them and disable it. This is typically done on margin accounts where you actually don't really own the shares that you have on margin until you can cover your position.

There are also brokerages that will lend out your shares with out telling you, some will ask you to allow them to borrow at a percent return but we all know that's a pretty shitty statement when those shares are typically used to force the price of the stock down resulting in a net loss.

I propose a regulation that every broker needs to have an on/ off switch for every position you currently hold in order for you to allow a share to be borrowed or not... This also needs to be accompanied with the current borrow Interest rate on your borrowed stock as a return percentage. You own the stock and can make an informed decision as to whether or not you are willing to take the risk of allowing someone to take and short your shares with out you knowing.

Seeing the ibkr reports throughout the entirety of the GME process absolutely blew my mind when seeing us burn through a million short shares a day and then another million would appear the next day and we'd do it again. 

We have the rights to our shares and our brokers shouldn't have the right to a ""borrow"" them with out our knowledge. We should have to Opt-in to this practice instead of having to jump through hoops to Opt-out

If GME management can rebrand as the sort of place where you can go to not only BUY games, but hang out with other gamers (think a back room for streaming, tournaments, some extra consoles or a PC setup).

How Change Happens: Thoughts on The House Committee on Financial Services hearing on $GME,146,ln26mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln26mg/how_change_happens_thoughts_on_the_house/,21,1613724241.0,"I hope all of you fellow degenerates are in good health and spirit.

Today we saw the House Committee on Financial services address the recent situation on $GME. I don't know about you guys, but for the first time in my life I was excited to watch our government (attempt to) do their job. I got on the subreddit and was met with a similar wave of enthusiasm and interest. But I also saw something else: Cynicism. There's a good chunk of us who don't really believe that congress will do their jobs. People went out of their way to point out conflicts of interest and even referred back to '08.

People are entitled to their own opinion, such is the WSB way. But I would like to express how much I disagree with the cynics and how hopeful I am with what has transpired in the financial markets, and the world these last few months.

**Individual** investors from all across the world shared research, data, their sentiments and theses with the world here on our forum. This community found the opportunity of a lifetime and we held on with conviction, and solidarity the likes of which I have never in my life seen before. We took on the giants of the financial world and made them taste blood. We exposed ***ONCE AGAIN*** the dangers of unregulated financial markets and the dangerous levels of leverage these sOpHiStIcAtEd iNvEsToRs use and justify. We exposed a systemic risk in the system and we caught the attention of media the world over.

Even still, with shills and bots flooding our home we held. With fear, uncertainty and doubt sweeping across investors all across the world we held. We cost the greedy billions and collectively along with our Institutional long allies made billions in the process. We shook the finance world to it's core.

Some truly savant level autists among us predicted the short squeezes, the gamma squeezes, the imminent collapse of the financial markets! A good chunk of these predictions were accurate. I'll link the original prediction posts here if I can find them, but in the meanwhile take a look at this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video).

That's right. We nearly collapsed the entire American financial system. All because we spotted the opportunity of a lifetime and held. At the end of the day you know what happened. This isn't a fairytale and we were screwed out of our ticket to the moon. Now before I continue with all this sentimental bullshit lets analyze today's hearing.

**The Hearing**

Today's hearing was definitely interesting. We saw some politicians give in and throw softball questions, but we also saw others grow a spine and start turning the screws. There was a lot of talk about new financial transaction taxes aiming to take down (scalpers) HFT's. We saw our representatives talk about decentralized finance, margin requirements, settlement times, the conflicts of interest certain firms had and the health and regulation of our financial markets.

Not everything was good though. Like stated earlier some politicians folded, and some were outright bribed with campaign contributions by Ken Griffin of Citadel and Vlad Tenev of RH. We saw a few fucks even talk about eliminating Dodd Frank regulations on margin. (For those of you younger autists those were the laws enacted directly following the '08 recession and aimed to limit risk in our markets).

Overall it's what you expect out of any large group of people, there were some upstanding individuals who did their duty and stood by their constituents, but there were also spineless kleptocrats who used their position and influence for gain.

I don't get the cynicism though. What did you fucks expect? Congress to issue a decree forcing these fuckers to buy back all GameStop shares at $1000 per? What matters most is that we brought attention to the underlying issues that plague our financial markets and institutions. The fight is long from over but we're making strides in the right direction.

Change doesn't happen in a day, not in a week or even a month. Hell when it comes to the change we seek; a truly free and fair financial market. It's likely going to take years, possibly decades to see the fruits of our labor.

BIG FUCKING PROPS to our boy u/deepfuckingvalue. Keith if you're reading this homie know that you're an inspiration to us all. You had a thesis and stuck with it. A truly humble and funny guy. Loved going back and watching your YouTube videos and watching you testify today was the highlight of my year. Best of luck to you bro, whatever you end up doing, you'll always be #1 here. If it was up to me I'd petition whatever religion authorities that give out sainthoods and lobby them to make you the ***Patron Saint of Retail Traders***. The movement you started finally started shedding light on the shady tactics used to screw the little guy. And we're all the little guy. Whether you have 8 figures or 8 dollars Wall Street will try to play you for a sucker. I'll cya on the moon homie.

**Other things to note/Vent about**

For all the annoying fucks who feel the need to antagonize GameStop investors, do the community a favor and shut the fuck up. It's our money and we can invest, gamble, make or lose it however we god damn please. No one gives a fuck that you think we're bagholders. We had the balls to risk our capital for gain, and losses are a risk we take. What especially pisses me off is the new people making snide remarks. If you weren't here pre GME you don't have the right to call us bagholders. The OGs of this sub know bagholders because we learned that shit the hard way holding puts while the economy was recovering or buying calls as it was tanking. We've played more earnings calls than you've even fucking listened to. I'm glad you fucks found this sub but try not to be insufferable.

Here at WSB our mouths water at the opportunity of high risk high reward plays. This community used to be smart people acting like retards. Now its a community of retards who think they're savants because they paperhanded at the right time or got lucky here and there. When someone makes it big we say congrats and fuck you. When someone loses big we laugh and tell them why they're retarded. If you don't add any value to the conversation in terms of data, opinion, sentiment or otherwise don't have anything clever or funny to say do us a favor and shut the fuck up.

Bit unrelated to the earlier stuff but stop sucking off Fidelity. They're the institutional investors that sold off their stake and tanked the share price. Retail stood strong. I get they're a good broker dealer and are leagues ahead of their competitors, by all means do business with them, but stop sucking them off 24/7 it's annoying.

Positions: $GME at cost basis of \~$27 per share. Sold on the way up to lock in some gains but still holding shares because I'd sooner see it fall back to $3 than to turn my back on my fellow degenerates.

PLTR's price action appears to be heavily influenced by shorts.

You can see that today (not pictured) that, when shorts covered 3 million shares at market open today, the price recovered momentarily (false bull signal). 

Today the shorts have entered a fresh 3 million shares short position at the share price of around $25 with borrow fees in the mid 60%, betting that insiders will dump.

$NRG will see a massive drop because of the Texas Winter Weather Crisis,25,ln11cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln11cq/nrg_will_see_a_massive_drop_because_of_the_texas/,58,1613721064.0,"As many of you know, Texas has been dealing with a massive energy crisis this week due to abnormal freezing temperatures that have caused massive dissarray to Texas energy grids.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before implementing rolling outages, ERCOT (the regulatory agency charged with managing the flow of electricity across Texas) was dealt with immense price surges as demand for electricity rose to a high of $5,000-7,000 per Megawatt/Hr. 

It is very likely that $NRG, one of the largest electricity providers in Texas, was forced to purchase electricity at these astronomical rates as most of their energy production was partially offline due to freezing temperatures. 

During normal times, NRG produces 23 GW (23000 Megawatts) of electricity for 3.7 million residents in Texas. However, due to the weather, many coal and natural gas generation plants across Texas owned by NRG were unable to operate due to the freezing temperatures (many plants were not allowed to operate as they lacked substantial weatherproofing)

Hence, one can assume that NRG bought electricity during peak prices prior to the rolling outages implemented by ERCOT at the beginning of the week. The only question is, **how much did they buy and were they able to hedge in time?**

Several indicators have suggested bearish movement within the stock as it fell around 11% as of Feb. 18 and is likely to continue on down until their earnings call in Feb. 25th. 

There was also an unusual amount of options activity in $NRG Puts as **11,659** individuals bought **March 19, 2021 $28 Puts.**

*TLDR; Electricity company buy overpriced electricity = Bad bad for short term company financials.*

I'd like to preface this by saying that I am an analyst, but a really shitty one, and not in finance.

**I bring to you: DOLLAR GENERAL**

Aside from the fact that it has exceeded earnings the last 4 quarters, there is a run up trend for at least the past three (Q3, Q2, Q1 2020) right before earnings with a dump immediately after. This falls in line with most earnings plays right now as well (see Disney clowns, Palantards, AMDeeznuts, bla bla). I don't have any astrology charts, I ate the crayons.

The company's financials seem solid and this seems like a recession-proof play that will either provide good tendies or food stamps (no Dollar General snackers here).

**Beer Case:**

Competition - Walmart, Costco... okay, cool. From what I know, I feel like Walmart and Dollar General are a different kind of shopping and Walmart is usually more inconvenient to get to than DG, usually on the outskirts of cities and in the suburbs (could be wrong). Costco is definitely a threat but requires memberships. Welcome to accept argument on this.

Boomer stock - Yes, I am aware. However, so is AT&T and tendies were made on that.

Market having gone full retard - I would say buyer beware but you retards are at a kindergarten reading level.

**Conclusion:**

Someone else wrote a DD on this before, but their positions are likely bust and I'm not sure why they didn't buy in for AFTER earnings.

**TLDR:**

May hit, IDK.

**Positions:**

I just casually trade on the occasion and like making money. I like this stock. I'm not asking for anyone to do anything. Just a discussion post seeing where people are.)

So as we all know, GME took a steep dive and today it dipped below $50. For me, my strategy was to buy in (as quickly as I could at the moment) and most likely sell at/ past 500. The only problem? It never hit 500. Hell, it sunk like a tank. I held on because I was watching the news and reading our fellow retards in the chat as we were all holding till we die.

Well, I'm almost dead. I put in about 7k into GME at 340, and boy, I only have about 800 as my position with a negative 6.2k.

Now, I know this isn't the end of the world as there are some big as retards who are down tens/ hundreds of thousands of dollars, but my question to you people is this -

WHEN DOES IT END? I need to know if we still have diamond hands or not. This is the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I have done a meme stock and now I'm down good portion after my hundreds of times winning in the market. Not a lot in the grand scheme, but still down a couple thousand to a normal ass human being is still being down. 

What are ya'lls thoughts? Where's your position? It seems there is a mix from the community but the only way we can be saved is if this goes up 1000% again. Reading the news and watching my position down past 80% is a punch in the dick (I hate losing but it's inevitable which is why I only put 7k in lol) and IDK if I should take my loss and move on and get my gains back on other good pops.

Mexico is even pressing the U.S. to guarantee natural gas supplies after power was interrupted earlier in the week.
What happened? The cold snap tested Texas's highly decentralized electricity model, where power plants don't have incentive to build reserve capacity, but are rather paid for the energy that they sell. A widespread electricity failure ensued due to freezing natural gas pipelines, as well solar and wind generation that went offline due to the weather.

Obligatory I'm not a financial advisor and am retarded.

Here is my bull thesis for this $AAWW (Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings):

1. **P/E ratio of 4.3:** This company is currently trading at a market cap of $1.56B, they posted a $3.2B revenue in 2020 with a $360M profit. That's right, it's trading at a market cap of 0.5x annual revenue, a PE ratio of 4.33 and a Price/EBIT ratio of 2. 
2. **24% YOY growth, cargo partner for Amazon:** $AAWW [is a contractor for Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/amazon-cargo-contractor-atlas-air-expects-more-growth-in-early-2021.html) and has seen its revenue grow by 24% in 2020. With the boom in e-commerce, the air cargo business has not suffered like the passenger air travel business and I expect it will continue to grow. It is rare for companies that are growing at this incredible rate to have such a low PE multiple.
3. **Decline in passenger air travel means airplanes available at a discount**

There's no way he could have been lucky enough to have exited his short positions the day before the spike. 

If he indeed exited his positions the day before, someone high up informed him this shit was coming and caused him to leave before the spike. 

Just a thought.. I know it probably isn't technically considered insider trading, but there has to be some sort of law against that sort of inside information, right?

Edit: he said days before the spike, not day. My bad. My point still stands valid, though.
I'm talking about what he said on stream earlier, not any speculation or other bullshit. He literally said under oath that he exited his short positions just days before the spike. 

Edit: Buy $GME! I'm too broke and retarded to be sued, so IDGAF about telling people I'm not a financial advisor. Buy $GME because it's a great stock, not because I told you to buy $GME. Stonks only go up.

Last edit: forgot positions pls no ban. I'm not holding any options because I'm too poor but I hold 40 GME @ $36 and 1 tesla @ $834.

Final final edit: I'm aware this isn't actually insider trading by definition. However if he actually had someone from one of the clearinghouses giving him information that isn't privy to the public, that's shady as fuck and should be considered insider trading. This is speculation of course but it's suspicious as fuck for him to claim he closed his positions only days prior to the massive spike past $100.

No this is not the same as some average Joe pulling out right before the spike. He has infinitely more power over things than retail investors do, and that's what makes it suspicious as fuck.

* **Despite the severe foundry shortage, Himax has secured a greater supply for Q1 2021 and onwards. This is in comparison to the peak levels of demand, seen in Q4 2020, and the foundry supply is expected to growth every quarter afterwards. A meaningful capacity has been delegated to automobiles... which is also an extremely profitable sector for $HIMX.**

**2. Customer List by Product**

I took this off a presentation deck for investors (February 2021), so this is pretty recent:

**3.** **Product Categories**

I've gone ahead and created two tables below, detailing the segments Himax offers, as well as the Q1 2021 guidance on each segments. This is a good way to understand what Himax sells and why they are a good investment, even for the long-term.

CRSR - Corsair Gaming DD and why it's undervalued,216,lmutpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmutpf/crsr_corsair_gaming_dd_and_why_its_undervalued/,92,1613704971.0,"Position: 315@36 no financial advise

CRSR is one of the few stocks that is actually fundamentally undervalued in this FED fueled printer market. Let's take a look at the P/S Ratio of some of your favorite stocks and Corsairs. 

[P/S Ratio List](https://imgur.com/a/kTvFTZ1) Price to Sale Ration / Market Cap to Revenue Ratio

I've listed the P/S Ratio and y/y growth from AMZN, AAPL, AMD, PLTR, LOGI and CRSR. You can see that CRSR is trading at a P/S Ratio of just 2.1 and that while having the highest y/y revenue growth of all listed stocks. Not only that but their last quarter had a y/y growth revenue growth of over [70%](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) and earnings 152% growth. 2020 Revenue even already beating analysts prediction for 2021 sales of $1.72 billion. Basically any tech stock is trading at P/S Ratios of 5 or higher, giving Corsair a 200% upside. 

Andy Paul CEO of Corsair in the Q4 ER:  ""It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time.  Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future.""

Growth problem: What is stopping Corsair from further growth? It isn't demand. Corsairs sales could have been even greater if not for the semiconductor and general shortage. Many of Corsair products are sold out and production is being ramped up as fast as possible. Stopping their growth is the rate at which they can ramp up production. [Good news on that end](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order).

""At the moment, the company is more worried about the shortage of semiconductor components. It persisted throughout the fourth quarter,  the company could have raised even more funds if not for such restrictions. 

Streaming peripherals are also in high demand. Corsair said YouTube offered at least 40 million game channels in December. This makes the company’s management believe that streaming activity will soon be as widespread as gaming.""

Analyst Rod Hall continues to see Corsair as ""a high quality participant  in secular video gaming and eSports growth with a strong brand position and diversified product lineup.""

Contrary to some of the newly IPOed hype and meme stocks Corsair is actually operating at a profit, barely. They are basically growing the company as fast as possible without going billions into debt. They managed over 70% y/y growth for their 4th quarter while not opertaing at a loss. This is some good management.

So where is the catch? Why is the stock down? Well there are two bad news I could find.

First the [acquisition of Visuals by Impulse](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285508/corsair-elgato-visuals-by-impulse-acquisition-streaming-twitch) for an undisclosed amount. There is always some uncertainty with acquisitions especially when the paid amount is not stated, leading to concerns that it might have been a bad deal but this is a short term fear and the acquisition will help to reinforce the Elgato ecosystem:

 “With the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family, we’re  excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators.  Design is a crucial element shaping a creator’s identity, and VBI has  been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design  accessible to anyone,” wrote Julian Fest, SVP and general manager at  Elgato, in a press release. “Together with the talented team at VBI, we  plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators.” 

Second the Wallstreet analysts fear that ""people will stop gaming when the pandemic ends"". Decide for youself how you feel about this. I don't see how demand will substantially lessen in the next 12-15 months for current gen consoles, graphics cards and cpus and at that point next generation products will be ready. If you look at the [current steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam) barely 1.2% of people are using 3000 series graphics cards with only 11% of people using 2000 series gpus. Over 80% of active steam users are running systems with 2 or more generations old hardware and are potentially looking to upgrade their systems. Addtionally the entry age for gaming is getting lower and lower. More kids want to play video games and need the hardware to do so. Corsair provides All-In-One Systems, System Cases, full range Power supplies, full range cooling solutions, full range of peripherals, market leading streaming equipment, SSDs and RAM. Basically anything you will need with a pc but the CPU, GPU and motherboard.

The tech demand is not a Corsair only problem though, it is a problem for most tech stocks yet their P/S Ratios are still much higher. These ""out of tech"" rotations were already happening in summer last year because all the so smart Wallstreet analysts thought that ""nobody would buy tech anymore"" since a ""vaccine was near"". 8 months later there is no sign of any demand decline. These analyst try to be smart and predict the demand rotations, truth is TECH IS THE FUTURE. TECH WILL PREVAIL if old smelly men on Wallstreet acknowledge it or not, it doesn't change the inevitable.

Demand growth will decrease eventually but demand will very likely stay at these high levels and lead Corsair to constant further growth. Their prediction for 2021 revenue growth is at a conservative \~15% which will very likely be exceeded. Even with these conservative predictions the current P/S Ratio is a joke and the stock massively undervalued.

[Amateur TA](https://imgur.com/a/bD14NJn) just drew some lines, look somewhere else for a propper one.

Opinion: Maybe the stock will follow its upwards trend in the triangle but I think the stock is basically just waiting for any catalyst to break out. This is probably the last chance to get this under 40$. With a personal predictions of >20% revenue growth for 2021 and the rise of the P/S Ration to a conservative level of 4, the market cap should come to about 8B or an undiluted upside of 220% or 85$ a share.

The stock is experiencing relatively high volatility right now. Stocks or LEAPS are the safer option.

This small movement shows that we are tired of being pushed around, this movement shows that when we want fucking change we can push for change. This movement was hard, there was a lot going on and we were going up against a lot of money with broken rules in a fraudulent system. 

This has sent waves to other groups, for example. I am a medical student who is pursing a DO degree which has been declared on par with an MD (look it up if you want to get into the weeds but we take the same classes and standardized tests to practice along side MD's). Anyways, recently due to corona one of the exam (Step ii CS) was cancelled for MD's only. The DO's still had to pay for this exam, fly to the location, and take it. The subreddit r/medicalschool fought to call out the AACOMAS (the group responsible for DO's). With everyone at the medical subreddit seeing what you guys did here caused them to push and get the test cancelled recently. 

I put 10k and have lost 8k, but this is a lesson for me that and a middle finger to the rest of our country that we are tired of being pushed around by boomers who are getting comfortable in their high up positions.

I’ve been seeing some reports that 100s of millions of GME haven’t been covered yet. The Melvin Capital guy just (“under oath”) stated that prior to buying restrictions placed on GME by brokers, they had exited all their positions. However, I wasn’t convinced with that because the price kept going up for a bit (someone correct me if I’m wrong please). While seeing a lot of positive DD about this whole situation is good, you have to admit that it’s a little worrying when there’s not even a bear DD on this case. 

I’ve seen some due diligence on here and as good as been good and reassuring to read, I’m someone who likes to be realistic with everything including what’s happening with GME. I would like to do my own due diligence and find out what’s happening through my own research and have decided to start here by getting the perspective of those who have done their own DD. 

PS: Question to those who are up to date with the GME numbers: Say if it’s true that Melvin exited all their positions, can it be argued that these $350 million of uncovered worth of shares were placed when GME hit $450+ highs and that these positions will then be covered when shorts have driven the share price to a low price (this would make sense because buying of GME was restricted) . If true that would mean those who are still holding are just bag holders right?

"FYI for people new to the VIX and VIX ETFs, before you go balls deep.",99,lmt5s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmt5s0/fyi_for_people_new_to_the_vix_and_vix_etfs_before/,58,1613700824.0,"Hello retards. Last week I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaxu1/600m_in_inflows_to_uvxy_in_the_past_4_days_is/) regarding a Bloomberg article indicating that there was a large inflow into the UVXY ETF to discuss what it means for the market. The general gist of the discussion was that either a lot of traders were buying UVXY to hedge an expected correction or that hedge funds were borrowing shares to short, indicating an expectation of calm waters on the horizon. Bloomberg assumed that latter last week but has since [changed its mind](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/reddit-is-chief-suspect-as-volatility-etf-swells-to-2-6-billion), postulating that it was WSB.

While I still don't know what the volume means, I did see a lot of comments on the post that indicated that a shocking number of you people know absolutely nothing about the VIX or the VIX ETFs many of you are YOLOing. Some of the misconceptions I saw included ""lol okay gay bear"" and ""I just bought 3000 shares, looks like this is the bottom"". Both of these comments imply that you people have no idea what UVXY is and are going to lose a bunch of money if it is in fact the retail investor driving its inflows.

First of all, the large inflows into UVXY, as I have said multiple times, do not mean people are betting on the market to fall. It could mean the opposite as it could mean hedge funds are borrowing shares to sell short and are therefore betting on the ETF to drop due to further volatility decrease.

Another thing is that the price of UVXY and VXX is not inherently bearish for a number of reasons. The first being that UVXY doesn't literally track the VIX and follow the price up or down like SPY or QQQ. UVXY is not comprised of stocks like an index fund. It is comprised of futures positions with an average maturity of 1 month and is 1.5x leveraged. Futures positions are similar to options in that they are a degrading asset. If the futures contracts bought by this fund expire below the price they were bought at, the fund realizes those losses and is then buying futures positions with a smaller money pool. Exposure in these funds is reset daily, which means that it is on autopilot buying and selling futures contracts with undeployed funds each day to maintain an average 30 day maturity leveraged 1.5x.

This means that trying to apply any type of technical analysis, chart pattern analysis, etc. to UVXY is fucking worthless. The fund does not have support or resistance levels and this is not a long-term hold. Funds like this constantly do reverse splits to bring share price and options price back to more tradeable levels. For those of you who are newer to the market, there was once a 2x leveraged VIX fund called TVIX that shut down because it ran out of money. I also want to make something very clear since there's speculation that hedge funds are buying UVXY to short. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GME and AMC. You cannot short squeeze UVXY. ETFs are different from stocks in that market makers can issue new shares to meet demand. The feedback loop that caused the gamma squeeze in GME would not be possible unless the issuer of the ETF halted creation of new shares. It is entirely possible to lose every penny you put into UVXY if you hold indefinitely. 

The fund also doesn't necessarily rise and fall with the VIX. Over the summer, VXX and UVXY fell as the VIX went up on a pretty consistent basis. This was when Softbank was buying a bunch of calls and driving up options premiums. Even though the VIX was going up, VIX futures did not do so because there was not a strong expectation that the VIX was going to spike over the course of the following months. The fund makes money due to sharp volatility increases such as during a correction, when the underlying VIX increases 10%+ on a single day. The fund does not make money when there is sustained, relatively high volatility. You can [go here](https://www.proshares.com/funds/uvxy_daily_holdings.html) to look at what contracts UVXY is currently holding. Currently, it has March and April contracts in a proportion that exposes it to an average 1-month maturity.

If you do want to buy this fund based on historic VIX support and resistance levels and a bet that a correction is coming soon, you need to look at the actual VIX, which cannot itself be traded. Currently, the real VIX is at 23.76, at around the area it was at the end of February 2020 before the market crash. At that time, UVXY was at about $15.00 per share. Right now UVXY is near all time lows, but the VIX itself is still elevated relative to historical standards. In October 2017, the VIX went as low as 9, less than half of current levels, and the price of UVXY was still around $15.00 per share. If you think the VIX is irrationally at a historical bottom, you're wrong. It is near the bottom of a range it has been fluctuating between for the last 6-9 months, which is roughly 20-40.

In order to understand the supports and resistances of the VIX you need to understand what comprises the VIX.  The VIX ""measures fear and uncertainty"" by aggregating the premium people are paying for OTM options on S&P500 stocks. The idea is that demand, and therefore price, for OTM options contracts goes up if people are hedging more in either direction. This is how the VIX went up during a bull run over the summer. The market, especially retail investors, were willing to pay more for options premiums and demand was especially high due in part to SoftBank's aggressive call buying. The VIX also spikes during corrections because the demand for puts goes up. People don't know how deeply they have to hedge during a correction and will pay up for puts way OTM. That's why VIX spikes are generally, but not necessarily, considered bearish.

So the best way you can use the VIX isn't necessarily by buying into VIX ETFs like UVXY. Instead, one might want to use it as an indicator for buying or selling SPY. For example, since the VIX is near a support level right now, one might bet on it bouncing off that support in a broad selloff or breaking through that support as the economy continues to recover. You can also look at the VVIX, the derivative of the VIX, to get an idea of how fast options premiums are changing at a given time. VVIX will rally as options premiums go up or down and generally indicates that people are repositioning. A peak in VVIX indicates that repositioning is done and can precede the last leg of a trend. VVIX will go down as people hold their positions and wait for things to play out.

Edit (2/19) - TLDR:

1. VIX ETFs are not the same as the VIX. You cannot buy the VIX. ETFs track VIX futures and are not a diamond hands play - you can lose every penny (see TVIX). Look at the real VIX to determine entry/exit points.


2. Now isn't a horrible time to play UVXY or another VIX ETF. The actual VIX is [near the bottom](http://imgur.com/gallery/85Ys3WH) of its recent trading range and looks to be close to an inflection point. 


3. The VVIX, VIX's derivative and retarded cousin, just saw a big spike but [looks to have peaked](https://imgur.com/gallery/vucgyLm) based on the past 2 days. If VVIX goes down again today (2/19) a big VIX move will probably wait until VVIX bottoms. VVIX essentially measures the speed at which options premiums are changing and spikes as the market repositions. 


4. The VIX can be a useful tool.  If you want to learn some tricks on how to use/interpret/understand the VIX, read the text wall above.


5. There is evidence UVXY is being heavily shorted right now, which is interesting, but UVXY is not vulnerable to a short squeeze and the VIX cannot be directly manipulated.",2021-02-19 04:13:44

Sonos and Microsoft Partnership (DD) - Easter Eggs Found,40,lmsz56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmsz56/sonos_and_microsoft_partnership_dd_easter_eggs/,20,1613700403.0," **Just sharin' my thoughts and posting some good ole' fashioned WSB due diligence.**

Microsoft has a [habit of adding easter eggs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287007/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-hidden-easter-egg-commercial-launch-trailer) — new products or clues to announcements yet to be released -- in its videos, whether it’s the new Xbox Wireless headset or the Xbox Series S.

Sonos introduced a new color for their Sonos Move speaker — Sonos calls it “lunar white,” and it was launched in June of 2020 — right before the Series S was announced.  It’s marketed by Sonos as “a lighter color to complement your home and the rest of your system.”

[https://blog.sonos.com/en/move-lunar-white/](https://blog.sonos.com/en/move-lunar-white/)

The **lunar** white (official color) Move should compliment your **robot** white (official color) Xbox Series S and your new robot white Xbox Series Controller... think they like lunar robots?

You can start to see Sonos and Microsoft products together in a video on Xbox's official Youtube channel (October 30, 2020) -- I can't link directly to Youtube in this post or the automoderator will banish it to the shadow realm.

Screenshots from video:

Notice that the Sonos speakers get shuffled around between takes.  In one frame the speakers are sitting on a sofa table -- in another shot the speakers are positioned on stands (another Sonos product).  There's a deliberate effort to get the speakers into the shot.  

Speakers aside, here's a very carefully/purposefully framed shot pairing the Xbox Series S' white controller and a Sonos sub:

[https://imgur.com/XdiX7H8](https://imgur.com/XdiX7H8)

Keep in mind — the focus of this video is generic (“You’re the future of gaming”) — yet several frames focus on the (white) Series S and not the Series X, all the while white Sonos speakers appear in the background of several shots.

\*\*\*

Last note on colors — it might be worth stating the obvious that the two available colors for all of Sonos products match perfectly with the Series S (“robot white”) or Series X (“carbon black”). Put up a Sonos Arc next to a Series X and you’ll see they’re an exact match... or just look at this screenshot from a video posted by Panos Panay (Microsoft Chief Product Officer):

[https://imgur.com/xlOW6wI](https://imgur.com/xlOW6wI)

That screenshot came from a 6-second video -- published less than 2 weeks after that official Xbox video with the same controller closeup (matching controller + Xbox + Sonos product).

**That is not a coincidence.  Know what else isn't a coincidence?  Panos Panay was added to the Board of Directors for Sonos in August of 2020:**

Last little nugget... if you visit [sonos.xbox.com](https://sonos.xbox.com/) you'll see that the subdomain exists (and according to an online tool I used it shows registered late in 2019 -- can't 100% verify). As of  (or for now)  if you visit the subdomain it redirects to a generic support page that discusses Groove Music shutting down.  Groove Music was Xbox's old music service, shuttered years ago.

The subdomain hasn't been used for anything... yet:  [https://web.archive.org/web/\*/sonos.xbox.com](https://web.archive.org/web/*/sonos.xbox.com)

So what's coming?

**PREDICTION #1:**

Sonos has its first investor's day coming up early next month and I think Sonos will announce a partnership with Microsoft -- I think Sonos Radio will become the official (ie integrated) music service of Xbox. Use your headphones or Sonos speakers. Great for both companies.

**PREDICTION #2:**

Sonos Radio (HD) -- Sonos' premium monthly service -- will become a perk available in an upper-tier of Game Pass.

**PREDICTION #3:**

I also think that Sonos will announce its new headphones, which look like a carbon copy (ie, they shared a lot of the same production process) of Microsoft's new wireless headset. The only difference is that the Sonos headphones will presumably be a bit more stylish and something you would wear out of the house -- it also appears they'll have an integrated mic:

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office)[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset)

I think the Sonos headphones will act as the ""premium"" set of headphones (and cost $250-$350) and Microsoft will retain the entry level at $99. Sonos products are already sold through the Xbox and in Microsoft's Store, so they'll just join the rest of the products.

**PREDICTION #4 (BONUS!):**

Sonos already has a partnership with Disney -- Disney announced a few months ago that they will be ending Radio Disney. I don't listen to the station, you don't listen to the station, but according to the most recent numbers I found 30 million a week listen to it. It may not be worth it for Disney to keep it going, but that would be HUGE for Sonos' ecosystem.

Radio Disney is already alive and well in Sonos today... you have to buy a Sonos product to listen to it, of course. Coincidentally, Sonos also just announced last month that they are committed to creating new, exclusive content for their radio HD service. In fact, they have a new recording studio built just for broadcasting new music.

\*\*\*

I love Sonos as a company -- I also like the stock. I don't think Sonos is going to underwhelm with their first investor's day and announce a product and that'll be it. I think we'll see some of the predictions I outlined above come to fruition.

The pure cannabis etf has GTI, Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco, TerrAscend, AYR, Jushi, Innovative Industrial Property, GrowGen, and Columbia Care. These firms make up over 70 % of the ETF and will soon include Verano which just went public. The ETF is going to explode when the US gov uplists these firms to the NYSE and make them available on apps like robinhood (fuck them but people use it). 

The up list is a critical catalyst for the US because it will give access to many investors that want cannabis stocks for us markets. we are talking multiple times potential increase in demand for the shares. 

we just saw sec filings from GTI and trulieve see below. 

The potential for a US uplist could come as early as spring 2021 and the latest i expect is the early winter of 2022. 
The US cannabis industry is larger and more profitable than Canada and far more established than Europe. it is where smart money is investing

 I'm long calls for 60c 3/19 63c 3/19 and 75c 78c 80c 1/21/22

Palantir and Akin Gump Sign Deal to Launch Legal Digital Services Platform,339,lmruzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmruzp/palantir_and_akin_gump_sign_deal_to_launch_legal/,105,1613697519.0,"Many of you have likely seen this deal already, **but let me explain this to you from the perspective of a corporate lawyer who works at a peer firm of Akin Gump/in a big law firm and why it's huge.**

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210218005215/en/Palantir-and-Akin-Gump-Collaborate-on-Legal-Digital-Service-Platform](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210218005215/en/Palantir-and-Akin-Gump-Collaborate-on-Legal-Digital-Service-Platform)

In the world of corporate law, **""big law"" firms run the scene**. They are the ones responsible for nearly every single SPAC deal, merger, etc. that you read about on the financial news. Arguably, about 100 of these ""big law"" firms run the corporate scene in America, with other scattered mid-size firms working on big deals here and there.

One of the biggest stressors in dealing with big law firms is **billing rates.** In the world of big law, we bill clients every 1/10th of an hour (every 6 minutes). Firms like K&E bill at a **rate of $1,845 per hour** (by partner), with associates billing at rates like **$400-$800+ per hour**. Chat on the phone with a partner for 30 minutes about a line in a contract you're about to sign? Hello $900 charge.

[https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/30/will-billing-rates-for-elite-firms-rise-more-in-2020/#:\~:text=Now%2C%20both%20Kirkland%20partner%20and,%241%2C165%E2%80%94a%203.6%25%20increase](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/30/will-billing-rates-for-elite-firms-rise-more-in-2020/#:~:text=Now%2C%20both%20Kirkland%20partner%20and,%241%2C165%E2%80%94a%203.6%25%20increase).

 Form documents (think along the lines of 100-page merger agmnt) are worked on by corporate lawyers for hours on end, which is why you see people, like me, billing absurd hours at absurd rates. Doing basic DD, document review, contract editing, and more, will all earn clients huge bills for seemingly menial tasks. **Big law firms have been trying to find a way to outsource work that their clients increasingly don't want to pay for.** Law firms are outsourcing to India to conduct document review. Lawyers and businesses alike have been trying to solve this issue for years. [https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/06/elite-law-firms-are-quietly-outsourcing-high-value-functions-how-far-will-they-go/](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/06/elite-law-firms-are-quietly-outsourcing-high-value-functions-how-far-will-they-go/).

**Akin Gump's ""RegSpot"" launch is likely made in response to these billing pressures.** It's not quite clear what kind of work in particular this is aiming to accomplish, but it's meant to deal with things like due diligence, conflict checks, other legal work at increasingly high speed/a short amount of time. Time is everything in corporate law, and Palantir's Foundry is here to tackle it. Foundry is literally taking on the entire essence of big law billing by offering a solution to get the work done faster. Endless value add to clients. If other big law firms follow suit and this becomes an industry norm, I don't even know what the limit is. I can see peer firms subscribing to Foundry because firms that don't use it will be stuck billing clients with vast amounts of hours.

This can literally revolutionize the legal industry and disrupt billing norms as we see it. Maybe Palantir will fuck my job. That's fine, because PLTR TO THE MOON.

tl;dr: PLTR's deal with Akin is absolutely huge. Has potential to disrupt longstanding billing pressures in the legal industry.

Not financial advice, I'm just a guy who likes stocks and has a little background in financial analysis and mortgage servicing data tech. What you do with your money is your choice. 

Posted this right out of my analysis notes. Let me know if there's any formatting issues and I'll try to fix it. Not that most of you can read anyway.

# Current Holdings

No large positions, recently bought in during dip, wish I had bought way more calls yesterday, they've already increase by +30%.

50 Shares BKI @ \~$81 average

2x BKI 04/16/2021 90.00 C @ .90 

# Summary

* Analyst valuation likely based on Discounted Free Cash Flow (FCF) pricing models. See discounted cash flow section below for details
* Growth in FCF slowed in 2020 due to acquisitions, Available equity to shareholders reduced due to leveraged acquisition
* 10 year note yields increased this week and 5 year moving average SP500 returns are above historical averages
* Discounted FCF valuation will be lowered given all above factors
* My point of view, BKI will see increased FCF in near future and SP500 returns will regress to mean - indicating higher price target in near future
* Current analyst consensus: 95−100 / share
* My price target: approx 150 per share EoY

## Positives

*See sources and notes section for reference*

* Very near term: Growth in Origination, Data and Analytics to existing customers
   * 2020 GAAP Diluted EPS is expected to be $1.73 (Currently approx 1.5)
   * DnB have reported 10Million additional Free Cash Flow
* 7% sustained growth target seems achievable given historical trends and increase in under performant loans
   * Current Discounted Cash Flow Models seem to point at 5% sustained grow market consensus @ 82/share, 15 Billion Enterprise Value
   * If 6% sustained growth is better demonstrated and extends to free cash flows, 2021 price target: $154 / share, 26 Billion Enterprise Value
* Digital Servicing product includes: 64% Market share for MSP loans
   * Wave of under-performant / non-performant loans increases MSP held loans
   * Under performant loans need loss-mitigation: only 33% MSP loans currently use loss mitigation from BKI
   * Enhancing bulk data product offerings with SSIS packages vs traditional file dumps
* AIVS AI Origination service gaining traction in difficult to penetrate top 50 lenders
* Lower originations longer term drive need to for cost efficiency and/or more deferment of mortgage servicing activity
* From 4Q earning call: 2021 GAAP adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of 2.11𝑡𝑜2.11to2.22 (Currently \~1.5)

## Risks

* Debt: Recent leveraged acquisitions increased Interest Expense and Asset to Liability (See Charts)
* Dunn & Bradstreet: Significant proportion (\~20.5%) of Assets are due to DNB investment
* Small MSPs historically reluctant to provide analytics services
* Large originators have EnCompass as preferred origination services provider, difficult to onboard new clients in this space
* Leadership has shown willingness to sell additional shares for future acquisitions, diluting current share price if acquisition is viewed unfavorably

### Percent DnB of assets

Large percentage of book assets are DnB shares: Percent DnB of Total Assets: 20.55  

## Free Cash Flow over time

Growth in FCF has stagnated. Likely due to mortgage payment deferrals and acquisitions. 

https://preview.redd.it/nlpml4h9n9i61.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=902ca4a945a46a5e7f26e822f0adbc4fcd3ae872

 Compare Free Cash Flows of other businesses with similar acquisition models. CRM and SAP price are not bound to free cash flows, unlike BKI seemingly is.

**Geopolitical backdrop 🇺🇸🇨🇳**

U.S.-China relations have soured since the Trump administration launched the trade war in 2018.  The Biden administration [has said](https://www.axios.com/biden-holds-first-call-as-president-with-chinas-xi-jinping-24fc24a6-0589-4e62-a5f5-b560eb29973f.html) that it will evaluate the Trump tariffs as a “baseline” and decide what to do next.  But more critically, Biden recently [called](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/17/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-freedom-of-navigation-intl-hnk/index.html) China America’s “most serious competitor,” and he is doubling down on a strong military/naval posture in China’s backyard.  China is pissed.

**Economics 🪨⛏**

The term ""[rare earths](https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/what-are-rare-earth-elements-and-why-are-they-important)"" covers 17 metallic elements you don’t remember from high-school Chemistry class.  Crap like: Lanthanum, Cerium, and Praseodymium.  Why do they matter?  Rare earths are vital components for personal electronics and military hardware.  Big Tech needs them for your smartphone display screens, and the Pentagon needs them for guided missiles, fighter jets, and submarines.

But here is the rub: China [controls](https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/10/chinas-monopoly-on-rare-earth-elements-and-why-we-should-care/) about 80% of the market for rare earths.  The “Made in China 2025” plan from President Xi Jinping seeks full vertical integration of the rare-earth industry—from mining to refining to production of electronic goods.  And guess what China does NOT want?  More U.S. guided missiles, fighter jets, and submarines deployed to the South China Sea.  On Feb. 16, Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/d3ed83f4-19bc-4d16-b510-415749c032c1) that the Chinese government may curb Chinese exports of rare earths to “hobble” the U.S. defense industry. A Chinese draft bill [says](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/17/business/china-rare-earths/) that the Chinese government will manage the process from mining to exports of rare earths as a national strategy,

Enter [Lynas Corporation](https://www.lynascorp.com/) ([LYSCF](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LYSCF:OTCMKTS)).  Lynas is an Australian rare-earths mining company, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, and headquartered in Malaysia.  It is one of the only non-Chinese miners of rare earths.  It is not a perfect fix for the global economy; Lynas can only refine “light” rare earth elements and still relies on Chinese refining plants for “heavy” rare earths.  But this shortcoming is so concerning for the United States and EU that the Pentagon has invested in Lynas to bolster their “heavy” rare earth capacity.

**Trade War 💹🪖**

Chinese governance and media is tightly controlled, so the fact that FT reported on internal Chinese ministry debates to “hobble” the U.S. defense industry implied they leaked the conversations on purpose.  I’d surmise that they did so as a tactic for leverage in the U.S.-China trade war, in which the Biden administration is still evaluating all the Trump-era tariffs on China.  That is, Xi is thinking, ""drop the tariffs and we won't restrict rare earth exports.""

Regardless, China’s move is going to send jitters for electronics manufacturers, and China has [DONE THIS BEFORE](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/global/29rare.html).  Announced in 2010, China imposed export restrictions on rare earths, causing shockwaves to foreign companies and the global economy.  The result for [Lynas](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LYSCF:OTCMKTS) was a 500% increase in its stock from 2010–2011.  The United States, Japan, and the EU [sued](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds431_e.htm) China in the WTO to stop the export quotas.

**Conclusion**

If the Chinese government carries out its rare-earths export threat, Lynas will be sitting pretty and benefit from the high prices of rare-earths as the major non-Chinese supplier.  If China does not follow through on its threat, the threat itself will still leave manufacturers and traders with uncertainty, likely bolstering Lynas’ position in the market.  LYSCF is an Over-the-Counter (OTC) Equity Securities, so it’s not available to some traders on Robinhood (good riddance), and there’s a $7 fee to purchase on brokers like E\*TRADE.  Still, LYSCF seems like a solid move right now—if you can get your hands on it.

Volkswagen is still down from it's all-time high price of 2020, and the stock has fallen behind some of the other ones.

As of this posting, not an edit, , $SQ is down for the moment and looking real juicy to me.

4 months ago, I posted to the group that $SQ would post more than $1B in revenue from their low margin Cash app alternative asset feature. Wall Street rewards them despite the less than stellar EBITDA because the feature is very enticing as a customer acquisition tool, and it also very sticky for retaining customers. This time around, I expect $SQ to report over $4B in revenue from a single Cash app feature. 

Meanwhile, they are exploding in Oceania and the UK!. Their B2B play is poised to post huge gains on the heels of re-openings all over the US SMBs, and new businesses in particular, overwhelmingly prefer $SQ's vertically integrated merchant services like POS.  The tax business that they purchased from Credit Karma was a steal and worth much more. I expect absolutely monster earnings and huge gains from the company with one of the healthiest balance sheets out of the global pandemic. Is there a better stock on a major exchange?

I am LONG on BB and had been for a long time even before it went from $7-8 to 25+ and back.

I sold my holdings on the way up at $20 and entered back on the way down at $19/$18. For the past few weeks, I have been having that sinking feeling as the WSB driven hype over GME, NOK, AMC and BB wears off.

 So, here is where we stand:

* BB is a fundamentally strong tech company that has transformed from devices to software and security. They no longer make *any* phones. They sold all of their phone patents to Huawai.  

* Their QNX Operating System (OS) is in more than 175 million cars. 19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX.
* They are an under-valued tech company. [Zacks just upgraded BB. Price Target $29](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrlmd/zacks_just_upgraded_bb_price_target_29/)
* DD [Post about their products](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) \- QNX, QNX OS, Hypervisor, UEM, UES, Blackberry Spark

I am pragmatic and will not call for a $$ $$ but continue to be LONG with a target of $22-$25 by the end of the year. If that happens, **it would be a 30-40% gain in a year.** Not bad for a retail investor… Worth remembering that BB may NOT be a 🚀 🚀 🚀 story!",2021-02-19 01:41:39

With AMD only hovering at 100B i think it is SEVERELY undervalued

INTEL is double at 235B and Nvidia is triple at 350B

Positives: As the only chipmaker with the ability to produce x86 cpus and gpus, this has allowed AMD to create custom integrated solutions that has given them complete dominance over the console market. 

Xbox one, ps4, xbox series x, ps5, xbox one x

All this shit cant even stay on shelves.

Dont even get me started on oems

https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years

Amd surpassed intel for the first time in 15 years 


They are attacking nvidia and intel from both sides by providing much more consumer value.

Lets remember intel charges you extra for an overclockable chip and ram which is complete bullshit. 

With AMDs purchase of Xilinx it does dilute the stock however it only furthers AMD penetration in to the server market which intel has been heavily losing ground and thats where the big money is at.

Risks: China is the number one producer of silicon and is a one of the biggest risks as tensions between the US and china is growing fast over the uighurs situation. This is the biggest risk I see but i also don’t know if china is willing to shoot themselves in the foot by fucking over their silicon business

Unity is a software developer, and about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech. It took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it's been slowly bleeding as the market has remained down.
 
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, Cathie Woods has been steady in her support. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th (at around $130/share). Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128, and now 116. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity. I fully expect it to return to at least 130 in a couple of weeks.

Why stonks can only go up from here. An economic reason. Bears read this and you will get it.,83,lmonx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmonx7/why_stonks_can_only_go_up_from_here_an_economic/,94,1613689296.0,"The market will continue to go up despite every indicator that the market should go down. 

Primer: The fed uses monetary policy to control the flow of money in the system. When they want to restrict money (lower inflation) they increase interest rates and increase banks reserve limits (saying banks must keep a certain amount of cash on hand so dont loan out as freely). 

In 08 the fix to the recession was to open the flood gates. We printed new money, lowered reserve requirements and lowered interest rates. 

We never recovered from it (interest rates were at 4-5% and are now at 2%.) The ideal would have been increased spending to increase inflation and over time interest rates would have risen. 

The problem here is in 2010 when lending started up again people were buying houses at depressed prices from their 08 inflated prices. They could exactly raise rates on the people buying the homes in 2010 because that would put them upside down on their homes (interest rate goes up home value goes down). 

Fast forward 2020 enter pandemic. Interest rates were already low and now the fed had to lower them more so banks could lend more to: people, companies, etc. That however wasn't good enough to move the needle they needed to basically create an artificial inflation (stemchecks) so the whole thing wouldn't seize up (think last Feb). So, the Fed saved us. 

Now, if they raise the interest rate there will be a broad market sell off, recent home buyers could be upside down on their loans and the economy isnt anywhere near ready to come roaring back. It would kill the economy. 

Rates HAVE TO GO UP (google Japan early 90s real estate). Yellen knows this Powell knows this. The only way to offset the market selloff then is with a UBI which will inadvertently dump back into stocks in earnings or investments. This is the catalyst for home prices to increase. 

Home prices will increase because a UBI will cause a rent seeking problem. Rent will go up and the price of housing will go up equal to the amount of rent. 

So when home values get to high banks lose their primary money making product and will revert back to equities (stocks) which will continue to push markets higher. 

Basically the market will continue to climb because if it falters at this point it will trigger a much larger collapse and the fed and treasury are no longer equipped to deal with a crash. Thus it is in everyone's best interest to keep the markets up. 

1) interest rates low
2) interest rates lower
3) cant increase interest rates without a crash
4) create artificial inflation via UBI
5) housing prices spike, interest rates begin to go up (propped by UBI)
6) people are priced out of buying homes, banks pour money into markets. 

Stocks only go up.",2021-02-19 01:01:36

Be that as it may, I'm also a non-practicing lawyer who saw the Iovin class action against DFV and can't help but pipe in and say this, my far younger friends, is yet another reason to hate boomers. Disclosure: I'm not a boomer and I'm not giving legal advice.

Look at this crap from the complaint:

“60. Unaware of Gill’s deceitful social media communications, Plaintiff used approximately $200,000 in collateral to sell call option contracts for GameStop shares when the stock was below $100.”

Yes - the plaintiff (plaintiff means person suing) just thought he'd offer $100 contracts against a stock that was trading at $4 and had traded about that level for ages. Get real. This guy was hoping to schtup you, to take your money. 

Think about it like this - if you lived in a house - a little bungalow - and it's value hadn't changed much in years from about $100,000. Then all the sudden somebody said they'd buy it from you at whatever price you were willing to sell if that person was willing to pay them $2.5 million. Do you think the person selling that option didn't think something was fishy? Was he hoping to take your money and run knowing the price of that house, to anybody who knew real-estate, would never pay anywhere close to $2.5 million? Of course.

Except he ended up losing a fortune because he thought he was betting against a bunch of schmucks. Which is basically correct except the bunch of schmucks was listening to DFV not as a ""god"" - like his lawyers claim - but as a person the schmucks realized knew what he was talking about.

He was hoping to take advantage of you, lost lots of money instead, and now he's suing DFV for being too smart and y'all for following him. 

There's lots of other problems with his lawsuit but that one is enough.

Oh yeah - also, for the whole people who sold their life story stuff - the lot of you should get together and use Reddit to write your own script.
