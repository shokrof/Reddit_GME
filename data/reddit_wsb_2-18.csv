SEC confirms $GME price kept artificially low via fractional reserve,506,lmdjq5,http://archive.is/H3K8N,49,1613650835.0,,2021-02-18 14:20:35
Gabe Plotkin's Testimony Shows he's Screwed,823,lmbgxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmbgxk/gabe_plotkins_testimony_shows_hes_screwed/,194,1613644159.0,"Fellow retards, I bring to you some quotes from tomorrow's planned congressional hearing from Gabe Plotkin, aka Melvin that captures how screwed he really is and how this is far from over:

*""I want to make clear at the outset that Melvin Capital played absolutely no role in those trading platforms‚Äô decisions. In fact, Melvin closed out all of its positions in GameStop days before platforms put those limitations in place. Like you, we learned about those limits from news reports.""*

This first quote is worrisome. Why do you ask? The timeline doesnt make sense. We woke up on January 27 around 6AM to see reports solely from CNBC that Melvin closed supposedly closed its short position. You're telling me Melvin closed shorts either after-hours on January 26, or early hours January 27 and the first thing he did was telephone reporters from a known shill network to tell them about it at 6AM? If he did close, why would he care to report it to the world? Why didnt he appear in an interview to make it official if he cares so much that would air it across America? Oh right ... cause he didn't close and has a lot less to lose by lying. I suppose It's also a lot easier to lie later on and deny a phone call instead of a video as we discover now SI is actually being occulted by ETFs. Gotchya, were already beginning to see how much of a credible source Lyin' Gabe is.

&#x200B;

*""I also want to make clear at the outset that contrary to many reports, Melvin Capital was not ‚Äúbailed out‚Äù in the midst of these events. Citadel proactively reached out to become a new investor, similar to the investments others make in our fund.""*

Right the good ol'e ""We were losing money, but we had more money to burn! They wanted to be active investors when we were getting railed!"" Im a retard, but even I cant buy that. Usually investors are attracted when a firm is making money, not losing it to a bunch of retards spamming üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

*""I am here testifying today far removed from my background. I grew up in a middle-class family in Portland, Maine. I went to a public high school. I studied hard and got into a good college. Upon graduation, I did not have a job. Today, I am married with four children and my time is spent with my family and on Melvin Capital, which I founded six years ago. I named Melvin after my grandfather, who ran a convenience store. I wanted the firm to represent his values ‚Äì integrity, hard work...""*

Classic, an attempt to win compassion. If Melvin actually represents integrity, hard work, why short an All-American company to put 40K employees out of work buster? This seems fishy and I dont buy that Lyin' Gabe is a good guy who symbolizes integrity.  

&#x200B;

*""Specific to GameStop, we had a research-supported view well before the recent events. In fact, we had been short GameStop since Melvin‚Äôs inception six years earlier""*

In other words: Greedy Gabe was sitting on an infinite money glitch since 2015 and was so far up his own ass in greed, he shorted a company to 140%. Well, time to pay the piper Greedy Gabe! Infinite money glitches dont last forever. Greedy Gabe didnt close, but wants us to think he did. More lying I suppose, nothing new.

&#x200B;

*""In January 2021, a group on Reddit began to make posts about Melvin‚Äôs specific investments....Many of these posts were laced with antisemitic slurs directed at me and others. The posts said things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can‚Äôt keep getting away with this.‚Äù Others sent similarly profane and racist text messages to me.""*

The above quote is completely false and quite frankly I'm disgusted Lyin' Greedy Gabe would stoop that low in a lie. I've been lurking here since July 2020 and cant recall a single post that contained an antisemetic slur. Were also too retarded to know that his family name is Jewish. ANY comments that are racist here would get down-voted to oblivion. ALSO TEXT MESSAGES?! Holy fuck! Most retards on here including myself thought his name was actually fucking Melvin, we didnt fucking know his cellphone # (thanks u/budthespud95)

&#x200B;

*""The unfortunate part of this episode is that ordinary investors who were convinced by a misleading frenzy to buy GameStop at $100, $200, or even $483 have now lost significant amounts""*

Awww reading this gave me a fuzzy feeling inside! Greedy Gabe really cares about us retards losing our money guys! But wait, isnt it Greedy Gabe that caused Gee-Ehm-Eee investors to lose when him and his buddies kept ping ponging 100 shares back and forth at an insane frequency lowering the price each time even though volume was low af?

&#x200B;

*""I am personally humbled by what happened in January. Investors in Melvin suffered significant losses. It is now our job to earn it back""*

As much as I'd like to believe Lyin' Greedy Gabe will earn back what he lost with honest hard work, we cant believe it after all this lying. It seems Greedy Lyin' Gabe just took a sneaky approach to try and earn it back using shady ETF techniques that can be read about elsewhere.

&#x200B;

**Saved the best lie for last:**

*""There are laws governing shorting stock, and of course we always follow them""*

**Short selling to the point of 140% is following the law?! Naked short selling seems illegal though! Will Greedy Gabe attempt to convince us that ping ponging 100 shares in rapid succession to artificially suppress the price is legal too? Ok there Lyin' Greedy Gabe we've heard enough!**

&#x200B;

TLDR:  The fact Greedy Gabe continues to lie shows this frankly isnt over and he cant be trusted about short positions. Dont trust Greedy Lyin' Gabe. Greedy Gabe lies to try and get retards to throw away bananas. Retards like and keep bananas. To Alpha Centauri üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

GameStop almost SAVED the system,2186,lmal0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmal0z/gamestop_almost_saved_the_system/,251,1613641390.0,"According  to the CEO & chairman of Interactive Brokers, he said if the  trading wasn't stopped, it would've for sure crashed the system, as we  all suspected, but the truth is, the  ""system"" is just them with  trillions of dollars, and all this ""crash""  would've done, is transfer  the wealth to the rest of us, making us \*take  over\* the system.

Imo, that would've \*saved\* the system.

and  if there wasn't enough cash to payout everyone, then why not print  more, and put them into debt like they do us, since they can print  infinite money - only to bail them out, but when  it's us, ""oh no we  can't"".

Robinhood restricting trading, causing a huge wealth transfer back to Melvin and the other shorts. But I believe Robinhood was a smokescreen for what's really going on.

When we squeezed the hell out of the hedgies, they weren't going to just sit and take it. We know that 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes directly from Citadel Securities clearing our retail trades. Recent litigation from a couple months ago shows us exactly how the system works: Robinhood makes money from routing our trades for shitty execution at these clearing houses.

But what happens when the clearing house is about to get hit hard by a short squeeze on their hedge fund arm? The one lever they have is the capital requirement firms like Robinhood have to meet/deposit to clear through them.

Vlad gets on TV and tells us that the clearing firms were asking for hundred of millions in deposits from his firm, driven by volatility. While Robinhood could cover, they had no idea how high these requirements would get and panicked. And rightfully so, because Citadel Securities blew the capital requirements out of control.

The brokerages didn't make these decisions because they wanted to, they made them because they HAD to.

Now the political and media madness points a cannon at Robinhood and the real story remains hidden. Don't be fooled. The hedge fund establishment took back billions and suffered barely any blowback. They're happy to see Robinhood and others go under for their own personal gain.

TLDR for the crayon eaters: Robinhood was used by Citadel to take the fall while the hedge funds took back billions",2021-02-18 09:17:41

Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) just had price target upgraded to $80 by Susquehanna and has earnings tomorrow....unknown company with business that is booming by multiple catalysts.,18,llx5mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llx5mg/atlas_air_worldwide_holdings_aaww_just_had_price/,22,1613604997.0,"Hello fellow Autists, I posted about this company a couple weeks back and reposted the DD below. Tomorrow is earnings and multiple analysts have price targets of 77$-80$. There has also been unusual option activity for March options for the 60c. This is a mid cap that is overlooked but serious tendie potential.

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW). This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up.

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

&#x200B;

[Flying our tendies as you read](https://preview.redd.it/a5pngcjv42i61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=743ab94ab3384650ca027e929ce2d3a1112c0fdd)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.¬† In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet.

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.¬† If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company‚Äôs cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.**

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings

> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed‚Äôs last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.

> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.

*****

> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages

> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer‚Äôs e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.

*****

> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs

> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday‚Äôs highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as ‚ÄúRoaring Kitty,‚Äù will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.

*****

> # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again

> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night‚Äôs historic cold and snow that caused the state‚Äôs worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.

*****

> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII

> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. ‚ÄúYou have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,‚Äù said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It‚Äôs already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

All in on $PLTR - Let's see how it goes.,1827,lmmhh0,https://i.redd.it/132544k4k8i61.png,317,1613682759.0,,2021-02-18 23:12:39
CRSR: PSA for the anguished,127,lmmh4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmmh4j/crsr_psa_for_the_anguished/,39,1613682728.0,"My dearest precious retards,

Stocks go up and down, sometimes for days and months or even years, without any rhyme or reason, all the while having the underlying improve drastically in value. We saw this in Tesla. What is important is revisiting your thesis every time downturns happen, and asking yourself if there is a need to panic.

When you do that, you should realize (as you probably already have) that the stock is currently falling without any reason. Well a deeper look does give you a few suspects we could line up for further scrutiny:

1.	‚Å†Corsair completed an acquisition recently;
2.	‚Å†The general market is on a downturn. This was not necessarily the case immediately after IPO when players had not positioned and it had a negative beta in the weeks following. But now, they have, broader market implications are now more relevant.
3.	‚Å†The float is 25% of outstanding. As the float is very low, the stock is naturally volatile. Volatility does not mean down always, it means up and down always.
4.	‚Å†Upcoming lockup expiration which spooks some investors.

I believe all of the above reasons have no material long term downward pressure to the stock.

What matters then, you ask? Corsair is a deep value play, when it started in 1994, they were only suppliers of memory cards to over-clocking enthusiasts. There was no need to overclock yet around the year 2000 because we simply did not have the applications that needed the boost. Now we do. In 2006, Corsair saw that GPUs were increasingly more power hungry and they decided to diversify into PSU. We know now that these early decisions are what made Corsair a giant in these departments.

Corsair is now attempting the same with streaming. The gaming industry is maturing, with technologies requiring typically 30 years to fully mature. Following 2000, we are now in the final decade of its maturation, we are seeing increasing numbers in streaming being consumed as content. Corsair has seen this already, and since 2018, it has been morphing into a one stop solution for streamers, from hardware, to software (hopefully soon).

We must respect the time horizon of the founder, and give him 6 years at the least to realize the fruits of his early investments into streaming, thus 2024.

With this in mind, barring any unknown unknowns, I am confident we will see a glorious two years of growth. We already see that in every metric reported by corsair in its earnings. Rising revenue alongside rising profit margins? I believe its P/S of ~2 and the management decisions made makes the stock a steal and these downturns are a great period to accumulate, just like the whales.

Having conviction makes it all okay. Having a larger time horizon would also ease the burden you currently face.

Positions: [~1200 shares,](https://imgur.com/gallery/h7coopp) , 100% diversified into different price points of CRSR, no calls. Plan on playing the theta game after we scale Everest.

$BBBY Bed Bath & Beyond. Why I like the stock now that the squeeze has squoze,0,lmilzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmilzf/bbby_bed_bath_beyond_why_i_like_the_stock_now/,20,1613668467.0,"I have a total of 129 shares of $BBBY (and 4 Call options that are expiring tomorrow that are waaay OTM).  [91 shares in My funny-money account](https://i.imgur.com/kWBc44s.png) and [38 shares purchased yesterday in my TDAmeritrade IRA account.](https://i.imgur.com/bRZuIjb.png) As of writing this I have $3433 committed to $BBBY and will add more shares next payday. I first bought 27 shares of $BBBY during the short squeeze mania on 1/28/2021 at $36. That was fuckin stupid. But I‚Äôm buying more, now, because under $30 $BBBY is a good bet. 

The trend cone for $BBBY starting in March of 2020 has the stock at a price range between $31-$41 by June 2021: [$BBBY extended Trend Cone for 2021 (I don‚Äôt have fancy software so you‚Äôre going to have to settle for drawn-in lines).](https://i.imgur.com/O3259yh.jpg) I am expecting the price of $BBBY to exceed the $41 price for a few reasons:

&nbsp;

-**$BBBY finally started Internet sales, closed out non-core subsidiaries, and closed underperforming stores!**  Bed Bath &amp;amp;amp;amp; Beyond creating an internet sales footprint has given them a 0 to 1 net gain in sales and profitability. The last quarterly report showed a loss over last year, but that‚Äôs because they closed out their unnecessary side-hustles.  By focusing only on Home Goods they are actually very profitable right now. The next few quarterly reports are going to show very healthy profit margins. Watch this space.

&nbsp;

-**$BBBY began stock buy-back program.** Bed Bath & Beyond began an *Accelerated* stock repurchase program pledging to spend up to $675mil over the next 3 years.  [The 2nd phase of that repurchase program, pledging to spend $150mil, will end in April.](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-successfully-completes-225-million)

&nbsp;

-**Large Call Options are being placed by Institutions on $BBBY and their industry competitor $TGT.**  If you look up Call Option volume for 3/19/2021 (1 month from today) you‚Äôll see [large purchases made on shares of $TGT at $10 and $20 over it‚Äôs current value.](https://i.imgur.com/Yf88xzg.jpg) And for $BBBY you will also see large Call Option [purchases, but made at $5, $10, $15, and $20 over it‚Äôs current value.](https://i.imgur.com/aURBO9g.jpg) These large plays by big money players signal to me there is a ton interest in the future of the Home Goods sector. **All boats rise with the tide.**

&nbsp;

-**Short Interest at 27%.** A stock being shorted by 27% is actually really bad‚Ä¶ usually. But, with what we saw last year with $TSL and this year with $GME, being short can actually help your stock price if the conditions are correct. And right now the conditions are Good. $BBBY has new leadership, the company is profitable, their internet presence is bringing them 0 to 1 net gains, instutions are moving their money in, and there‚Äôs a stock buy-back program going on; all signs that short intrest bag holders being forced to purchase 33 million shares at some point are only going to help the price.

&nbsp;

-**Huge divergence on $BBBY.** If you‚Äôre like me and follow every damn stock picking twitter account, some of you might follow Dark Pool Charts (Algo Tracking) [(@darkpoolcharts)](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts?lang=en), and on 2/6/2021 they posted about $BBBY showing huge [Dark Pool](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp) trades being made on $BBBY. I reached out to them yesterday to see if there were any changes to their divergence curve for $BBBY and the sent me this: [$BBBY Divergence Curve 1/21/2021 to 2/16/2021](https://i.imgur.com/HtRP7Jd.jpg).  Divergence is when technical indicators vs the stock price trend are at odds with each other [(I think.)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divergence.asp) Technical Indicators show a **Bull**, but the price is static. Their recommendation on heavily shorted stocks with a static price trend and a Bully divergence curve like this is to buy shares and avoid calls. I‚Äôm with them. This is a good time to get in. 

&nbsp;

I sure there is some other financial stuff I can post, I wouldn‚Äôt know what any of that shit means anyways. I just really Like The Stock. $BBBY to the Moon, or maybe just 120% return by September and I‚Äôd be cool with that.",2021-02-18 19:14:27

One factor that keeps being brought up, both by RH and Citadel, is the logistics and capital requirements of delayed settlement.

Enter T+2. 

As an uncertified crayon-eating degenerate, the concept of delayed settlement is something that I was vaguely aware of, but didn‚Äôt really care about, because as long as the tendies are on my dashboard, who cares what the Wendy‚Äôs kitchen looks like. And for the majority of the lowlifes here, it likely has minimal impact in the way you trade (unless your margin YOLO goes horribly, horribly wrong). But for the big boys, it‚Äôs a bit different.

For the children who are hopping in for the first time, imagine a scenario where a bunch of apes are trained to gamble in a casino with chips. Each game is played, chips are moved around second by second, but the apes don‚Äôt materially walk out with changes in cash money until you trade the chips for money. The casino is taking care and tracking these things for you, and you don‚Äôt think about it too hard because you walk away with what you‚Äôre supposed to. But the pit boss is always watching what‚Äôs going on, and moving the cash in the back to make sure things run smoothly. Historically, this delay (measured in days) helped the boomers and ancient folk settle the paperwork involved in trades, and has continually gotten shorter over time.

T+2 is actually an acceleration of the settlement process. In 2017, the SEC finalized their move from T+3 to T+2 as standard for most market transactions. Yes, there‚Äôs variability, and some are already on a T+1 schedule, but for the most part that‚Äôs where we stand.

So why does it matter? Why does Citadel, and their hand up Vlad‚Äôs puppet ass, focus in on that as the intervention that the likely paid off investigatory committee should focus on? While I don‚Äôt have the internal data to support it, in theory, and even as stated previously by the SEC‚Äôs own press release, having acceleration of the process to keep up with technological advances has a number of benefits.

 https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-68-0

Again, why does this matter? To you and me, I doubt you notice it much. To the big boys, it means a lot. At that macro level, liquidity gives you volume, and volume gives you profits. By reducing the barriers to settling trades, they can minimize risk to margin, improving liquidity, and thereby allowing them to perform more trades per unit time.

In the grand scheme, if this goes as planned, Citadel and other MM‚Äôs will likely come out ahead in this case. The few billion they had to pay is likely a reasonable price for having a push to T+1, where they can theoretically continue to accelerate their capital growth on the scale of tens of billions of dollars over the coming years. Melvin‚Äôs got their panties in knots, and rightfully so, for getting completely fucked, but Citadel may yet come out on top from all this.

Tl;dr I think Citadel will try to convince the panel to make moves towards a T+1 standard. It‚Äôll speed up their transaction process, and print them more and more money. It‚Äôll sidestep any actual regulation to help retail, but also avoids looking overtly like they‚Äôre bullying us

Positions: I dunno, stonks only go up

EDIT 1 (11:45 PST): And here it is from Loudermilk. It‚Äôs a clear set-up: blame the market freeze on the collateral/margin regulation, Vlad agrees, then Kenneth lines it up to say how T+1 helps ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù (but some everybodies more than others).

EDIT 2 (13:20 PST): Pretty consistent trend amongst the Republican representatives to blame settlement regulations to cause the trading halt. I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting this much ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù grandstanding from the questioners, but I suppose they‚Äôve been preparing for this for some time now.",2021-02-18 18:57:03
So this guy is mad because he lost hi ‚Äúbet‚Äù and has set up a class action against Keith Gill,427,lmi0je,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmi0je/so_this_guy_is_mad_because_he_lost_hi_bet_and_has/,119,1613666214.0,"I‚Äôm sorry but what is wrong here!?

I don‚Äôt think he also researched properly, I don‚Äôt ever recall Keith saying or recommending ‚ÄúGo buy GME.‚Äù From what I can see he just stated what he did, his position and his reasons, it seemed pretty open to me.

Fundamental error in the docket for the lawsuit against DFV,179,lmhbl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmhbl3/fundamental_error_in_the_docket_for_the_lawsuit/,72,1613663692.0,"Out of interest, I looked up the docket for the case against u/deepfuckingvalue and there seems to be an incredibly smooth-brained error in it regarding the dates of the naked calls the plaintiff sold. 

Docket:
https://www.hbsslaw.com/sites/default/files/case-downloads/gamestop/02-16-21-gamestop-complaint.pdf

Part IV D 61 says:

*61. Plaintiff sold call option contracts (representing 2,000 shares) at a strike price of $100 on January 26, 2021 with expiration date of January 19,2021, while Gill‚Äôs manipulative social media conduct drove the market for GameStop shares into an unjustified frenzy (above $400).*

So he sold calls (naked calls it seems) on **Jan 26** with an expiry date of **Jan 19**? Could he please teach me how to do that?

Also, this link shows that on Jan 26th GME opened at $88.56, had a low of 80.20, high of 150.00 and closed at 147.98. ‚ÄúAbove $400‚Äù is irrelevant to his case. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/

However, he claims to have been forced to pay $300 and $315 (per share I assume) to cover his naked short. I can only assume that this means his options were exercised automatically by his broker after-hours and that he simply didn‚Äôt bother to buy the naked calls back before close on the expiry date when they were less than half of that. 

*63. Because of the market frenzy caused by Gill‚Äôs manipulative conduct and MML‚Äôs and MassMutual‚Äôs failure to supervise, Plaintiff was forced to ‚Äúcover‚Äù the options contracts by purchasing back offsetting GameStop options contracts representing Gamestop shares at unwarrantedly and unprecedented inflated prices of $300 and $315 unmoored to the true value of GameStop shares, causing Plaintiff to incur substantial loses.*

If anyone can explain otherwise, please let me know. 

Additionally:

Part I (1)

*...In order to disguise that the aim of his social-media campaign was simply to increase the worth of his GameStop shares by creating a demand for the stock, Gill took on the fake persona of an **amateur, everyday fellow**, who simply was looking out for the little guy.*

So he thinks that people are more inclined to follow the advice of an amateur than a professional? Interesting approach. If I was building a house I certainly wouldn‚Äôt take the advice of Joe next door over that of a professional builder, but maybe he would. 

There are several other parts which also make me go ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù but so the automod doesn‚Äôt spam me I‚Äôll finish here. I‚Äôm just a smooth-brained clown but the plaintiff and his legal team seem to rival my level of mental incompetence. 

TLDR: the lawsuit claims he sold naked calls with an expiry date one week **prior to** purchase and several other weird arguments/errors.",2021-02-18 17:54:52

Why Sabre (SABR) is the ultimate recovery play,59,lmfzcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmfzcb/why_sabre_sabr_is_the_ultimate_recovery_play/,86,1613659024.0,"  

**Setting the Stage:**

Sabre Corporation is the leading technology provider to the global travel industry. Sabre‚Äôs software, data, mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace, which processes more than $120 billion of global travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers. 

Historically, Sabre's airline operations, booking management, and hospitality solutions platforms have been stalwart producers of revenue and profits. However, with the airline industry crushed by pandemic-related travel restrictions, Sabre saw its own business prospects sink dramatically. Sales plunged 92% in the second quarter of 2020, with losses in the first nine months of the year adding up to more than $965 million.

Yet Sabre is positioning itself for a bounce in airline and travel activity. Late last year, the company partnered with Google to launch the artificial intelligence-driven [Sabre Travel AI platform](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/22/why-shares-of-sabre-are-soaring-today/). Sabre and Google intend for the platform to offer customers personalized content to boost margins. As investors see that Sabre can put the past behind it and return toward a more sustainable growth trajectory, the stock could move higher, and just getting back to where shares started 2020 would represent a double from here.

**BRIEF SUMMARY OF BULLISH THESIS**

During the biggest shock in history to the travel industry Sabre has been actively positioning itself to dominate the industry when travel recovers. While everyone in the industry has been getting their teeth kicked in, Sabre has been expanding their network and modernizing their business. They have been upgrading their infrastructure, forming **thousands** of new partnership deals, streamlining their workforce and cutting costs. Pre-Covid SABR was trading for around $23/share, it is currently at $12/share with a 4 billion market cap and I believe is positioned to bounce back higher than its pre-covid numbers. SABR has been able to make strategic partnerships and is better positioned to withstand and recover than its competitors. Vaccinations are rolling out around the globe and I believe there is pent up demand for people wanting to get out and travel. There is significant short interest and I believe that SABR is positioned to recover **BEFORE** the rest of the travel industry as they are actively growing their network and client base and have added 2,100 new clients this quarter.

You're unironically retarded if you're still using Robinhood,6993,lme4i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/,943,1613652787.0,"Look, I get that some of you genuinely tried to transfer to another broker, but that legitimate gambling addiction that you have to the stonk market prevented you from closing out all your positions and letting your trades settle (even though if you did you probably wouldn't have lost 80% by FOMO'ing into weed).

But by staying in Robinhood, you scream ""Oh please daddy Vlad Tenev, please impale my asshole one more time like you did with Geee Emmm eeeEEEEE!!!"" 

# Why you should use a real broker and stop using Robinhood:

**Not being glued to a chart all day**

How many of you have your eyes glued to a fucking chart all day long because Robinhood is mobile and looks cool? This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.

**Access to penny stocks**

Ever want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.

I wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.

**Actual customer support**

I haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.

**Instant transfers**

Again, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. 

**Huge assets under management**

Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.

**Cool desktop/web apps**

Wanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1.

**Cons of not using Robinhood**:

I'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood. 

\- Looks cool

\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)

\- Easy to use

How The US Will Send TSM To The Moon,50,lme2a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme2a0/how_the_us_will_send_tsm_to_the_moon/,51,1613652565.0," Hey y'all.

I wrote a post yesterday about TSM and the current automotive semiconductor shortage that you can check out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm\_and\_the\_global\_automotive\_semiconductor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm_and_the_global_automotive_semiconductor/)

The gist was that TSM is the biggest producer of semiconductors which are experiencing a huge shortage right now, and that the Biden administration is looking into ""immediate action"" to fix the shortage. I think this will be great for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks.

One question I got was: how does American intervention benefit TSM?

My answer: The Chips for America Act.

The Chips for America Act intends to encourage domestic production of semiconductors and was passed as part of the most recent defense spending bill last month. The act has already been authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act and last week American semiconductor manufacturers wrote Biden a letter to fund it.

Section 9905 of the act is titled FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS AND MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS SUPPLY CHAINS and here are some screenshots.

You can look at the whole act here: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text)

Basically the act creates a fund that can give TSM $$$ to supply the US with semiconductors, and allocates funds to ""secure the supply chain,"" i.e. secure it against China. Closer US ties to TSM is great for the company since one of the main concerns investors have over TSM is the possibility of a Chinese takeover.

TLDR: Biden is being pressured to fund an act which would give TSM $$$ and help to defend it from China. This is great for TSM.

>Top White House officials are engaged in trying to resolve the shortage, which has presented an early challenge to Biden‚Äôs administration. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are personally involved in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies‚Äô supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.  
The spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private.  
Taiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views it as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.  
The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson added.  
The formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S.",2021-02-18 14:49:25

Not every play is a short squeeze. Sometimes the nearly bankrupt companies that you guys are looking at are actually set to go bankrupt. Every once in a while, this is not the case and the stock will go up. However, even if this is this case, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a short squeeze is on the horizon. The same way anyone can find the P/E of a stock, anyone with access to the right data can give you an estimate of short interest. This information can definitely be part of a decent analysis, but to suggest any stock with some shorts on it is a short squeeze is pretty misleading.

Disclaimer, I took a bunch of profit (few mil) already, these are some shares which I was trading during the squeeze which I decided to yolo and hold long term as a tribute to DFV/Cohen and gang.

&#x200B;

Not expecting any squeeze type event to happen, but hoping that Ryan Cohen doesn't bail and delivers on at least trying to execute parts of his proclaimed prophecy. I think even if GME can show they are in the midst of transformation (whether successful or not) the stock will at least go back to a $8-9B valuation. After that, it's all up to how the business actually performs mid 2022 onwards. I'm confident that given GameStop has just had one of the greatest global viral marketing campaigns in history, there will be significant new interest in the brand.

&#x200B;

I'm looking forward to starting to get actual fundamentals related catalysts once again as the year progresses. I miss the days of waking up to announcements such as the Microsoft customer LTV revenue share agreement.

Basically - HOLDING LONG TERM, have faith in the original thesis.

- Big time revenue 
- Over $3 billion cash on hand
- Housing market on fire and interest rates will remain low. This means they'll make even more money now to help expand into other future business areas 
- Undervalued/low P/E ratio (6x)
- Billionaire owner in Dan Gilbert

- 1 billion dollar buyback

What I want to address here is the buyback program. The buyback can't be initiated if RKT has material information that could affect the stock price. They can only buyback once this information has been released to the public. 

During their Q3 call, they said that they have a new financial partner that they would announce in early '21 - well guess what, it's February now so it's going to be soon. If that's still the case, it's likely that they're planning to reveal this information soon, maybe even during their earnings call next week on the 25th.

Think about what could happen here. Blowout earnings,  and partnership details are revealed plus the buyback is initiated. Do you not see the potential here? All of those 3 things happening in tandem will push the price up higher and on top of that you have 30% short interest, which makes zero sense to me why this company is even shorted in the first place considering how much dough they make.

I have done my dd go do yours. 

To get you started on your wheel-churning ape adventure, let me introduce your next favorite boomer stock of the decade: AT&T (A**, T*TT*ES AND TENDIES) 

$T has been popping, and if you live under a rock, you don‚Äôt know that OTM calls for 03/05 30 and 30.5 have skyrocketed. And this is where it gets crazy. [This chain of calls ](https://imgur.com/vZLHCJ6) is a ridiculous damn approach to a boomer dividend 10cent yielding stock with less volatility then your underpants. Does it matter? Maybe, not really, point is if this goober is willing to throw in a pot of gold and bet that AT&T hits 30.5 in three weeks, then I‚Äôm sure as hell willing to grab a contract and worst case scenario lose 20 bucks. 6d ago these contracts were getting scooped up for a ridiculous .10. They are still low, and at the time of writing this, $T had an unheard of day with a huge increase up to 29.56. You do the math. I‚Äôm willing to bet a Texas Roadhouse date night on it, hell I‚Äôm in for a lot more then that at this point. While most of this is based on the option chain from the past few weeks, there are a few potential turning points that could be happening for $T-

AST SPACEMOBILE- first and only cell network space-based and accessible to standard smartphones. Nothing confirmed, but AT&T have been in touch with them, per an FCC filing that lays out a plan for AT&T to use there NA cell coverage after there satellite launch, which would be f*cking huge.

5G AIRWAVE AUCTION - AT&T is bidding for air-wave licenses and winners will be announced right in time for contracts to expy, weird timing right? If they do grab a large stake of the licenses, it will set them up for MASSIVE success in the 5g space. 

There is a leak going around that PLTR & AT&T may be working together. Don‚Äôt get too excited palantapes, but [this LinkedIn profile looks promising to the rumors ](https://i.redd.it/of9onix9izg61.png), and I think a big project combined with there Luxoft client partnership could set up something huge, definitely enough to blow the lid off of what‚Äôs only a 4% needed percent increase to get ITM. 

TLDR: HUGE OPTIONS ACTIVITY ON $T, CALLS ALREADY UP 100%. POSSIBILITY OF A CATALYST BEFORE 05 LOOKS GOOD APES! TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION. HURRY UP AND GET ON. 

POSITIONS : 36 (already sold 14) contracts for 30C, 15 for 30.5


2/18 9:22 - Thanks for the support, glad to see some people who realize it‚Äôs a level headed bet. But also remember it is a bet!

Alright check this shit out,

DermTech(DMTK) Market Cap 1.8B is a biogenomics stock intent on replacing scalpel or punch biopsy tests for melanoma at a cheaper price point and ease of use(think instead of a Dr. performing the biopsy a nurse can now handle it in 5 min).

The idea is *non-invasive precision* melanoma diagnosis. Higher care, lower cost. Gene expression vs cell examination.

As of February of this year they increased their patient pool by [6 million](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/dermtech-enters-agreement-blue-cross-210100658.html) off of a single state contract with BCBS and that means 49 more contracts to go, baby. I think the 4.5M they spent on sales and marketing last reported quarter is just beginning to pay off. Which is good because you guessed it, their balance sheet looks like any other biotech company hobbling down the road to profitability. Although they have surprisingly kept their debt in check.

[I wouldn't worry.](https://imgur.com/a/wqNrDtK)

RTW Investments is a little big bank with a hard on for future science, meaning they're throwing all the cash out DermTech needs until they can stand on their own. We're looking at a potential ARKG holding as well. Share dilution is unlikely with the extremely high liquidity they are sporting. Someone holding this stock has the last name Wood, do I need to say more?

**300%** YoY *increase* in total assets from **18.2M** to **57M**

**18%** YoY *decrease* in total liabilities from **5.7M** to **4.7M**

Quick ratio of motha fuckin 12.xx

The product is boring AS FUCK and that's why it's going to sell like hot cakes man. It makes healthcare workers lives easier and increases profit margin. You think medical billing is going to reduce biopsy prices just because they're getting a more price efficient product from their supplier? This is America! Not to mention that the dermatologist only administers the biopsy, but they have no clue how to do a fucking PLA test so they pay the good ol' lab techs at DMTK.

You're not convinced, I'm retarded. You've already deduced I have no fucking clue what is going and you're right, but I've got a kicker.

[Listen to the CFO](https://wsw.com/webcast/btig3/dmtk/1732752) (15:20 mark)explain their current development and testing for an at-home app/kit pipeline. It's like Ancestry DNA kits except they actually fucking do something. You know the gist, take a test mail it off and you receive a really cool in-depth letter about what type of skin cancer you have and how fast you should get it treated.

I believe [$GNOG]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GNOG?p=GNOG) has nowhere to go but up.

[$GNOG]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GNOG?p=GNOG), Golden Nugget Online Gaming, first caught my interest after a buddy pointed them out while they were still a SPAC under the name LCA. An ‚ÄúiGaming‚Äù company staking its claim in the rapidly growing online gambling arena it competes with the better known Draft Kings ([$DKNG]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DKNG?p=DKNG)) and Penn National Gaming ([$Penn]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PENN?p=PENN)). What first separated it was the fact that it was already profitable. 

[Profitability comparison]( https://imgur.com/a/kgK7uDd)

GNOG has a price target of $27, but has gone down since the merger from a high of $26 as LCA to its current price of $17.20. [For comparison]( https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/draftkings-lists-on-the-nasdaq-following-spac-merger-up-more-than-5-in-early-trading-2020), DKNG was trading at $17.53 before its merger, and went up 17% by market open. Wait, you say, is that not a bad sign for GNOG? I do not believe this to be the case. DKNG went up immediately following the merger despite hemorrhaging money.  If you look for news, media coverage, or any real attention over GNOG there is none.  I believe the only thing currently keeping GNOG at its current point is how few eyes are watching it. The [numbers]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GNOG/key-statistics?p=GNOG) give no reason whatsoever for the slow drop and stagnation. The attention towards other sectors and stocks such as $GME, $TLRY, and $PLTR I believe is a much more likely culprit. 


GNOG should only continue to grow as more states legalize online gambling. GNOG began its operations in Michigan on January 22 of this year, and plans to expand to Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Illinois next. Pennsylvania at the very least is slated for 2021 beginning of operations. These are huge markets to expand to for the company, and will only lead to growth. On top of this they have managed to stay at the forefront of online gambling technology, and were the first to launch a live dealer online instead of a computer dealer. They are planning to release 80 new games in 2021, and have won operator of the year for the 4th time in a row at the [EGR North America Virtual Awards 2020](https://egr.global/northamerica/news/golden-nugget-wins-fourth-consecutive-egr-na-operator-of-the-year-award/). In fact, if [compared]( https://investorplace.com/2021/01/gnog-stock-is-worth-33-92-per-share-or-65-percent-more-than-today/) to DKNG then the price should be above $30. The current price is an excellent buy in point for a stock that is likely to skyrocket in the coming years as more states legalize online gambling.

TL;DR
[GNOG low. GNOG should be high. DKNG loses massive money and is high. GNOG makes massive money and is low. GNOG can only go to moon.]( https://imgur.com/a/kgK7uDd)

Illegal Tactics and DTCC/Prime Broker Complicity In Naked Shorting & Retail Shutdown of Gee Em Eee (Read Ahead of 2/18 GameStop Congress Hearing) *Repost for Visibility*,2094,lma1ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lma1ev/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/,76,1613639715.0,"*Note that the below text is a re-post of a previous post for visibility. If you've already read this would appreciate an upvote for visibility!*

**TLDR: GameStop‚Äôs Congress hearing is on Feb 18th, they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension, potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th, the day the short squeeze was going to kick off.** (stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using)

Thesis: On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1/28 (the day the short squeeze would‚Äôve happened had there been no market intervention), DTCC (clearing house monopoly) shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers **(which privately own the DTCC)** from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity. I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock, as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1/28.

In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) (which I recommend reading for some context) I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME, and how Prime Brokers (consisting of banks like Goldman, Morgan, etc) and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting. This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1/28 because had the short squeeze happened, the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares. This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers, the culpability of Prime Brokers (and that of the DTCC) in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well.

A quick primer on what a Prime Broker is: Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short- selling business. They lend out securities and cash, you can think of them as the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù in a casino: They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings. According to Matt Taibi, ‚ÄúUnder the original concept, if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock themselves, and what this does is enable short-sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares. (source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)). (I highly recommend you read[ Matt Taibi‚Äôs article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/) on naked shorting and how it was used to take down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. There are so many parallels with GME it‚Äôs hard to miss. It‚Äôs amazing to consider that 12 years after this article was published and brought to public awareness, the problem of naked shorting still exists as a systemic issue.)

Prime Brokers have a long history of being associated with naked shorting. To highlight a few examples, Prime Brokers like Merill Lynch and Goldman have long been implicated for naked shorting Overstock.com ([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/), [https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx\_lm\_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f](https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx_lm_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f)). Another example is when Goldman‚Äôs Prime Brokerage was implicated by the SEC in 2016 and got away with a small fine of 16 million (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)). An example that very recently came in the news is a story where CIBC, BOA, UBS and TD Bank Prime Brokerages are accused of facilitating naked short selling and using counterfeit stock to attack and bring the stock price of a company from $34.77 to $1.83 (Source: [https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548)).

The DTCC also has a very long history of being associated with naked shorting. The Wall Street Journal noted that 1% of the DTCC‚Äôs volume end in failure to deliver which ‚Äú**have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices‚Ä¶ DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** ‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)). The DTCC has also had numerous complaints submitted to the SEC for enabling naked shorting (source: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm)) and have been sued tens or hundreds of times for assisting naked shorts (source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/) and [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

On 1/28 Robinhood received a letter from the DTCC at 4 am requiring them to halt trading or come up with [3 billion dollars](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/), which Robinhood did not have, and therefore with one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling. Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know, by shutting buy but only allowing sell, the price is bound to fall. Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also [crosstrade in the dark pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/) (‚Äúprivate‚Äù stock markets that retail is shut out of, more on this later), and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day.

With retail abruptly being shut out from buy (even cash accounts were shut out, which didn‚Äôt make sense) and only allowed to sell, almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot (which triggered the Congress hearing) and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood. Personally and in hindsight, I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat. When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred, I‚Äôll narrow it down to three entities, Shorts and their stakeholders (ie Citadel), Prime Brokers and the DTCC.

It‚Äôs important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC. Working backwards, if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it, I believe the DTCC, Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel (who provides 40% of Robinhood‚Äôs revenue) brazenly manipulated the market on 1/28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved. **I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME.**

**The main Prime Brokers (based on assets held under custodianship) of Melvin Capital are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan** [**https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf**](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)**, all three firms sit on the board of the DTCC** [**https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board**](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)

An interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts, they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think most likely happened.

If you‚Äôve read up to this point, you might be thinking what can I do about this? I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can‚Äôt do anything, that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation, and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done. I feel this sometimes too, but remember:

**A single voice can be drowned out, but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard. Ape Strong Together.**

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

*Edit (Adding based on a reader's comment): In your letter to your congressman, please ask to request the Congressional Research Service(CRS) to publish a report on the matter. CRS is Congress‚Äôs private think tank. If they publish a report, IT WILL be read throughout the Hill, and taken more seriously than anything we could ever do as constituents*

What follows should probably be a separate post, but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors. Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future. Retail investors might not have the same tricks, resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do, but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis, we will figure out their game and effectively adapt.

Feel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used:

**Rampant Naked Shorting -** With the [extremely high number of Fail to Delivers (FTID](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)) , [short interest being as high as 226% recently](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl), [and institutions alone holding a staggering 177% of the total float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the) (likely due in large part to counterfeit shares), signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares. I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts, using [the laddering of naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) (aka short ladder attack), executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price. I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks, especially on the week of Monday February 1st, which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling.

**Masking Shorts with by Shorting ETFs that hold GME** (Can't link due to WSB, will put in comments)

**Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools** \- Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from [crosstrading with darkpools (the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade‚Ä¶)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/). Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to, where short side funds can purchase securities ‚Äúoff market‚Äù and then sell ‚Äúon-market‚Äù, with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying.

**Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs**. Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in [this risk alert](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) and which I elaborate in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). Essentially it‚Äôs the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest %. If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible, then you can see why this strategy would be very effective.

**Using way out-of-money call options to obscure true short interest.** You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd. Later it was identified as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options (since at 800 its way out of money) to obscure their short positions (with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen)

One thing I want to note, particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing: Retail investors were not incited to pump GME. **Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds**, whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy, and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226% of float, meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company. **Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters, which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy**. The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair, but instead, financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying, hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market. The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze, but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them.

If this post was useful (and I hope it was! Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes), please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide. **The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change, and it‚Äôs extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings (and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened**.) I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice. Again, I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case, but **if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME, I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information. In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made.**

Ps. If you‚Äôve read to the end, I‚Äôll leave you with a few more thoughts and reminders:

\- If I were to distill life into one thing, it would be to never lose hope.

\- Remember that if you‚Äôve lost money in any way shape or form, don‚Äôt be depressed, money can always be made back and the important thing is to maintain a good attitude.

\- Only invest what you can afford to lose.

\- Perhaps the most important factor in good investing is patience.

The internet is a wild place. Any one of us retards could have hit the lotto by randomly buying leaps in some meme stock then proceeding to act like a sevant even though it would have been just dumb luck. 

But you were different. You did your homework for years, learning about the market and understanding what your strategy would be, all while taking care of your family and no doubt just being an all-around good dude through some incredibly difficult times since 08‚Äô. I was amazed to find you when I saw your analysis of GameStop about a month ago. Sincere, funny, and most importantly, incredibly sharp. You earned every single penny of your gains through years of honing your analysis skills to find DeeeeeeeepFuckingValue.

I posted this, this morning but the mods or the bot mods removed my post. So I'm posting again because freedom of speech!

Hi guys. Just wanted to update everyone as yesterday we smashed through resistance again. We now have a higher floor and higher ceiling. We hit $5.50 in after hours and are currently at $5.59 in the pre market. I believe we can see $7 today and $10 this or next week. In my opinion anything under $10 is a discount right now as fda approval is imminent. Holding this thing at $10 as we wait for the 180 day sensor seems fair value to me as it can skyrocket to $20-$40 after the approval. I see this stock at being somewhere around $40-$50 by end of year. Possibly $100 if everything goes right. Below is the info from my last post. It is not too late to jump in on SENS as in my opinion it is still undervalued. If you are looking for a good entry point I would buy some now and if it dips buy more. I don't see it dipping below $4.60 as that would be a heavy level of resistance. However we could see $7 before we ever see $4 again.

Their product is better than everything on the market and extremely price competitive. they have a 90 say sensor implant for diabetes patients out now. Their competitors only have a 15 day sensor and costs like 3 times as much. health insurance covers the eversense sensor by senseonics. they have a 180 day sensor about to be approved by the fda and a 360 day sensor both of which are available in europe right now. Their competitors dexcom has a 38 billion market cap and right now SENS has a 1 billion market cap. SENS is currently trading at $3.80 and will hit $10 soon. It could easily 10x in the next year and take over the market. SENS to the moon üíé üëä ü¶ß üí™ together!

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.

‚Äã

I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 11'531'000 13'087'000 14'853'000 16'857'000 This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country Diabetes Product cost Operating revenue Customers Market share USA 12.2020 30'000'000 99 10'016'000 101'000 0.3% USA 12.2021 30'000'000 99 16'857'000 170'000 0.5%‚Äã

I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.

‚Äã

Country Diabetes Product cost Operating revenue Customers Market share Switzerland 500'000 99 250'000 2'500 0.5% Germany 9'500'000 99 4'700'000 47'500 0.5% Italy 3'300'000 99 1'630'000 16'500 0.5% Netherland 1'300'000 99 640'000 6'500 0.5% Poland 2'300'000 99 1'130'000 11'500 0.5% Spain 3'600'000 99 1'780'000 18'000 0.5%‚Äã

With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

GME is going to crash, and its going to crash hard. Lets face up, once the people who bought in at semi reasonable levels wake up  and realized there wont be another short squeeze(and its debatable if there ever was one or it was just a retail buying frenzy), they are going to dump their stock to keep some of their money. Most retail traders who got in probably cant afford to piss away  money on stocks, and will want to preserve any gains they have or minimize any losses.

Now that thats out of the way, its time to discuss my newly found trading strategy. After years of losing money, I noticed that when a stock moves sharply in a direction, the respective options increase in value, even if they are not in the money! I also noticed, that using multiplication, the more options you have, the more money you make if they appreciate in value. If you combine these two things, you reach the obvious conclusion. ""If you think a stock is going to go move, buy lots of cheap options!""

PLTR Bullish Short Put Position (Informative),48,lm7imq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7imq/pltr_bullish_short_put_position_informative/,44,1613632385.0,"Shorted the PLTR $25 put expiring 2/19/21.

I was writing an explanation of this trade to someone else, so I included it here.

Every option has a buyer and a seller on each side. By selling a put, I am creating a new put option and selling it on the open market. This put is a contract that gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares to me at $25 each. This put was cash secured, so I am using $2,500 as collateral for each put. I sold them for $53 each ($0.53 per share). If PLTR stays above $25.01 this week, then on Friday's close the trade will end, and I will get my $2,500 back as well as the $53 (2% return). However, if PLTR closes below $24.47 on Friday 2/19, then the buyer earns the difference. For example, if PLTR closes at $23.97, the buyer will purchase 100 shares on the open market and then sell them to me for $24.47 each. The buyer will earn $50, and I will own 100 shares at a $24.47 cost basis.

This derivative trade is essentially buying shares with a limit order at $24.47 where you are paid if it doesn't execute.

Just a good time to BTFD.  No one wins betting against Papa Elon.

I likely will look back on this shitpost and regret it in 6 months when $TSLA is at $4,200, but the idea has been in my head for weeks now and hasn't changed.  $TSLA has gone on an incredible tear but I think higher steel prices (and higher prices for all commodities) is what finally brings it back down.  My thinking:

- The momentum play has finally run out.  There just aren't as many people chasing this thing higher as there were last year.  Just look at all the non-GME DD posts here.  Everyone is looking for the next thing to moon.

- Their margins are going to get squeezed for the next two quarters as the majority of their product is made from steel, aluminum and other commodities.  Inflation, beyond current expectations is coming.  Today's PPI came in almost double the current estimates.  The Fed can say they're not going to worry about inflation now, but that will only cause prices to run higher and faster.

- Interest rates are going to start increasing.  This is a big issue because all those deposits that Tesla has only lock in your place in line - not the price of the vehicle or the financing.  If production costs increase they can either eat it in their margins, or try and pass along the costs.  I'm sure many people will still pay the going rate for a Tesla but just the possibility of that happening will hurt the stock.

- Finally, the competition for high end EVs is really ramping up.  I really think Tesla is best in class and will likely stay that way, but people will shift their attention to the newest thing and hype up the ""oh no too much quality competition"" angle.

Now the important part - is there a solid way to play this, looking at the premiums on put options right now? No.  Would I sell covered calls against my shares before the premiums and IV come down?  Yes.  But this is just a Wendy's so thanks for letting me vent at the drive thru.

They are now a boomer tech corp + a high growth, cloud native data-warehousing as as service company. CEO Steve McMillan decided to break out a new metric on the earnings call... cloud-based annual recurring revenues. This was the first mention of this metric and their success in the cloud. It shocked longs and shorts alike.

It sent the stock up from $27.50 to $53. It has since had a healthy pull-back with good support around $45. Here's why I think now is a great entry point:

* Recurring revenue for subscriptions on the public cloud hit $106m, **up 165%** from $40m a year earlier. 
* For the full year of 2021, public cloud ARR is expected to increase by **at least 100% year-over-year**. I.e.) greater than $212M cloud-based ARR by next year.
* If Teradata were new to the market, and had zero other business outside of it's cloud business, it's current growth and revenue would lead us to value it like a growth stock. Let's take a look at those valuations for related businesses: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x), DDOG (60x)
* If we took a conservative 50x then Teradata's cloud product alone would value the company at \~$5.3B. (The current stock price gives it a market cap of \~$5B). But obviously the $5.3B figure doesn't even consider the rest of their business... which makes up for 94% of revenue and allows them to stay profitable while they transition heavily into a cloud-first offering.

If their business was valued at \~$2.5B before this news about their successful transition into a subscription/service based company, and their current cloud business should be valued somewhere in the ballpark between $4.5B and $10B based on comparative valuations, then I think $7.5B is an accurate valuation.

Right now they're suffering from the entirety of their company being looked at as a value stock. In reality, it should be looked at as 2 things. A value boomer tech stock \*AND\* a high growth cloud native company. Put those two things together, then you have a fair value of around $70-75, and it could jump higher if their cloud services get valued anywhere close to Snowflake.

tl:dr;

$TDC to $70 or higher within a couple weeks as tutes start to readjust their valuations. I hold shares and 3/19 $50C. This definitely isn't financial advice. I really like this stock. Seems to be incorrectly, or at least inconsistently valued and I think that will come to light over the next couple weeks.",2021-02-18 08:27:13

PLTR the next FB? YOLO EITHER WAY,177,lm5vgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm5vgg/pltr_the_next_fb_yolo_either_way/,103,1613627914.0,"YOLO PLTR NOW DD (updated)

Updating my thoughts on PLTR from earlier this afternoon, but I just wanted to share an interesting case study from Facebook‚Äôs IPO back in 2012:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/id/49824482

TLDR: FB and PLTR have many similarities in that they are cutting edge companies that disrupted the entire tech industry. The similarities are eerie: FB had a bearish lock-up period, just like PLTR.

Now, FB was off 40% from its IPO as the lockup approached (PLTR is up triple, but strangely ~40% off the highs), nevertheless, there is much skeptism with PLTR as there was with FB in 2012.

People wondered whether FB would be able to transition from PC to mobile... the Street questions if Palantir can secure a stable corporate client base. There‚Äôs worries about the lock-up expiration with PLTR, just like with FB in 2013 (see the link).

But here‚Äôs the whopper: I don‚Äôt believe this lock-up will be nearly as bad as ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù speculates. Sure, certain directors @PLTR might sell some, but why would they kill it all now? There‚Äôs too much potential.

Cathie Wood reaffirmed her support forholding this bad boy for 5 years by DOUBLING her stake yesterday. You‚Äôre a fool if you think Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are thinking much differently.

This negativity is overblown. Perhaps we see $25 on PLTR, but think: how much lower can we go? We are stuck at a $50B valuation right now, compared to $80B for boomer-based Snowfuck ($SNOW). 

A software that looks like COD (yes Call of Duty)-Gotham Foundry (bad ass name btw) that can prevent terrorist attacks and catch Osama Bin Laden??

A predictive AI that can help manage supply chains and forecast growth/risk? A tech wizard that helps oil companies strategize how best to transition to the renewables era?

Name me one damn company that does any of that, much less ALL of it and stores the data on a mega cloud for proprietary/client computing?

If you feel queasy or unsure, just ask yourself: who else does what PLTR does? A mega, all-seeing, AI mastermind that can solve problems across defense, technology, financials, and energy? 

Certainly ain‚Äôt POS C3.AI or Spermflake. By the way- those other names are wayyyy more *overvalued* than King Palantir.

So I‚Äôm personally doubling down and buying more shares/calls tomorrow. This is simply the greatest firesale engineered on a looming corporate giant in financial history, and we retail investors & enthusiasts are chumps if we sit this one out.

This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze or a big short or any other financial gimmick. This is just about markets recognizing talent, and as more retail investors (us strong ü¶ç) and institutions (who are currently üåàüêª on PLTR) get in, $PLTR will send it to the next dimension.

POSITIONS (very highly requested): https://imgur.com/gallery/pldEQsP

UPDATED (2/18): WOW! Mama Wood just bought 5.3 million more shares TODAY, adding it to her flagship ETF $ARKK for the first time. Feeling ballsy enough to say the lock up is over and to Mars we go. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

BUY BUY BUY

Reload, double down, do it all!

This is the firesale of a lifetime on the next Google/Facebook. On days like today, you BUY PLTR with a take-no-prisoners attitude. 

Considering Cathie Wood doubled her PLTR stake yesterday, I don‚Äôt feel too fucked in the head.

Reloading on shares and $40 calls, and if this corrects to $25, Wall Street will be asking me to do some pretty ridiculous DCAG trades.

"$PLUG Power is Extremely Oversold, Here‚Äôs Why",102,lm5ubt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm5ubt/plug_power_is_extremely_oversold_heres_why/,94,1613627828.0,"$PLUG is current trading down ~25% from last months ATH of $75.49 to about $56 at the time of this writing, despite a strong forward outlook and many huge news releases/partnerships announced in the last couple of months. This is why I believe $PLUG has been consolidating and is currently massively undervalued.

**Purchase Orders & Partnerships with Walmart & Amazon**
$PLUG‚Äôs largest single customers are currently the retail & e-commerce behemoths, Walmart and Amazon. Both companies utilizing their hydrogen fuel cell packs and refueling stations to power light commercial vehicles in stores/distribution centers (think forklifts and the like for LTC vehicles). These are both huge name customers throwing their weight behind Plug Power with no indication of switching away from their products, but will continue to need more as they respectively, continue to grow.

**SK Group/Renault/Acciona S.A Partnership Announcements**

[SK Group & Plug Power form a strategic partnership to further build out the hydrogen infrastructure in Korea and later the remainder of the Asian markets.](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-and-South-Korean-SK-Group-to-Form-a-Strategic-Partnership-to-Accelerate-Hydrogen-Economy-Expansion-in-Asian-Markets-Plug-Power-to-Receive-1.5-Billion-Strategic-Investment-From-SK-Group/default.aspx)

These three major announcements push Plug‚Äôs offerings beyond U.S borders opening up revenue from hundreds of millions of potential consumers, both civilian and corporate customers. Clean Hydrogen as a major energy source in SK, hydrogen power LTCV and mass market consumer vehicles with Renault in EU, and reaching Spain‚Äôs goal of 100% clean energy in only 9 years by 2030 with Acciona S.A.

**Plug Power Appoints new Chief Marketing Officer from primary competitor, Bloom Energy.**

On Friday 2/12/2021, [Plug Power announced they‚Äôve brought on Preeti Pande](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-Announces-Preeti-Pande-as-New-Chief-Marketing-Officer/default.aspx) as their new CMO who‚Äôs main task is to promote brand recognition, and push Plug Power‚Äôs hydrogen solutions abroad.

**Biden-Harris LOVE clean energy**

Its no secret the current administration is funneling a metric fuck load of money toward Green/Clean energy. Including [targeting low-cost hydrogen production within their newly launched Climate Innovation Working Group](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-Announces-Preeti-Pande-as-New-Chief-Marketing-Officer/default.aspx). This coupled with the [US Department of Energy‚Äôs $100 million in funding to further R&D clean energy initiatives via the Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy‚Äôs (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 program.](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-100-million-transformative-clean-energy-solutions-supporting). Hydrogen is extremely clean and will only get more and more efficient with time.

**Major Institutional Investor Backing**

[52% of shares are held by BIG boys & girls on Wall Street.](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/plug/institutional-holdings)
[Cramer likes it too or whatever, so boomers like it and are going to shove their boomer money into shares](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-call-me-a-hydrogen-believer-and-plug-power-will-make-it-all-happen-15533499)

**Ok, so why did it crash this week?**

‚ÄúSome fucking country in Europe took a shit [(Norway)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-u.s.-fuel-cell-stocks-are-crashing-2021-02-17), Let them do what they want to fucking do. Our market‚Äôs solid.‚Äù
Norway is opening some hydrogen facility to expand their energy dependent economy. All of their exports are oil, now they want to dip their toes in hydrogen. Norway is tiny, and really a non-issue imo. Their primary focus is still oil, natural gas, and fish lmao. Long term this could be good as the region becomes more accepting of hydrogen and Plug Power, as the current clear leader in the space, can wiggle in for a piece of the pie. $BE & $FCEL are also sliding down, though this appears to be slowing down, primed for a sharp reversal.

TL;DR: Hydrogen is a key part of the global transition to green/clean energy. Will it outshine EV/ICE cars? Fuck no, but it doesn‚Äôt need to make a metric fuck ton of money. $PLUG is the clear leader in the hydrogen space, and their lead will continue to grow.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice. This is my DD that I am choosing to share to simply spark a conversation and share my own personal thoughts for others to poke a hole in in case I overlook something. I am long $PLUG via 1k shares and given today‚Äôs market slide, should it continue, I‚Äôll be converting some of my holdings to LEAPS dating Jan 2023.

There is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.

**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**

Nikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.

But Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries.

I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/17/2020) at $32.43 while RIDE is at $24.74. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.

**What makes them different**

Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).

**What does your crystal ball tell you?**

Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.

**Catalysts**

March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.

April - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)

Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.

September The beginning of live production.

**Price targets**

Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.

**Positions**

600 shares averaged at $22.40  (increased 300 shares since I first tried posting)

5 04/16/2021 $25 calls (I removed the short side because I'm dumb)

**TLDR**: ***Looking at these three side-by-side, PSLV is the safest bet (close-ended, backed by Mint of Canada, language guarantees ALL risk) and SLV seems to stand out like a sore üçå (open-ended, limited right of inspection, unlimited storage locations, backed by JPMorgan, LIABILITY LIMITATION to Trustee ONLY!?)***

In $SLV, the inspection and liability are both *severely limited*, while allocated storage location is *unlimited*. Basically, there is absolutely *zero oversight* for non-Authorized Participant shareholders holding <50k blocks (or just regular participants holding >50k for that matter). Further, this is the only ETF that has this weird clause whereby Custodian is only responsible to the Trustee (even SIVR with the SAME Trustee AND Custodian has more reasonable language for loss suffered).

I keep hearing this ""conspiracy theory"" that SLV is printed paper being false, merely because JPMorgan is too-big-to-fail and too-scrutinized. You mean that they can't possibly [spoof trades](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html) right? But if they can do that with a wrist-slap, what's stopping them from also spoofing paper, when they can just say the bullion they're keeping is on Mars and temporarily out of reach? You have no right to inspect anyway, unless you're the former-JP shill now at the SEC.

So how could they get caught short of a whistleblower? And if that happens, how would this work out in practice if SLV busts, leading to a SLV ETF run on the bank scenario or liquidation?

Would this structure actually insulate the Custodian from a law suit / fiduciary duty to shareholders? Is Trustee the only party that can recover, and shareholders thereby recover from Trustee but they would have to prove another layer of negligence? Maybe an SEC lawyer or intern can answer this. But I can't be the only person thinking this doesn't look right.",2021-02-18 06:20:17

Nothing has changed with Tesla other than two more giga-factories coming online this year and possibly launching the very first Semis along with the Cybertruck. Not only that, Tesla will potentially produce more vehicles in 2021 than over the entire life of Tesla.

Palantir: (insert provocative title),49,lm28ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm28ia/palantir_insert_provocative_title/,40,1613618210.0,"Bit unstable for the short term as Palantir still needs to endure the Lockup which will land some finishing blows against the price. But afterwards, once PLTR can establish a strong support (eyeing $30) and stabilizes, it looks ready to go.

The MM snuffed whatever we had of our initial Reversals. They got what they wanted. They brought us to a price they think we're worth. Yet we're still vastly above the PT's from the autistic Analysts and even our limbo at sub $27; which should be very indicative of how strong the Longs are for this stock. They'll still exist ofc. The resentment from how Palantir opened will probably never fully waver, especially when we start to really recover our gains.

But after the last Catalyst (Lockup), we should start finally moving like a real stock, which is honestly great. And to affirm this positive, you got to look at our opposers. When you dissect them carefully, you start to see that the opposition is greatly crippled, abandoned, and indifferent.

Anyone who was in it for the blitz is gone; they cashed out. The late to the party WSB residue, the ""bag holders"", are all gone; if not from the initial plunge, then the one following ER. The majority of the myopic Bears/Shorters who were cashing in from the manipulated plunges have been dropping off as all they got left to ride on for them to not get the debt rocket up the ass is the Lockup. The former plunge we had ended recently. After that? Yeah, let those who remain explain why PLTR is a $17 stock lmao. Because the MM killed off all the long standing hype - and volatility - this should mean less action on their ends as we start to stabilize. Palantir overtime have been wonderfully justifying why their technology is the future and that their valuation is misleading when you look at the moves they've been making since.

Remember, the reason why we were held down beforehand was because we were ""overvalued"" and the hate was entrenched when they looked at the rate our price skyrocketed; which they thought was anything but realistic. Why do you think we were in limbo for literally 2 months before the consolidation broke and we got pumped to the 40's; where preceding it we literally tripled in such little time? Palantir has been left to die by the MM on many occasions. We've managed to endure the onslaught and - as said - they should ease up when we become ""normal"". Meaning, that every minor Catalyst, every miniscule Win we get should really stick from then on. They should matter, have oomph, value.

In their prime phase of Palantir price fuckery, look at how our #'s were traded when they signed a contract for example; big Catalysts/Wins in every regard. With no euphemisms, how the pricing adjusted was literal bullshit to the max. How PLTR's pricing adjusted over a few days from each news report was not natural at all from just regular traders. It was fucking rigged un-human; but certainly algorithmic, controlled. Most of these supposed boons had zero effect. Whilst the few that had some significance like the IBM deal helped -and in that context - it assisted the reversal from $30.50, it turns out that it wasn't worth anything as PLTR reversed the reversal just days after it was discovered.

This warped control over everything was beyond rampant. How about the times we hit a certain # and despite the momentum had in the day, suddenly it all just disappears. The positive volume disappears and it just gradually plummets. Not a blitz down because it was a major sell off. Gradual. For example, look at the day after when we hit our ATH. It had a super Bull run from $39. Everyone wanted to be back in promise land. Just look at what it did right after we touched $42. No words really...

That... Is what we're going to get away from. And if you ask me, that is the biggest positive that this stock can possibly have. To me, this exceeds what just about any/all possible impetuses can do for it.

Overall, the faster we can disassociate from the algorithmic, manipulated drops/ WSB pumps, the better. And if we managed to shed the GME/Meme Stonk label with such haste, then we should be plush.

Palantirians/Palantards, enjoy the ride.

&#x200B;

P.S: I initially had 2 $30 (OTM) Calls I bought on 1/15, lasting to 2/19, sold last Friday. It was trading at $26.50 and that was when Cathie got 500k shares. It countered the only negative to me about getting in; bad Analyst consensus.

I've yet to re-establish a position, I'm waiting for the right time. The Lockup is near guaranteed to deal a massive blow to the price and obviously, I want to get in as cheap as possible. So I'm eyeing that for sure as a possible entry point; best discount I see. But overall, I'm mostly waiting for what happens post Lockup; where is its support and how will the price stabilize afterward; as I mentioned in the post. But when I do hypothetically see the right time, I'm going Long OTM Calls that last for the entirety of 2021. The strike will tbd, but I'm eyeing a $50 strike; or a little lower to be a bit safer, although I'm very Bullish on possible PT's.

Archer, a leader in the Urban Air Mobility (‚ÄúUAM‚Äù) space commercializing electric vertical takeoff and landing (‚ÄúeVTOL‚Äù) aircraft, has entered into a business combination agreement with Atlas Crest Investment Corp. (NYSE: ACIC); the newly combined company will be listed on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol ‚ÄúACHR.‚Äù
The business combination agreement is expected to provide approximately $1.1 billion of gross proceeds to the combined company, assuming minimal redemptions, to fund expected future growth, including a fully committed $600 million common stock PIPE with participation from leading strategic and financial investors including United Airlines, Stellantis and the venture arm of Exor, Baron Capital Group, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, Mubadala Capital, Putnam Investments and Access Industries. Additionally Ken Moelis and affiliates, along with Marc Lore, are investing $30 million in the PIPE.
Pro forma equity value of the merger is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion at the $10.00 per share PIPE price.
Archer has also signed an aircraft purchase agreement and collaboration agreement with United Airlines as part of the company‚Äôs commitment to decarbonization.


To put it in perspective, ALPP has 40m revenues and is over 1b evaluation while Archer has 900m in 2018

I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúXRX, a dated and otherwise antiquated printing company that‚Äôs sold at Office Max to boomers‚Äù. Let me explain why that is no longer and will no longer be their company or business model. This also is not a ‚ÄúTeSlA iS NoT a Car COmpAny‚Äù... they are very much still and will remain an office supplies and office infrastructure company. It‚Äôs more an evolution regarding execution and forward thinking implementations coupled with strong management that‚Äôs been time tested.

Let‚Äôs begin with this excerpt from their most recent 8-K posted on 1/26/21:

‚ÄúThe Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) has been central in advancing the company‚Äôs innovation portfolio including 3D Printing and Digital Manufacturing, IoT Sensors and Services, and Clean Technology. Xerox installed its first 3D printer for a client in December, and IoT solutions are at work with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other clients.‚Äù

And then let‚Äôs use PRNT by Ark Investments as a canvas for observing 3-D printing, and IoT printing as a future prospect. Also, PRNT gives us an idea of the market's ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù for pricing these assets.

PRNT

**1 Month** 7.92%

**3 Months** 31.45%

**YTD** 40.18%

**1 Year\*** 40.18%

**3 Years** 9.22%

**Since Inception** 11.47%

\*Take the 1YR performance with a grain of salt as the **broad market is up roughly \~30%...**

Look who‚Äôs in PRNT‚Äôs holdings ‚ÄúXEROX HOLDINGS CORP XRX UN 30,338 shares 726,595 mkt price‚Äù taken from PRNT‚Äôs holdings‚Ä¶ linked here [https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/THE\_3D\_PRINTING\_ETF\_PRNT\_HOLDINGS.pdf](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/THE_3D_PRINTING_ETF_PRNT_HOLDINGS.pdf)

It‚Äôs clear that we are dealing with a company that is primed and ready to make a claim on the 3-D printing, and IoT for office. Given their infrastructure already in place from being a legacy brand with legacy clients... I firmly believe they will capitalize on the market.

Lastly, and this is the kicker, Carl Ichan has recently up‚Äôd his stake in the company. He is building a long position and I frankly have no problem riding with him.

Nektar (NKTR): Short Squeeze Candidate with Long Term Fundamental Value,5,lm1690,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm1690/nektar_nktr_short_squeeze_candidate_with_long/,33,1613615392.0,"I actually tried to post this last week, but the spam filters took it down. I am reposting it because we have confirmation today with a 10% move up, hopefully it posts this time because there is still a lot of room in this stock.

Summary:

* NKTR has recently broken out of long-term consolidation at its lows with bullish daily price action.
* With 24 million shares sold short and 98% owned by institutions, there are very few shares available to be bought in the market. Hedge funds who are short this stock will be quickly underwater if this short squeeze gains steam. Given the recent highly visible short squeezes, there will be a rush toward the exits for hedge funds as the squeeze gains momentum.
* While NKTR will not make money until one of its many drug candidates reach the market, it has zero debt and $1B in cash. The company is in a strong financial position and its blockbuster drug for melanoma (Bempegaldesleukin) is in final Phase 3 trials. At a $3.5B market cap it is currently extremely undervalued.

NKTR has recently broken out of long-term consolidation:

[ As you can see by the daily chart, NKTR has recently climbed above its long term moving averages on convincing price action. The last time this happened in 2017, the stock quickly ran up to 100. ](https://preview.redd.it/c8y9b7ibz2i61.png?width=2709&format=png&auto=webp&s=db9baeba43b81d20c367a490bb3edbac3713615b)

 Hedge funds who are short this stock will be quickly underwater if this short squeeze gains steam. 

[ Looking at the 5 minute chart for the past 2 weeks, we can see that NKTR broke out on 1\/25 and there was some quick short covering in the wake of the publicity around GME and short targeting. The hedge funds did manage to keep the stock under 25 that first week and prevent a gamma squeeze. The stock is now flirting with closing over 25 with today's move. If it does, the short squeeze will quickly gain momentum and 100+ is a very reasonable price target](https://preview.redd.it/oiz51c2jz2i61.png?width=2030&format=png&auto=webp&s=09e8189f045fffd444c63c6f84410da6d56f364d)

NKTR is in a strong financial position and its blockbuster drug for melanoma (Bempegaldesleukin) is in final Phase 3 trials.

The data regarding Bempegaldesleukin is too dense to discuss here completely but just to give a few numbers, the most recent update in November 2020 saw a 53% overall response rate and 34% complete response rate at 18 months for melanoma. This is an amazing result!

As melanoma is one of the world‚Äôs most common cancers, the drug has all the makings of a blockbuster. Even ignoring the immediate short squeeze opportunity, NKTR is extremely undervalued based on this alone and is a very viable long-term investment candidate.

In addition to Bempeg, there are several other drugs in the pipeline for indications including Non-Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphoma, Atopic Dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis and Lupus. Any number of these drugs could be blockbusters in their own right as these are all also very common diseases. The NKTR pipeline is one of the most potentially lucrative pipelines in all of biotech.

In summary, there is an immediate short squeeze trade opportunity in NKTR as well as a longer term investment play.

I welcome any thoughts!

Hello ape! ü¶ç Come closer don't be afraid... Have you been anally violated in the great BANG war??($BB,AMC,NOK,GME) Did Melvin and his bros steal tendies from you? Are you desperately looking for another play after being violated in all the wrong places???

$aaaAYTU am looking for the next play after getting fucked with my $GME position!

**Background: When $BB was undervalued, I wrote a good** [**DD(click me)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) **preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!**

**A retard like you will go directly to the TLDR,** but a normal person might ask, What is $aaaAYTU? aaaAytu BioScience is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel treatments by acquiring or licensing approved, commercialized products and late-stage development therapeutics. They bring these novel and needed treatments to the market of millions of patients who desperately need them. **In Ape language(plagiarized):** It is an unconventional biotech company, which acquires licenses for new drugs/tech they think will massively disrupt the medical sector and they help bring these products to the market.

An example of what they have right now: **COVID-19** lgG/lgM Rapid Test, **NATESTO**(nasal gel, the only FDA-approved nasally administered testosterone indicated for replacement therapy in adult males with a deficiency), **ZOLPIMIST**(DA-approved oral spray zolpidem product indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation.), **KARBINAL**(indicated to treat various allergic conditions including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and other common allergic conditions.), **TUZISTRA**(is the only codeine-based extended-release oral suspension cough-cold treatment in the US prescription cough-cold market.), and others you can check out later.

**(** üöÄ **massive catalyst** üöÄ **) A novel treatment they are working on** which they accidentally stumbled on, like most scientific innovations. The treatment is using UV light as an antimicrobial(against viruses and bacteria) therapy in humans. Moreover, Orange man has mentioned using UV light to treat COVID patients a few months back. It's potentially a safe and effective approach of treating internal organs by using UV light against Microbes. **(How it works)** UV light kills viruses(such as COVID) and bacteria, but it's harmful to humans. they got around that by filtering the UV light from UVB(dangerous) and using only UVA(safe). They plan to insert it to the body through an endotracheal tube(throat tube) which has an LED emitter. If it gets an FDA approval, it would be ground breaking.

**Recent news?** a few days ago, they had their first earnings of the year and they beat revenue expectations BY **2.9$Million!!! with lots of spare cash.** In addition, they announced that soon they will merge with $NEOS(100M revenue).

Now you might wonder, with all of what I mentioned, this must be a billion dollar company right? Wrong!!!! it shockingly has a market cap of **only 147million!!!** making it **massively undervalued** in my opinion.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ My Price target is: The moon 20$  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üåï

**TLDR:**

**1- Massively undervalued stock. (this is an understatement) ‚úÖ**

**2- It has a great product line with a massive cash reserve. ‚úÖ**

**3- It's working on a new type of treatment which could disrupt the industry. ‚úÖ**

**4- It does not have options. (MM's will not fuck with the price on a weekly basis to steal premiums) ‚úÖ**

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, I‚Äôll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I‚Äôll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don‚Äôt believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck ‚Äúdiamond handing‚Äù, I‚Äôm **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I‚Äôm trading GME.

# Important External Reading

These three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Here‚Äôs some history on GME that‚Äôs worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME‚Äôs share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It‚Äôs very likely GME was shorted out of the S&P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCC‚Äôs actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood‚Äôs head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood‚Äôs users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a ‚Äúturn off buying or else‚Äù kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn‚Äôt care about shooting down Robinhood. It‚Äôs a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you‚Äôd know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there‚Äôs **high trading volume relative to total float**, it‚Äôs easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That‚Äôs why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasn‚Äôt just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It‚Äôs very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, we‚Äôre back to a value play. GME‚Äôs market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we‚Äôre not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He‚Äôs likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he‚Äôs going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen‚Äôs 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** It‚Äôs really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it‚Äôs unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn‚Äôt realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood‚Äôs instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How I‚Äôm thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **I‚Äôve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can‚Äôt wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn‚Äôt bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I‚Äôm slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of ‚ÄúGME is another blockbuster destined for death‚Äù is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don‚Äôt think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, I‚Äôm hoping for a further dip. I‚Äôm **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Here‚Äôs some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that‚Äôs a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I‚Äôm selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don‚Äôt sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of ‚Äúpennies in front of a steamroller‚Äù but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt go tits up‚Äù.
      * ‚ÄúDownside‚Äù risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don‚Äôt fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don‚Äôt pay you for it, margin call you when you‚Äôre winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúfree‚Äù commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; don‚Äôt maximise profitability.** I sold some shares ‚Äúearly‚Äù on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for ‚Äúmaximum profit‚Äù led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don‚Äôt sell on dips.** You‚Äôre only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it‚Äôs heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I‚Äôm holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I‚Äôd love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME‚Äôs price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?

5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME

6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?

## Dear Plumpkin,

1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity

2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back

3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt

4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th

5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital

6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?

7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?

8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME

9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise

10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-""R""-T when they closed their short gme positions

11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?

12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?",2021-02-18 04:12:49

Don't be dumb, Trivago isn't going to 20.00 in the next month. 4.50 is a healthy gain from the 2.80 price when the initial DD was posted.

Also, for those interested. Selling some March 35.00 and 40.00 puts for purple is a good opportunity based on the large pullback we have had this week.

$CHK Chesapeak Energy. Cheapest billion dollar equity cap idea out there. Just came out of BK,12,lm0lqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm0lqv/chk_chesapeak_energy_cheapest_billion_dollar/,43,1613613922.0,"DO YOUR OWN DAMNED DUE DILIGENCE.

I am not a financial advisor.

I definitely like this stock and own it personally. I will buy more, I will sell it, I will do whatever I want with it.

IMO it is the cheapest > 1bn dollar equity cap idea in the market today.

Chesapeake energy emerged from bankruptcy (‚ÄúBK‚Äù) a couple of days ago. Chesapeake is one of the largest independent gas producers in the United States. The company has been completely transformed during the BK process; it has barely any debt left for a Co. its size and has reduced cash costs by almost 50%. Importantly, all of the garbage that may have been in the company would have come out to the light during the BK process and consequently has now been cleaned up.

If you don‚Äôt know how BK‚Äôs work here is a quick primer:

Super expensive BK lawyers and fin advisors are hired to guide the Co. through the BK. The company then declares bankruptcy. Management fires a bunch of people, says it can‚Äôt pay off a hell of a lot of debt, and says it can‚Äôt honor a bunch of contracts. The different classes of debt holders have their own financial advisors and lawyers that the Co is likely also on the hook for battling it out to try to screw holders out of what the company owed them so that they can end up with a bigger portion of whatever remains. The BK court approves all of these moves to give the entire proceeding an aura of legitimacy as opposed to showing the battle royal that it is. In the background, BK lawyers and fin advisors are paying themselves a ridiculous amount of fees which once approved by the court can‚Äôt be challenged and most importantly management is restructuring its compensation package.

Since management wants subsequent shareholders to believe that they are doing a good job they provide a set of projections alongside the restructuring advisors that an 18 year old with a gardening degree could beat. The point of this is to have the options package that they (management) receive kick in at the lowest possible valuation and thereby have the highest possible compensation for themselves down the line. Pretty nice gig if you can get it.

On the topic of management teams, the geniuses at CHK made sure to hedge 80 pct of 2021 production at around 42 bucks a barrel. Oil is at 60. Had they done NOTHING with their ‚Äúhedging‚Äù, into which I am sure they put in a hell of a lot of thought, revenues would be 40 pct higher, but hey that is why they have worked in the oil industry for decades and get paid the big bucks. Fortunately, they have not hedged too much of 2022 production and that is where the juice is. This sets the company up for a mediocre 2021 and a great 2022 at current gas and oil prices. This should set up management beautifully too.

So, to summarize how we got here. The first lien debt holders used the chaos caused by negative 40 dollar oil market to take away the company from the other debt holders. Now that the world is not over despite politicians‚Äô best efforts; people still need energy. Nat gas in the Midwest is up 30 times in a week. Germany is importing energy because windmills can‚Äôt produce enough. Maybe just maybe 2021 will not mark the end of fossil fuels.

\*\*\*\*\* In LTMQ3 2020 CHK made 1.44 billion in adjusted EBITDA. That was with gas 11 pct lower and costs 50 pct higher. If you assume 20 pct lower production in 2022, current gas prices and current costs you get 1.66 billion in adjusted EBITDA assuming no changes in assets and liabilities, no other revenue, 100 mln in interest expense, and 10 million in other items.  (I have taken a lot of liberties in these projections)

I believe that the Co. deserves a much higher multiple than it used to have as everyone has known for YEARS that it was under threat of going BK due to high leverage.

The stock is very illiquid and as soon as volumes pick up expect a lot of selling from term loan holders (people that went through the restructuring) that will be selling their positions.",2021-02-18 04:05:22
My FUBO DD and why bears are fucked,37,lm0ijn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm0ijn/my_fubo_dd_and_why_bears_are_fucked/,16,1613613702.0,"$FUBO [https://www.fubo.tv/welcome](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome)

 **FuboTV is** an American [streaming television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television) service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including [NFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League), [MLB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball), [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association), [NHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League), [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies 

&#x200B;

**Cord Cutting -** Nearly all Americans aged 25-34 prefer to access media content via the internet instead of cable. Cable and Satellite subscriptions are plummeting, Both AT&T and Comcast have lost over 100k subscribers this last year. There are approximately 40 million Cord Cutters and the projection is that number will grow to 55million by the end of 2021. Mind you these numbers are ONLY FOR THE USA! Read more here: [https://techjury.net/blog/cord-cutting-statistics/#gref](https://techjury.net/blog/cord-cutting-statistics/#gref)

Think about this world-wide, in countries that don't have fiber optic running to every house on the block and require 7 satellites just to watch a soccer game. Which, brings me to point number 2. 

&#x200B;

**Live Sports.** 

FUBO offers 50+ live TV channels, but in addition, offers a plethora of live sporting events. Soccer, Baseball, Football, etc. This is a major draw for many who only have cable to watch their favorite teams. 

In December it was announced that FUBO is planning to offer exclusive sporting events. Think PPV events only for FUBO subscribers. The bigger they grow, the bigger events they can pull in.

[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/358901/fubotv-mulls-exclusive-live-sports-and-sports-wage.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/358901/fubotv-mulls-exclusive-live-sports-and-sports-wage.html)

&#x200B;

**Subscribers**

There are over 500,000 subscribers to FUBO. To put this in perspective HULU plus and You Tube TV, both have 3million+. So there is plenty of room for growth. The FUBO price tag is comparable to HULU and YouTube TV. As you can see, they offer nearly identical offerings for the price, but their edge is international soccer.

&#x200B;

**Sports Gambling**  
FUBO is developing its own sportsbook. With more states in extreme debt due to Covid19, they have no choice but to begin legalizing sports gambling which has been very beneficial in the few states that already allow it. Imagine being able to place live bets on your TV while watching the game. Will Patrick Mahomes throw a TD on the next drive? Bet now for +115 odds. As a gambling junkie, I'd be interested in this myself.

**Institutional Buying**

As I have been learning, you need to follow the money. There have been 6 13G's filed in the last week! 6!   [https://sec.report/Ticker/FUBO](https://sec.report/Ticker/FUBO)

&#x200B;

**FinTwit/Twitter**

Mr. Zack Morris has been pumping this up on Twitter for the past week. He has over 400k followers and the ticker has been trending on FinTwit for a week or so. Retail investors are in. 

https://twitter.com/MrZackMorris   


**High Short Interest:**

FUBO has a 23% Short Interest and had a bit of a squeeze earlier this year when the price went from $20-$60. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

&#x200B;

**Earnings**

This is the catalyst. Earnings are coming out on March 2nd after the close. They whiffed big time on their last earnings report, but due to all the institutional buying, the Disney, and Comcast ownership, I'm inclined to think this report will be different. 

This could squeeze to ATH $70!

**Yes, there is a US company with assets of $63 trillion that you haven't heard about.** That's a problem. And it's time this company that's relevant to the $GME scandal testify to Congress. The People demand to know if the system is working fairly for all.

**Their name:** The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (""DTCC""). *See* [*https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance). **They claim the ""\[t\]otal value of active issues held at DTCC"" in 2019 was $63 trillion.** Simply put, they hold your stocks. That year, they settled $120.80 trillion in securities transactions alone.

**What do they do**: Not much - other than **settle almost every securities transaction in the United States.** In an SEC Sample Offering Document, DTCC claims themselves to be ""the world's largest securities depository."" *See* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995\_ex10-3.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995_ex10-3.htm).

**Why DTCC matters**: Robinhood relies on their subsidiary, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (""NSCC""), to help clear their trades. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/). Here's a good explanation of what they do: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/).

In a document on the US Treasury's website, it states the DTCC's shareholders are many banks:

""DTCC is a holding company of DTC, FICC and NSCC, which are independent legal subsidiaries. There is a single governance structure for the three clearing agencies. DTCC governance arrangements are available publicly and updated on a yearly basis (last update October 2009). **DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks, brokerdealers, mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC‚Äôs clearing agency subsidiaries, including NSCC.""** *See* [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP\_DAR\_Settlements\_NSCC\_Final\_5%2011%2010.pdf](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP_DAR_Settlements_NSCC_Final_5%2011%2010.pdf).

Let's get this straight, the shareholders of DTCC are the banks? They govern a $63 trillion company (in terms of asset worth, not valuation (come on, people, I know the difference)), by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on? **How is this not a conflict of interest to the integrity of the free markets?**

To be clear, I don't know who these banks are. Can't find them. That seems *interesting*. One internet article claims ""DTCC‚Äôs user-owners include: Citigroup, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Virtu, Barclays . . . Mellon, Bank of America."" *See* [https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing](https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing). I couldn't verify this.

Better yet, read this email by Murray Pozmanter, the Managing Director - Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC, dated Feb. 1, 2019. First, he states that ""DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U.S. cash market securities CCPs, National Securities Clearing Corporation (‚ÄúEn Es C C (prevent auto-ban) ‚Äù)."" Yes, the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) that runs Robinhood's clearing work. Second, he states that ""**The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks, broker dealers, and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC‚Äôs SIFMU subsidiaries, and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non-participant directors.** Importantly, our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability, which is especially critical during times of crisis."" *See* [https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf).

**It just gets worse.** Back in the late 2000's, DTCC was sued for facilitating naked short selling. *See* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720). *Does this, uh, sound familiar?*

DTCC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit, arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue. There appears to be an archived article stating DTCC's response to the accusation back in 2007:

""As DTCC has explained, short-selling and naked short selling are trading strategies.¬† These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces/exchanges, the self-regulatory organizations and the SEC.¬† **DTCC is involved in post-trade processing, which occurs after a trade is completed.¬† DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity.¬† In fact, as we told the WSJ reporters, we have no power to force the closing of an open fail, no matter what the cause, and we do not have the authority to force a buy-in**.""

They also stated that: ""**Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets**.¬† The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market."" *See* [*https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj\_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3). Boy, would I love the freedom to buy a stock I want, even if Hedge Funds mess up and nakedly over-short a position during a squeeze!

The SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational/transfer issues of a stock or fraud called ""chills"" or ""freezes."" *See* [https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib\_dtcfreezes.html](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_dtcfreezes.html). *But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly-shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit?*

**Let's also get this straight**: back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in **pre-trading**. Only post. So what the hell happened this month with En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) and Robinhood then? Congress, are you listening? ¬†

**Why this matters**: Recently, Robinhood's CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, an app where Musk interviews guests. It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban), the DTCC subsidiary, to post $3 billion of capital at 3 a.m. in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy. I'll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here:

8:55 (Musk): Who controls those organizations, those clearing houses?

9:02 (Vlad): \[Awkward pause\] Um . . . you know . . . it's a consortium. It's not quite a government agency. You know . . . **I don't really know the details of all that.**

9:15 (Musk): OK . . .

9:16 (Vlad): But, you know, and to be fair, we were . . . we were . . . uh . . . I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets. Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity, so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it's not entirely unreasonable.""

**\*\*Now square this with Vlad's earlier comments during the interview:\*\***

4:02 (Vlad): The request was around $3 billion dollars. Um, which is, an order of magnitude of what it typically is. Right so, um.

4:17 (Musk): This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital. **What formula did they use to calculate that?**

4:25 (Vlad): Well, um, yeah, just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised, uh, you know a little bit around $2 billion in total venture capital up until now. So, it's a big number. Like $2 billion dollars is a large number right. **So, um, basically, the, and, you know, and I, the details are, we don't have the full details**, it's a little bit of an opaque formula but there's a component called the ""VAR"" of it, which is ""Value at Risk"" and, um, that's based on some fairly quantitative things although it's not fully transparent, but it's not kind of publicly shared. So, uh, there are ways to reverse engineer it but it's not kind of publicly shared. **And then there's a special component that's discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier.** And, um, basically . . .

5:24 (Musk): Discretionary, like meaning it is just their **opinion**.

5:29 (Vlad): **Yeah**, there, uh, it's a little bit, I mean I'm sure there's something definitely more than just their opinion.

The full interview is available on YouTube. Search: ""Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse."" Can't post the link.

**\*\*Breakdown:\*\***

Vlad is asked by this ""consortium"" to post $3 billion, 150% of Robinhood's entire venture capital amount, at three in the morning, or presumably, trading will not be cleared. However, Vlad doesn't ""really know the details"" of this ""consortium,"" but decides it's a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway. Moreover, this so called ""consortium"" apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to. I guess every reasonable CEO posts almost a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn't really know too much about (around $700 million to be exact). *Yes, the figure was later negotiated down.*

Further, this ""discretionary"" posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood's explanation to clients:

""**How do clearinghouses determine how much is required?**

It‚Äôs pretty technical, but the process basically works as follows: clearinghouses look at a firm‚Äôs customer holdings as a portfolio. They use a volatility multiplier, looking at specific stocks, to quantify their risk."" *See* [https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week).

I mean, man, is it really ""technical"" if the capital requirement can also be an ""opinion,"" that is, discretionary? That was conveniently *left out*. The fact is this: Vlad said one thing but *omitted* another. **Why.**

**TLDR/ The Rub:** What is Big Money? It's $63 fucking trillion dollars. The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy. The point is to expose an **apparent** ***conflict of interest*** and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence. If you're going to take away the People's literal ""buy button,"" the People better have a right to know why. **Don't pull a fast one on the working people at 3 a.m. in the morning.**

Tesla will buy GE. Tesla will be a direct competitor with Boeing and Airbus while capturing 25% of the market. GE will remain under pressure despite recent gains and Tesla will continue at a beautiful rate despite a few short term dips due to share offerings to generate additional capital. I predict Tesla has $50+ billion in offerings in 2021.

**Storytime**

It really grinds my gears when I see analysts pontificate about how Tesla‚Äôs market cap is bigger than all the other car companies combined. I will say it now, so these ignoramuses get it through their thick skull (and through their helmets), ‚ÄúTesla is not a car company and Elon Musk is not like Henry Ford‚Äù. Here is the actual comparison you need to know and allow to be burned into your skull:

Elon Musk is the modern day Thomas Edison (and I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Elon to electrocute an elephant to put people on Mars)

If anyone knows the history of Edison, he wasn‚Äôt so much an inventor as he was a main of industry, optimizing, building and yes, inventing along the way. I urge all my tri-state autists to venture to West Orange, NJ and visit the Thomas Edison National Park. - [Thomas Edison National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)](https://www.nps.gov/edis/index.htm)

We are living and breathing modern history watching this brilliant kid smoke some hashish with Joe Rogan, all the while sending people to space. For anyone who can read here, I highly recommend the Ashley Vance book. For those who are actually able to procreate with someone, you‚Äôll be telling your grandkids about him 50 years from now. Although, the majority of you will never see your grandkids because the only offspring you provided were generated from your sperm bank deposits since you needed the money for GME shares. [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future: Vance, Ashlee: 9780062301253: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X)

Bottom line, Elon‚Äôs goal is simple, get to Mars because we‚Äôre going to ‚ÄúF‚Äù up this planet. In order to blast off and settle somewhere else, we need transportation and energy, of which Elon has been hyper-focused. He‚Äôs got the SpaceX thing down pretty well. He has the individual shuttling down pretty well with Tesla. The energy side of things is ready to explode as the battery technology moves into the next phase. What we haven‚Äôt seen is intercontinental travel. I‚Äôll talk about that further down.

**Why GE**

To start, it was Edison‚Äôs original company. There is nostalgia that Musk prefers to carry through and likely why he won‚Äôt move the entirety of SpaceX away from Cape Canaveral. Even though nostalgia will play a role, it isn‚Äôt enough to acquire a $95 billion market cap company. The main reason why GE is a prime target versus a Boeing is because GE is general aviation and energy, with significant downside pressure coming from years of epic failures in leadership. Musk would have been a Jack Welch fan (don‚Äôt listen to Suzy as she simply milked whatever fame should could from Jack‚Äôs teat and is now a memory at best).

But seriously, why buy a behemoth of corporate bureaucracy that hasn‚Äôt seen any substantial growth since the 90s. Well, my friends, cronyism‚Ä¶.and long term capital contracts that have tentacles into the nation‚Äôs energy complex and aviation networks. While this fireside chat won‚Äôt go into the $400 billion in annual electricity spending (US only), this would likely comprise about $100-150 billion if taken to a global level for Tesla capturing 20-30%. [table3.pdf (eia.gov)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table3.pdf)

Why lean into energy faster with GE??? Those damn Chinese. You might have seen some NIO, LI, XPEV and a multitude of others bubbling up on this channel. The infrastructure is needed to support them as well as communist overlords trying to take over the world. These overlords are doing everything they can to get the hell away from coal (not because they are hippies) because they hated wearing masks in Shanghai and Beijing when there wasn‚Äôt the Rona. Battery technology represents a long-term growth investment to reduce their overall costs and seeing they keep pulling away from the world politically, they need to be sustainable without help, not even with Russian nat gas.

Battery expansion will only accelerate the more the technology is used en masse. Given the aviation and infrastructure levels not yet tapped into, along with government budgets (works for SpaceX), these two segments are ripe for explosive growth. The biggest headwinds will be discussed with the aviation side in a sec. Needless to say, EV cars are exciting, but batteries are the single key which gets both conservatives and liberals to full chub. The militia types save money with cheaper energy and the flower child gets their green energy. By buying the rights that the GE connections have with governments, will accelerate their growth into them.

**Aviation Domination**

Everyone right now: ‚ÄúSeriously, you‚Äôre a blowhard and took forever to get to this‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúYou have a point but I don‚Äôt know how to take a vacation and still feel compelled to type out long, extraneous things in order to make myself appear smart‚Äù

Everyone: ‚ÄúThe helmet with your name on it suggests you may need to go back to playing with blocks‚Äù

I digress. Aviation, the real play here. Boeing and Airbus can suck it. Any company that has a backlog of work that spans 5-10 years, is screaming ‚ÄúI trade hookers and blow for favors from politicians and CEOs‚Äù. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the capital expense needed to manage through limited demand for highly capital intensive work is a potential for that, however, the same was said about NASA. The price to send someone to space on the shuttle was around $450-500 million. The price for SpaceX to do it, $90-150 million. When Boeing‚Äôs average plane costs $85 million on average (without any domestic competition), you know there is room for potential. Let‚Äôs break some numbers down:

*Boeing 737 Max Numbers*

Average price: $99MM (rounded) [‚Ä¢ Boeing aircraft prices 2020 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273941/prices-of-boeing-aircraft-by-type/#:~:text=The%20Boeing%20737%2D700%2C%20listed,ones%20on%20Boeing%27s%20price%20list.)

Average Zero Fuel Weight: 138K (think passengers, baggage and minimum fluids/gas)

Average Takeoff Weight: 177K [Boeing 737 Max - Modern Airliners](https://modernairliners.com/boeing-737/boeing-737-max/)

*Tesla Model 3*

Average price: $40K (rounded)

Average weight: 4.5k

Average battery weight: 1k

Assuming we are looking at a 4:1 or 5:1 total weight-to-battery weight ratio, it would carry over into 40-45 batteries of capacity. There would likely be fuel still needed for initial takeoff due to thrust concerns, as well as backup for any emergency or corrective maneuvers requiring more thrust in order to conserve battery capacity. By the time production would take place, we could anticipate even further reductions on battery weight and power output which would further extend ranges. This would equate to being able to build an airplane for under $3-5MM. Given the loss of production efficiency without a true assembly line, it would hover on the higher end of the threshold.

Between vertical integration and the sheer backlog of more than 12k planes available to capture, not to mention the projected doubling of commercial aircraft demand in the next 10 years, simply matching Boeing and Airbus production would push revenues around $35-50 billion selling the Tesla planes at half the price of Boeing. If they expanded production to capture 25% of share of production over the next 10 years, you‚Äôre looking at nearly $350 billion.

Papa Elon is planning to bring people to Mars and will require interstellar transportation beyond 2-4 people each time on the Falcon Heavy. He is likely designing transport that allows for passengers in the hundreds beyond his Starship planning. The transition of moving scalable transportation fits into the aviation front. The only thing missing at this point are wings.

*Market Potential*

Average Boeing Airplane Sale Price: $84MM

Tesla Costs (Tesla 3 Proxy with multiplier for inefficiency): $3-5MM

Tesla Airline Pricing: $50-60MM

**How the hell is he going to pay for this?**

Tesla stock will hit $1000 this year. Heck, it may even get up to $2000. My money is on the former. During the continued meteoric rise, Elon will continue to offer more shares to further build the war chest. In the event of a GE takeover, he will do what Salesforce did. He will likely retain 20-30% of the newly acquired war chest and utilize shares for the remainder. The plan would be to sell off GE Healthcare (\~$20 billion annual revenue) to a Philips or J&J and use that sale to offset a good chunk of the initial purchase. GE may hit $100 billion in market cap this year, but only because of this value shift from some of the tech sector. It will likely depress, to fall back into a trading range that isn‚Äôt overly speculative. (Not financial advice in any way, so CYA, lol)

Also, the reason why this is important, it shuts up every freaking analyst about Tesla being a car company. They can never talk about market caps for Toyota or what Hyundai is doing. It makes no sense because this stock has not traded as a car company for the past year. They need to shut up. It will put short term pressure on Tesla in the short term as is being seen with CRM and the Slack acquisition. One thing for certain, no one has come to say how stupid CRM and WORK are together, only how they are going to be a force to be reckoned with once fully integrated. While stock in the short term is finding its path, the future is going to be incredible.

**What should you do now?**

As with my other DD and hopefully future ones provided I don‚Äôt get the ban stick or I lose wifi privileges, I want to try to put things on people‚Äôs radars. Tesla looks like a buy at these levels, despite the swings we‚Äôre going to see. GE though, meh. Tesla is building a war chest, like Apple, to accelerate development, through talent and technology acquisition. I foresee the biggest acquisitions that take place next year come from those two in a race for EV dominance. The China story, while exciting the past few months, will have headwinds with regulation, national defense concerns, and a blowing wind of political appetite which is about as easy to predict as the weather tomorrow from your local meteorologist. If China wants to play nice with the US, trademark protection becomes a big issue, and XPEV is the first to get blown off their pedestal.

~~The other major catalyst is a Democratic sweep next week. While expect some pull back on a Republican win for both, either scenario will push things higher, but a Democratic sweep is not fully priced in.~~ Additionally, any significant spike in oil prices this year (a second recession will keep them lower) will further propel EVs in the spotlight. Imagine the EV conversation with $100 barrels of oil. I am still surprised how powerful it has been at $40.

There will be a moment this year that Tesla‚Äôs focus moves beyond cars in the public forum. The only way for them to continue this growth trajectory given the competitive forces popping up are to attack competitors that think they have a monopoly. Ask Lockheed and Northrup Grumman how they‚Äôre feeling about their margins in the past couple of years since SpaceX came. The same is going to happen with Aviation (and potentially electrical grid competitors such as Nextera and PSEG.

And if Tesla does get into aviation, Boeing and Airbus are going to be under heavy pressure. The airlines would likely benefit heavily, but that would not be truly realized for a few years as infrastructure planning and adoption will take time.

Cheers gents (and ladies)!

I have been in RKT for about  a month now. The action reminds me a lot of GME around Oct/Nov time frame.

I plan on playing RKT at least until housing starts slowing down.

Cons: If interest rates sky rocket then RKT will get hit.

"Volatility play Flow Traders NV AMS: FLOW DD, highy undervalued.",14,llxny1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llxny1/volatility_play_flow_traders_nv_ams_flow_dd_highy/,6,1613606378.0,"  

With markets at an all-time high, not going in to any details weather this justified or not, it is unprecedented that volatility is stil super high. Here comes Flow Traders. 

&#x200B;

**What is Flow traders business?** 

Description on there website: 

*As a technology company operating in a financial environment, we use our principal technology platform to quote bid and ask prices in thousand of ETP listings, as well as similar financial products. We also provide liquidity to institutional counterparties off-exchange across all regions: the Americas, APAC and AMEA. Market participants benefit from higher execution quality and lower overall trading costs, while the market benefit form greater efficiency and more transparency.*

**Basically they make money by high speed trading. The buy and sell really quicky in the event of an price change. An easy example, imagine you(Flow Traders) are at a farmers market, looking to buy apples. There are two different farmers selling the same apples. One farmer changes his price upwards, because the harvest was disappointing. So you go really fast to the other lower priced farmer and buy a ton of apples and sell them to the higher priced farmer. You do this until the price is the same at both stands.** 

**Why is this interesting?** 

Volatility is there best friend. The more the price changes the more they can profit. That‚Äôs why when the market went down in march, volatility of course increased, and their stock/profit went up almost inversely to the stock market. But I hear yourself thinking the market has never been this high. And historically speaking the volatility should be declining. In comes the following graph: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f9os3d3x72i61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c83d06481f0344f1877f5469d839192a5aa2cb9

&#x200B;

**As you can see the volatility is still abnormally high, this not normal for an healthy stock market. But that‚Äôs an discussion for**  **another time.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/07r6rzfy72i61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=990e342142b1cdb656aeeafbc8c88dabb3e17d15

As you can see the stock price perfectly correlates with the volatility graph above. Volatility goes up flow traders goes up. In my opinion volatility is only going to increase in the upcoming years. With the big inflow of retail traders and highly anticipated market correction. 

**Let‚Äôs talk financials**

As you can see flow traders has already steadily increased in the past couple months. As more and more investors see the potential. But if you look at there financials there is still tremendous room for growth: 

**Market Cap: 1.5B**  
 **PE Ratio: 3.44** 

https://preview.redd.it/s8t1d77382i61.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=3494e659d8a2e95966dc0a5e0d03b13a9c527030

They absolutely crushed 2020 with there cost only increasing 8%. They made almost 500 million in net profit with only a market cap of 1.5B. 

**Insider buying**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e9z6cqc682i61.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e058ea7cb2a8ba50e7ea4d5e8d4bfbe8a35f2de

A lot of shares are held by insiders. Moreover recently there were insiders buying more shares (I will put a link down below). This is always a good indicator. 

**Conclusion**

This is still pure speculation as to whether the volatility increases or decreases in the upcoming years. In my personal opinion volatility isn‚Äôt going anywhere with recent and upcoming macroeconomics uncertainty. But that‚Äôs for you to decide. Furthermore, if I‚Äôm wrong and the volatility decrease, this company is still very much undervalued looking at the financials. So that‚Äôs why for me this a long term hold. 

Looking forward to your replies and possible corrections on my DD. 

**TLDR: A volatility play. Flow Trades profit(a lot!) form the high recent and possibly upcoming volatility. Furthermore, this is an excellent market hedge.**

"About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.",18971,llxbg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llxbg0/about_21_million_gamestop_shares_failedtodeliver/,699,1613605456.0,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html

SEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver
(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.

More than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.

The SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer‚Äôs shares.

GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.

While the SEC‚Äôs list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it‚Äôs evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.

Short sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren‚Äôt known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.

‚ÄúFails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,‚Äù reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. ‚ÄúTherefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‚Äònaked‚Äô short selling.‚Äù

Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there‚Äôs also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.

One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn‚Äôt be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop‚Äôs shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.

The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a ‚Äúcumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,‚Äù according to the SEC‚Äôs website.

About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.",2021-02-18 01:44:16

There's a lot of talk about residential standby generators right now. I work for a large apartment management company in Dallas and for the first time I'm hearing talk of standby generators for apartment complexes. We have entire complexes where the residents are sleeping inside their running cars for heat after days without power. We also have had major flooding issues in our newer communities from frozen pipes bursting. 

I see a decent play with the major standby generator producers. Here goes: 

GNRC - Generac Holdings, Inc. - the largest US producer of residential standby generators which are primarily sold through Home Depot. 

CMI - Cummins Inc - larger player in the commercial standby generator game. 

I also mention CAT but they seem to be geared more towards heavy industry, data center type standby set ups.

**3D Printing Technology and its enormous potential**

Everyone who has worked with 3D printing technology before knows it is fascinating and it can do marvellous things. Recently, we have seen companies printing [medical equipment](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/3d-printing-service/3d-printing-medical-equipment-response-covid-19-pandemic) to tackle the Covid-19 crisis. In October 2020, the first [entire residential building](https://www.archdaily.com/949531/3d-printing-for-residential-is-market-ready-germanys-first-building-is-under-construction) has gone under construction with 3D printing technology in Germany, requiring close to no building site workers. Airbus has recently presented a [3D-printed aircraft prototype](https://phys.org/news/2016-06-airbus-3d-printed-mini-aircraft.html). According to them 3D-printing will make aircrafts 30-50 percent lighter, while making them faster and save fuel.

3D printing can be used with all sorts of materials ‚Äì **plastics, sands, even metals**. The technology is more efficient with factory space and human resources than traditional machines. Layer-by-layer production results in no material waste compared to other technologies. It is run with electricity and can be **CO2-free** in the future.

It is likely that every single sector in the industry will benefit from the technology. In medicine, it can used to print protheses, equipment or teeth replacements and in the future even [organ replacements](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/on-the-road-to-3-d-printed-organs-67187) might be possible. The weapon industry has started to [craft weapons using 3D printing](https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printed-gun-firearm-weapon-parts/). [Adidas has recently started 3D printing shoes reducing the production time by 1 week](https://theconversation.com/3d-printed-sports-shoes-are-more-about-your-wallet-than-your-feet-82287). There are many more examples but you get the point.

We are about to experience a second and even more powerful industrial revolution. However, as of now, **[only 1% of the global manufacturing market utilizes 3D printing](https://amfg.ai/2020/01/14/40-3d-printing-industry-stats-you-should-know-2020-redirect/)**, leaving a huge gap for growth. In my opinion, there is absolutely no doubt that 3D printing stocks will experience a **sky-rocketing long-term growth** similar to what Tesla has experienced but even beyond.


> BuT mimimi, 3D printing can never outperform sophisticated industry machines in terms of efficiency and cost.

This might be true for some products. Big companies with a specific set of products will likely continue to use sophisticated machines. However, 3D printing can be used to print exactly these sophisticated machines. Moreover, smaller companies and companies with a large set of varying products will undoubtedly benefit from 3D-printing.


To summarize the advantages of the technology:

* Reduction of human resources, production space, material waste and production time required.
* Less outsourcing required, therefore reducing global dependencies.
* Run with electricity, therefore potentially CO2-neutral.
* Extremely versatile and potential for all sectors in industry.

**The ARK 3D PRINTING ETF**

The ARK 3D PRINTING ETF (**$PRNT**) (ISIN: US00214Q5009) consists of business lines ranging from 3D-printing hardware, software, printing centers, scanning and measurement, as well as materials and resources. The fond is controlled by star investor Catherine D. Wood who was named the [best stock picker of 2020 by Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathie_Wood). 

3D printing is still in its infancy. In 2020, there was $17.5 billion in revenue for 3D printing. By comparison, Tesla alone made $31.5 billion in 2020. Toyota $250 billion. 

By 2025 alone, ARK expects sales to reach $120 billion. That would be a **7-fold increase**. However, the total potential is seen at $532.5 billion in the medium term (**30-fold increase**). McKinsey is even more optimistic and assumes sales of $180-490 billion by 2025 (10x-28x).

The **top 3 highest weighted stocks in the ETF are [EXONE (11.66%), 3D Systems (6.25%) and STRATASYS (5.62%)](https://ark-funds.com/3d-printing-etf)**.


**ExOne**

ExOne currently accounts for the highest share in the ARK 3D Print ETF with 11.66%. And because everything from star investor Catherine Woods is currently going gold, the hype here is probably only just beginning. With a market capitalization of $1.1 billion and sales of $59.41 million, it is also still very early in it's days. The current price cannot be justified by figures, even though the company has a **quarterly(!) sales growth of 59.9%**. That is why the P/E ratio here is very high at 15.23.
But what makes the company so special? Here, the big interest is likely to be the (quartz) SAND 3D printer. The biggest advantage here is probably simply the cost factor, since quartz sand is extremely cheap. The areas of application, as with all the other stocks presented, run through every area you can think of. In addition, there are metal printers, which could become particularly interesting in the heavy and automotive industries.

Pro:

* innovative quartz sand printers
* metal printers
* hype thanks to Catherine Woods and ARK-ETF
* 26.54% insider participation
* 48.49% institutional ownership (21% ARK)
* good revenue growth

Con:

* quite high PSR
* Little sales
* Free cash flow -5.67 million $
* only 300 employees

**3D Systems**

3D-Systems is currently the biggest player in 3D printing. We have already seen which areas 3D printing could revolutionize. 3D Systems offers a large variety of plastic and metal printing. They provide parts for automotive (cost reduction in production), aerospace (lightweighting), defense and military, dentistry, electronics (headphones, handsets), clothing (shoe soles) and more. That is why they are already working with NASA and Daimler among others.

Pro:

* market leader
* Innovative
* High number of employees compared to other companies in the sector (approx. 2500)
* A lot of experience (founded in 1986)
* Good cooperation partners
* Turnover makes it more than just an idea
* 68.02% participation of institutions (Blackrock 15.5%)
* 3.27% participation of insiders

Con:

* Low cash balance
* Low cash flow

**Stratasys**

Stratasys 3D printers are leading the way in plastics that can be used to make durable parts. To stay ahead in the technology battle here, they also recently bought out Origin for $100 million, which has worked with Henkel, BASF and DSM. Even if you have never heard of Origin: What seems particularly attractive here is that the set of plastics (whether soft or hard) is extremely versatile. The purchase alone is expected to generate $200 million in additional revenue over the next 5 years. From aerospace, to automotive parts, to fashion, many industries are covered. Among others, they have already worked with Volvo, Ford, Honda, Siemens, Audi, Airbus and Google.

Pro:

* 2266 employees (2017)
* Founded in 1989
* 308 million cash with only 19 million debt
* 78.17% institutional ownership (ARC 21.32%)
* 5.97% owned by insiders
* Leader in plastics and health care printing.
* Fair valuation

Con:

* No real USP
* Quarterly sales growth -18.8%

**Risks**

The recent hype around 3D-printing technology will lead to a temporary drop of stocks, affecting the ARK ETF (hype cycle). It might be smart to wait until the dust has settled a little and then start investing. Furthermore, the stock will be extremely volatile while climbing up, similarly as seen in the Tesla run. Panic sellers will likely lose money here.

This is no financial advice. 


**TL/DR:**

The 3D printing business has recently made huge advances such as printing medical equipment, protheses, weapons, shoes and even entire residential buildings and an aircraft. 3D printing is extremely versatile and can reduce costs of human resources, space requirements, materials and often increases efficiency. Even though the possibilities and advantages are enormous, **only 1% of the manufacturing market utilizes 3D printing** at this point. The industry is expected to **grow between 7 to 30-fold (!)** by 2025. The ARK 3D Printing ETF ($PRNT) contains the most important stocks to watch and is managed by Catherine Woods, who was named the best stock picker of 2020 according to Bloomberg News.",2021-02-18 01:32:34

Welcome to the Boomer EV play Fucking Ford $F,167,llwvea,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llwvea/welcome_to_the_boomer_ev_play_fucking_ford_f/,96,1613604236.0,"EDIT: [This right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford_vs_ferrari_part_1_greasing_the_wheels/) is far far far superior to my ramblings. Please look at that for more, but as always, do your research you Ape.

Alright here is the deal and I'm gonna tell ya. Everything right now is EV this, EV that, oooh heres a Lucid and theres a Lion, look at that NIO and wow what a Tesla! But what about the boomer version, what about the big money, classic company, total run up play of the EV market. Well I think its Ford and here are my reasons why:

Disclaimer: Blah blah not financial advice, blah blah do your own DD, blah blah don't trust random internet strangers for financial advice ya retard.

1. Right now Ford's Market Cap is just shy of $46 Billion. This is the Fourth largest automaker in the world in 2019 sorted by revenue. In other words, they are a big boy, they make cars, they've been doing it for over 100 years now, they know their shit. But still, they don't get much credit. Ford is often labeled the second biggest car company in America and never talked about. Why? They stale. You don't have to tell me they are boring, that's why I labeled this a boomer EV company. You invest in Ford for the dividend, because its stable, a high cap that's ole reliable. But here I'mma tell yew wat, that's changing. And the fact its perceived that way and is actually changing is gonna mean big big investment. Lets get to it.

Ford has a new CEO and his name is Jim Farley. Now this guy isn't the guy that's set the stage so far, and we will talk about that, but this guy has some unique energy.  In the last earnings call for GM and the one for Ford, they essentially reported the same thing. 4th quarter numbers were surprisingly good, company still lost some money, we are going to improve bottom line in 2021. But man oh man were the results different. Jim got on that phone and talked about taking warranty costs down and making 2021 a focus on tightening up the company even more, and boom the stock went up. I didn't even listen to the GM call, but the highlights were practically the same, and GM took a hit. The difference speaks for itself. Now if you want something of a character model for Jim but you are too lazy to look up and listen to video of him, just imagine Jim Farley as the modern day Tommy Boy (because you know... his cousin was Chris Farley.... who played Tommy Boy.... fucking young twats go watch the movie its hilarious!). He is determined to make Ford GreAT AgAIn!

2) Now some comparisons. As we all know, Tesla's fundamentals don't matter. But the idea here is that if Ford starts announcing money moves, its fundamentals will stop getting in the way! First off, the most relevant brands to compare here are going to be Tesla and Rivian, why? Model Y and the R1T are what Ford will be directly competing against first. And I'm going to break out the R1T first.

Lets face it. Everyone that is reading this post has touched, seen, ridden in, or at least heard of the F-150. It is the most recognized and biggest single vehicle brand in the world. GM can occasionally make and sell more trucks then the F-150, but they have to do it under two brands (Chevy and GMC). Ford tried making a luxury F-150 under Lincoln, but it didn't sell as well as just making a luxury F-150 (think platinum editions). Why does this matter? Ford is going to make an electric F-150. This has been a rumor for so so so long, but the massive investment in Rivian and the latest confirmations have shown that Ford has put a lot of effort into developing an acceptable electric drivetrain for the F-150. Now lets look at the R1T that will be the direct competitor. Rivian is expected to IPO soon and is looking to get an initial evaluation of $50 billion. Oh wait, what's that? An EV company that is launching with 1 or 2 models wants to be a $50 billion company? And Ford is going to compete in that space with a similar product and is only currently a $46 billion company? Hmmmmm.... If the electric F-150 is teased in September and it is at all competitive with R1T that alone should double the stock value. Ford would be gaining a whole new set of customers with a stronger brand name and already established manufacturing base and quality, and they wouldn't need to fight the uphill battle of trying to get into Tesla's well established brand and market of small and luxury EVs, they are getting into EV pickups the same time as everyone else! This is arguably the biggest reason I think the stock is going to double this year, but it needs proper setup to truly understand the potential.

3) Lets work back up the time line here. Ford can't just bust onto the scene with an electric F-150 and expect to take the cake and eat it too. Big boomer name auto companies are viewed as old and unmoving, they can't make changes, as someone I know tries to explain to me, ""Its suCH a BiG boAT Its gOInG to TAkE FoRevER to CHanGE CoUrSe!."" What they fail to realize is that Ford has been making moves to switch it up for years. What did they result in? Why the Mustang Mach-E of course.

The Mach-E is currently one of the most polarizing vehicles in the American vehicle enthusiast communities right now. You gotta understand. Ford made it through years of selling lackluster (in my opinion dogshit) Mustangs on the name alone! It has an image, a brand, that carried the full lineup even when Mustangs were slow and didn't know how to make power and meet emissions (or be fun). And that branding means anything with the Mustang name attached should be a two seater coupe with power and loud, dirty, gas powered bad boy image behind it. Ford could have made the Mustang Mach-E a new model, they could have made it its own thing and launched it as a new EV, the start of a new era or some other friendly bullshit. But instead Ford said, ""we need eyes on this thing and we need to make a point with it. What should we do?"" and the one guy in the room who didn't give a fuck anymore said, ""Well call it a Mustang, that'll do it."" And the fucking Chads did it! What's GM's big EV at the moment? The bolt, which they already burnt the branding on with dumb looks and weird commercials, and the Hummer, oh great a dead brand for people who need you to know they have a big swinging dick maybe. Ford is showing that they have the willingness to leverage their most recognized brands to launch a new EV image of the company. That's huge! And if the Mach-E does well, performs good, and gives a good impression to the car media people, that will be the real proper setup for the electric F-150. Especially since it can be compared directly to the Model Y. It'll be Ford vs Tesla, and all Ford has to do is go the 12 rounds, they don't even really have to win.

4) So now we get into the boomer money and how its going to set this thing off. Now I know I talked about our favorite boomer auto CEO Jim Farley, but lets talk for a second about everything that's happened before he got there. Ford is exiting the sedan and car market in North America. Why? It doesn't make money. Why is Ford so concerned about making big money. Aside from it being a company, well its balance sheet doesn't look too good. Is it horrible? Meh, the Debt to Equity is still horrendous, but the rest of it isn't bad per se. Ford has been trimming and fine tuning its production for years to get out of the debt it took on during the financial crisis and the last thing they wanted to do was retool everything to make EVs. But despite having a ridiculous ratio they've snuck investing in EV, battery tech, charging tech, and autonomous into the budget over the years. And Jim is taking over and immediately talking about reducing warranty costs and on hand inventory and things, the traditional stuff that hits Ford's operating bottom line. This is great! Improve profitability, that's what boomer and institutional investment love to hear. So, do we think the stock could go down? Well, look at the bears, the short interest in the float is super super super low, something around 1-2%. No one thinks this stock is going lower. And that's a good thing. It means almost everyone in Ford is in it as an investment and those buys aren't going anywhere. And it means, this is the entry point, it takes off from here. As Ford starts to come up and we see a steady rise over this year more and more institutional money and boomer retail will get in for the value growth.

5) As for gas. This is part of why I think Ford is a great all around sentiment change value investment. For years Ford has been releasing fun cars with the intent to rejuvenate the brand like the Focus RS and the Fiesta, but they were niche vehicles that still tried to be economic and whose base trims were still normal and boring. But it wasn't until recently that they have started to blatantly play into the enthusiast's desires in an attempt to build rep with actual car people again. Look at the Mustang GT350, GT350R, GT500, the Bronco, the new F-150 Raptor R. These aren't attempts to make a ""Green and eco friendly lineup"" no no no these are blatant fan favs that people have been screaming for for years! And branding is everything. And when you can already make bombass cars like these, people tend to trust you to make other things like that electric commuter car you really need.

6) Finally we get to the last and arguably the biggest reason this stock could pop off. Fleet vehicles. Ford controls around 40% of the fleet vehicle market. Think about that. All those companies that need fleets of vehicles that you can think of, 2 out of 5 are Ford supplied. I personally work at a company that uses fleet vehicles as a perk for the upper management and you know what they all have? Ford F-150s. About 12 of them parked in a nice little row in the parking lot. And you know whats weird about that? The next row is of normal employees that want to be like management, and my beat to hell Dodge Ram from 20 years ago stands out like a sore thumb between another nice little row of pretty new F-150s. Its a weird effect, but my point being fleet vehicles is a huge market, and when they start going electric, Ford will be poised to take up even more market share. Not only will Ford be able to pick up sales from fleet vehicles, but Ford already offers electric transit vans, you know, the kinda vans that do last mile stuff like install your cable, or DELIVER YOUR AMAZON PACKAGES. Yeah, those types of vans. Fleets of those will be going electric soon. And government contracts? Oh you better believe Ford is gonna get its share of those through the Green new deal. Fucking A is it.

7) And now we get into the latest and greatest stuff. Ford is investing in building electric where electric is going to sell well with a huge investment in Germany. But this also means that they think they can make more money competing directly against Tesla in Europe as well. Now that's confidence considering how crowded the EV market is in Europe already. But also, Ford keeps making money moves in the EV space and really focusing on building an EV side of the company instead of trying to transition its Gas side. This is good, it means that they hope to add value as opposed to transition it which is what will blow the roof off the market cap!

Anyways, thats what I got. Its not great and I can talk for hours, but its an honest opinion.

TL;DR Fuck you, that took a long time to write! Electric F-150, Mustang Mach-E, Ford not afraid to leverage its biggest brands, electric transit vans, fleet contracts, government contracts, exciting gas powered cars like GT350,GT500, Bronco, Raptor R, new Chad of a CEO Jim Farley who is modern day Tommy Boy, Improving fundamentals that Boomers care about, and coming out the gates this year swinging for Tesla. Also Rivian is gonna IPO for more than Ford is worth?

The Rocket is still Fueling. Buy Your Tickets for $SENS ASAP,1335,llvup5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llvup5/the_rocket_is_still_fueling_buy_your_tickets_for/,651,1613601415.0,"Here we go Gents - my first DD.

I've been a casual autist for years, but I finally feel like I have something to give back, in terms of a short, succinct DD.

First - let's make this clear. I'm an autist. This isn't financial advice. Just yesterday, I tweaked my shoulder eating dinner. And it wasn't even my fork shoulder.  

I know I'm not the first to mention $SENS on here, but let me give you 5 reasons why you should put in your order for some tendies before the kitchen gets too backed up.

 üöÄ ) $SENS is a company focused on Diabetes tech. Why should you care? Because us 'Muricans love our tendies and a good chunk of us have eaten so many that our pancreas stopped working. The diabetes industry is massive AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK IS OWNED BY ONE COMPANY - $DXCM. What the fuck? This is $SENS DD and you're bringing up a competitor? Yes. I'm telling you it's 2015 and you're getting the option to buy $AMD at $5 even though $NVDA owns the space. The runway is LONG and HARD my sweet prince. $DXCM has a market cap of over $40b. $SENS is under $2b. I'm not saying they're going to switch places or even out. I'm saying $SENS is criminally undervalued right now and could easily hit $15-20 in the very near future and in my uneducated opinion - go to $50 by EoY.

 üöÄ  üöÄ ) $SENS has tech that is mind numbingly better than $DXCM. If you aren't aware, $DXCM makes those sensors you see stuck to hips or arms that measure tendies:blood in real time. It's a huge leap forward from the old days of having to prick your finger every hour. HOWEVER these sensors need to be changed out regularly. How often is regularly? Five to ten DAYS. I personally called my diabetic friend and he said it was annoying AF. $SENS takes a difference approach, with their sensor lasting 3 MONTHS. 3 MONTHS > 10 DAYS. This is disruptive.

 üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ) $SENS has a rocky history that can be completely explained by several rational decisions. If you've gotten to my third point, there's a decent chance I have you interested by now. But eventually you're going to look at $SENS trading history and realize it was at $5 years ago and tumbled down to $0.50. WTF? Well - most of this is easily explained. They raised capital several times, which we all knows kills stock value. They were attacked by our good friends on Wall St. And the FDA delayed their testing (in various capacities) by over a year due to COVID. Raising capital is a good thing long term. The FDA has finally moved forward with the critical 180 day test (i'm told this is the final step towards approval, but don't quote me) and Wall St. can go fuck themselves.

 üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ) $SENS 'looks better' and will be 'cleaner' to use. WTF? Who gives a shit about looks? Well - just about everyone. No one wants a Tamagotchi glued to their hip/arm for everyone to see. It's unsightly. The $SENS system is a subdermal (I think it means under the skin) implant that communicates with your phone every 5 minutes rather than relying on a sensor above the skin taped on like a barbarian. Not only will it look better, but it's also more reliable. Remember all the way back in 2) where I mentioned the 90 day vs 10 day thing? Imagine you're in the military and on active deployment. Which one do you think the Army is going to assign you? Word on the street is the $SENS system will be the choice of sensor by the military in the very near future and it makes complete sense when you think about how dirt and shit can mess up an external sensor.

üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ) This is WallStreetBETS. We aren't here to invest safely. The fifth reason to invest in $SENS is when we blast off to the moon, you don't want to be the one saying 'fuck, I should have listened to that useful idiot when I had the chance.'

Blackberry slipping after Canacord report. Hold and buy that dip üíéüíéüôåüôåüöÄüöÄ,579,llv6j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llv6j9/blackberry_slipping_after_canacord_report_hold/,185,1613599466.0,"
BlackBerry shares have been volatile due to a targeted short squeeze, Canaccord Genuity says, downgrading the stock to sell.  BB lost ground Tuesday after the tech-security and software company was downgraded to sell from hold by a Canaccord Genuity analyst, who raised concern about volatility in the shares. 

Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario, company at last check were down 6.7% to $12.10.
Analyst T. Michael Walkley, who raised his price target on BlackBerry to $10 a share from $8, said in a note to investors that the company's software security product portfolio is improving.
The analyst also said the company has made strides integrating the software firm Cylance, which it purchased in 2018 for $1.4 billion, and creating a ""compelling"" cybersecurity platform. 

However, Walkley said, with the volatility in the shares from a ""targeted short squeeze,"" the share price is above his increased price target.
The company received a sharp boost from retail traders recently and had been heavily mentioned on online message boards such as Reddit, where companies like GameStop  (GME) were also featured.
Walkley said that even though the stock has pulled back sharply from its ""Reddit driven rally"" to its January high, ""our analysis leads us to believe the shares are still overvalued.""


TLDR: hold onto your crayons.  BB is a long hold and I'm buying during this dip. 300@$13 200@12

Best in biotech $SAVA DD,22,llv44y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llv44y/best_in_biotech_sava_dd/,23,1613599265.0,"The older I get the more retarded I feel, in comes SAVA to save me from myself. Do not take what I say as advice (see the previous sentence), I just like the stock. I have been following SAVA for my entire 3 week career as an investor and when I saw the spike in SAVA a few weeks ago and heard about the Alzheimer's Disease(AD) drug Sumufilam they were developing, it piqued my interest so I started to do some digging.

This is my first (lazy apes) DD so it is going to be lacking. I am a moron, I know how to read words, it's the numbers that still trip me up. Here are a few key points I have learned from reading recent news.

No new AD drugs approved since 2003. Current medications have limited function to treat symptoms. Sumufilam takes a novel approach in its action (for retards: fancy new products make big money).

13 Nov. 2020 IPO 9,375,000 shares at 8.00

02 Feb. 2021 Data from open-label study of Sumufilam showed significant increase in cognition and function in those with AD. Stock price surges from 18.93 to 87.95.

10 Feb. 2021 Stock draws back sharply with profit taking and a widely denounce $200m institutional stock sale to fund phase 3 trials from 87.95 to 44.80. I buy in at 46.12.

16 Feb. 2021 SAVA announces plans for a Phase 3 trial in late 2021 price increase to 51.83

It would be great if someone could take a deeper dive into this company. I really dont know what the hell I am doing, I am just a healthcare provider with a hope and a dream.

Edit: I used to ""read"" Maxim in the late 90s and dream of becoming a boyfriend to one of the hotties while their husband made me rich. Apparently they set a SAVA price target of $80 this morning.
