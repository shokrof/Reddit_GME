Anyone paying attention to $FIZZ (LaCroix parent company)? 83% short interest,0,laxjq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxjq6/anyone_paying_attention_to_fizz_lacroix_parent/,8,1612307019.0,"Edited to add screenshot of positions, sorry.

Not many here seems to have noticed $FIZZ, which I believe is second to $GME in % of float shorted at 83% (7.3M shares shorted and 8.8M float) as shown in the below image.

https://preview.redd.it/flifodkhv2f61.jpg?width=846&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb639e01bd342030018d0343821b20d7918d793

It hasn't gone as crazy or gotten as much hype as some of the other recent ""short squeezes"". Volume is typically very low, making it hard for shorts to cover without big price swings. Last week moved almost 100% on total of like 12M volume, but has come most of the way back down on hardly any volume (1.7M Friday when the price started to drop and 1.1M total yesterday). It's down 10% today on only 150,000 shares traded, so it has massive 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕 potential if people start to notice it more.

I posted about it a couple of weeks ago, but $FIZZ is also just generally a good company:

* Known brand (parent company of LaCroix)
* Highly profitable
* Upside potential (CBD-infused and/or ""hard"" drinks)
* $6/share special dividend

Here are my posts from a couple weeks ago with more details.

Volume chart patterns,93,laycz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laycz7/volume_chart_patterns/,19,1612308961.0,"Hello fellow apes. First post here. 

Listen up, I want to talk about the volume charts on GME along with everything we’re seeing right now to help you make the decision to be a 💎🙌 chad or paper handed b***. 

My thesis: GME to the moon, and the negative price movement we’re seeing right now is a non-fucking-issue. 

Some facts:
-RH restricted trading for GME past few days pushing price down synthetically 
-silver bots spamming WSB
-simultaneous coordinated media attacks to control the narrative telling us that retail has pivoted to silver
-Melvin down >50% in JANUARY (oops)
-S3 data looks fishy 

So back to the volume charts. “Oh shit GME is down” whatever, it doesn’t matter. Here’s why I’m confident that this is purposeful, possibly short ladder attacks. 

At open 1/28, 2/1 and 2/2 MASSIVE volume for those days both at open pushing the price down, which was followed by low volume. 

My interpretation: HFs trying to dispel hype and our faith by large volume selling at open (look at counterfeit stocks, can’t find link) to depress price and kill momentum. 

Not financial advice, just my interpretation and why I’m down 50% but don’t fucking care. 💎🙌

Cutting Through FUD,91,layb2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/,3,1612308823.0,"Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship

# An update from IG Group CEO June Felix

**An update from IG Group CEO June Felix**

**Dear Retard**

We are in the midst of an unfolding situation in global markets which is attracting a significant number of new traders to trading platforms to buy particular stocks in a coordinated way.

This has caused a significant increase in trading volumes and demands on our platform. As a result of this some clients have experienced disruption to service. This has fallen short of the high standards we set ourselves and the service you deserve. For those clients who have experienced disruption, I would like to offer you my sincere apologies, and assure you we are addressing these issues as a matter of urgency.

We took a number of steps immediately and continue to implement additional measures to avoid any further disruption:

1.Our teams are working around the clock to improve the resilience, login and trading capacity of the platform2.We have significantly increased the number of support staff available to assist you, with 24-hour support available at [helpdesk.uk@ig.com](mailto:helpdesk.uk@ig.com). If you have emailed the helpdesk we will get back to you.3.We have temporarily paused new account opening so that we can focus on providing our existing clients with the service they deserve.

**We have also made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend new trading on GameStop and AMC Entertainment**. We fundamentally believe in empowering our clients and enabling them to trade what they want, when they want, how they want. This decision has been entirely motivated by our desire to ensure our platform and services remain fully operational for existing clients, as we prioritise giving you the best service we can.

We will continue to closely monitor this quickly evolving situation. We will bring in additional measures if necessary and seek to remove any trading restrictions as soon as possible.

If you don't sell, the price won't go down. Buy and hold on mass can make everyone, especially the initial investors very rich. It is the basis for the recent gains in tech. The public sentiment is creating value in many of these companies. Just look at ZM. It's a direct consequence of democratized trading and it will become more and more influential. 


Everyone has the misconception that a stock's price is determined by some true value+potential of the company. In fact, the potential of a company is actually in part a function of stock price. This means that a large group of buyers of the stock can directly fund as well as motivate managers and CEOs to stay interested in building a successful company. I'm sure the new management doesn't want to squander our support. The price is a barometer of public reputation which is a strong indicator of longevity. That's what the market wants most in the end. 

Democratizing trading will allow publicly popular companies to redeem themselves financially. In a sense, it is a safety net of public faith. If gamestop management can capitalize on our support, the is real potential it can turn itself around. I spoke to a relative of mine who was a former manager at a gamestop who said that the new management dreams of turning stores into social hubs like Starbuck's. By cultivating a friendly environment for gamers, they can capitalize on an open market. This will be especially successful if a roaring 20s type decade unfolds (assuming the vaccine is successful in stopping the virus, which it is poised to do so far according to researchers like Nicholas Christakis at Yale).  This would ensure gamestop becomes a physical environment of the gaming community for the foreseeable future, occupying a niche I think no other company is better positioned to seize. 


I say let's fund that dream and reap the spoils.

Once again the world has sought to divide us. Yesterday it was with silver and short ladder attacks. Last week, with brokerages. Before that, politics, race, Android and Apple, football and football, smooth brain and smoother brain. This narrative has dragged on for as long as I can remember. 

The hedge fund managers and corporate backers and media pundits who've pushed us towards failure for decades are the same who seek our failure today. To them, we're no different than the commodities and securities they so freely and fragrantly manipulate. At our expense they use our diamond hands, gorilla strength, and full tilt retardation against us, and the truth is that until now we've drooled idly by and let it happen. We let them overshort us to the brink of moral bankruptcy, economic collapse, and cultural disaster, while they sat back and stuffed their pockets with our tendies. 

Until $GME.

We, in all of our smooth brained glory, came together in the name of a hopeless cause because we believed we had the power to change it for the better. We set aside our differences and agreed that despite them, we found something worth fighting for. Today we stood shoulder to shoulder with the great apes of old. We fervently beat our chests with diamond hands and shouted ""HOLD"" as we stared down our oppressors. Some paper hands fled in the face of this tyranny, but we HELD! In glorious revolution we lit our forges and fired that paper into endless diamonds.

Now, on the frontline of yet another bloody battlefield, we find ourselves strapped onto the backs of rockets. Ready to launch ourselves into the heavens if only to add more stars to the night sky for those below us. We do not fear death, for what's $323 worth when priced against the soul of our people? Take in the enemies terror. Look them in the eyes as we take to the stars my friends, for they'll speak of us generations from now.

Apes bring hope. Diamond hands no drive good, rockets only go up. We go too?

Make no mistake, we are here fighting for so much more than $GME, but it is absolutely $GME that we're fighting for. Believe in us. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better world for all smooth brains where the bulls**t the elites pull on us and call ""protection"" is brought to the dirt and burned off in the glow of our afterburners.

With hands like diamonds we sail into the tides of eternity,
Monkeys amongst the stars.

Robinhood can suck my unwashed taint, but where can I find an app that still makes my 3 brain wrinkles tingle and doesn't have a UI that looks like a hospital intranet from 1995 (sorry Fidelity but your platform is a massive piece of shit).

The answer I just found is Public. It has a nice UI that's easy to understand like Robinhood, but instead of cutting off its basic services when the going gets tough they actually pushed back on the powers at be to keep unrestricted access to our precious GME and its associates during last week's shitstorm.

So is this an advertisement for Public? Yeah I guess so. I'm not going to plug a ref link in here because I'm not an autistic garbage boy, but I will say that it's pretty dope.

**HUGE ADDED PLUS**

There's a social aspect to it where you can comment on trades and see what people are doing. This is most important because **you can see when people paper hand and see how much they lost**.

[Screenshot of some fucking bungus paper handing his position](https://imgur.com/5K6UJhT)

So they've got a built in gain/loss porn feature which is hype because that's basically what we're all about here.

TL;DR

There's a Robinhood adjacent app with a built in gain/loss porn feature called Public and it isn't one of the dinosaur platforms with a UI that looks like a 1990's book store website. Also you can buy as much GME as you want while you laugh at the people losing 70%+ after holding for 2 days.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,170,lay5wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay5wi/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/,27,1612308480.0,"Hello all,

(written Monday so ""tomorrow"" = Tuesday 2nd"")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.

First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. 

Q3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)

* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  

   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.
   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.
* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.
* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.
* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.

Q4 Preliminary Results:

[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)

* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.
* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.

It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. 

*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021

&#x200B;

Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. 

As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:

\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.

\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)

\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)

Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent.

Now, on to the NBA:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)

""Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV’s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world – Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.""

David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.

Why am I bringing up the NBA?

[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)

People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. 

The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, lets look into two key acquisitions: 

\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. 

Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.

&#x200B;

Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)

34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. 

Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. 

Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.

Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.",2021-02-03 01:25:59

GME Devils Advocate 🚀🚀🚀,49,lay2go,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay2go/gme_devils_advocate/,22,1612308249.0,"I think most people can agree that based on fundamentals(what is that), GME is way over valued. So if I were a hedge fund now that the crash has started this seems like a guaranteed profit if I shorted it.

What does this mean? If short interest really did drop(no one really believes that right?) then new shorts are being opened, especially if they think they can drive the price down using ladders and other manipulation. If you continue to hold there can be a short squeeze, maybe a second stage booster if you will. The new shorts instead of being in at $20 are now in at $110. This means they will probably hold longer until they cover. Could easily go back up, not just to the moon but Mars or Pluto or another Galaxy.

This is not investment insight. This is not analysis. This is the smooth-brained ramblings of a post-wisdom tooth extraction anesthesia fog.*

I have enjoyed the regular glut of armchair ""analysts"" showing that ladder attacks and slow fades have only been low volume events, implying that hedge funds are just manipulating prices for reasons (probably psychological reasons, maybe contractual ones). Maybe even doing it with counterfeit shares. 

I don't know anything about that. 

But don't forget, when high volume events (like the recent drop) *do* occur, that may not necessarily imply high retail involvement. 

Short ladder attacks may be able to be accomplished with low quantities of shares being traded back and forth as others have described. But there's nothing stopping hedge funds from doing the same with millions of shares, especially if counterfeit shares are actually that easy to produce and then dissolve.

I really liked the movie where that one CGI monke used American Sign Language to tell the other CGI monke that APE TOGETHER STRONG.

I feel like the reason we are losing this battle is because people are getting panicked and they are selling their shares to recover their investments. A big reason for that could be the fact that so many trading platforms are banning the trade of GME and AMC which kinda sends a bad signal to the average joe trading these shares. And not to forget about the fact that the media is portraying the WSB group as a bunch of evils.
So now the next question for the average joe is what should i do? I mean people need to relax a little and swallow that chill pill. 
You bought some shares on platform X and cant trade them - hold hold hold and try to find platform Y where trading is not banned. If you can, buy some on platform Y but dont sell the ones on plat.X
If we can all hold together, we can win this battle and create history.

Im 10 k deep into GME and AMC and the best thing to do atm is to relax and forget about your investment.

PS.
This is not a financial advice. Ima retard who is gonna hold GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-02-03 01:16:57

Here's the truth,59,laxviv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxviv/heres_the_truth/,52,1612307790.0,"This was over the minute billionaire grifters and media got in on it. After RH got hobbled last week, that was the last nail in the coffin. It resulted in 6M people joining this subreddit that refused to listen to anything that wasn't confirmation bias. Every single post was the same ""This is not advice, I'm retard [rocket]"". Every DD that didn't support that narrative was considered a bot post (even though they had long post history). When people start putting up billboards, that's when you know it's squoozed.



1) The short interest is still ""121%"" ""226%"" ""53% is fake!""


- the actual short interest is published 2x per month with a huge delay when between the reporting date and the publish date
- this means you are always getting either stale data (like the ones referenced in media) or modeled data (Ortex, S3)
- with this much volatility within a few days, there is almost no way to accurately model this

2) Shorts have to cover in 1.8 days!!!


- shorts are not options, they don't have an expiration date
- shorts pay interest payments to the issuer, at an annualized rate, NOT a daily rate
- this means, if the interest rate is 60% for a $300 share, the interest payment per day is only $0.50/day



3) Short interest is indicator of time to squeeze!


- no, short interest does not tell you the average price it was shorted at
- those that shorted < $50 likely had to cover early but they reentered short positions at the top
- this means that the net short interest is the same, but the average short price increases from say $50 to $250
- as long as they have buying opportunities below the current price, they can remain short



4) The VW Squeeze!


- completely different situation where 75% of the outstanding shares were unavailable 
- the squeeze wasn't triggered by retail, it was triggered by porshe's announcement
- 77% of GME ownership is by institutions, they can also sell OTC to shorts



5) All the Calls are ITM, Gamma Squeeze!


- most of the calls were sold as covered calls by institutions like Blackrock Fidelity etc. that were going to make money regardless of what price they sold it at
- even if some of the calls were uncovered, they likely delta hedged throughout the week, not wait until Friday afternoon to buy



6) Melvin is still in!


- Citadel and Point72 didn't hand over $2.75B so they can lose more money, they did it with an exit plan in mind
- MMs don't look at trades emotionally, they have customers to appease
- trade volume was far more than they needed to exit over a period of 5-7 days, they likely also shorted more on the way up",2021-02-03 01:16:30

WHY GME IS DOWN,666,laxqgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxqgp/why_gme_is_down/,148,1612307456.0,"Fellow retards, bag-holders, u/Lansman grandma and paper-hands,

lets look at the facts:

1) Short % according to S3 is still at 122% ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/))

2) Robinhood is still not allowing users to trade securities freely. These include $GME, which artificially creates selling pressure. They are currently raising money to have capital on hand, or liquidity, to allow users to freely trade all positions again. As soon as this happens $GME will 🚀, similar to Friday.

3) All users who transferred their accounts from Robinhood to other brokerages still need time, it takes 3-5 days on average. Meaning eow the first users will be able to buy stocks freely again, those will include $GME. This will create another spike in GameStop. I heard fidelity is great, I personally use TDA & eTrade.

4) Volume is low. Meaning all the restrictions they placed on users to exclude them from free market access obviously worked, but the real diamond hands aren't selling. As soon as people realize they made a mistake, people will pile in. This will happen latest eow as brokerages allow users to trade the stocks again AND call options expire. Another spike will probably trigger HF's to finally cover their short positions again, as they currently believe they have ""won"" the fight and successfully diverted our attention.

5) They got you right? They destroyed your believe in the short squeeze? See how you feel? That's exactly what they wanted. Don't call the fight yet, this is round 4 of 12, we will knock them out soon. Just hold tight and buy what you can. This dip will not last long and you will bite your 🌈🐻 ass when $GME rockets to $1000.

Exercising my OTM expiring Calls,47,laxpp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxpp4/exercising_my_otm_expiring_calls/,11,1612307407.0,"I know the usual suggestion for calls is to sell to close contracts, or to let them expire worthless, rather than exercising, but i don't think that applies in the current short market.

Right now i have contracts that expire friday, and due to short ladder attacks, have fallen well short of the breakeven.  But im considering exercising them anyway.

If the currently depressed prices are real, then nothing substantial will change after I get my 100 shares per contract.  The brokers wont need to buy more at higher prices to fill my order.  They can buy it at the price it is now and walk away with profit.

But if the prices are truly gamed, and 10k other people also just happen to have my same perspective, we will force the brokers to purchase millions of shares, that may or may not be available, at asking prices.  This either ensures we both lose on the deal, or that i win.  And i win by watching their buys drive the price back to its actual cost, while i get 100 shares to instantly be able to hold or sell immediately for the proper price on the market.

"Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff",1,laxp6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxp6m/some_thoughts_on_silver_gme_and_game_changing/,5,1612307372.0,"# Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let’s brake some things down:

SILVER:

It’s   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn’t screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn’t find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: “What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations.

Where is the SEC? Where is our government? They’re bought by citadel and other hedge Funds being held hostage by the lie that a GME squeeze will take down the economy. Their strategies to counter the buy pressure was totally ineffective until they shutdown Robinhood and Webull. They’ve illegally counterfeited shares and manipulated the media right in front of the public eye. 

Rebellions reach a tipping point, one where they stick it out against all the odds, or fold under the pressure. You wanted to know what it was like to fight Wall Street? Now you do.

1. Cover at the lowest price possible
2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo

Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

FDA Approval Imminent for $BLUE,20,laxn4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxn4p/fda_approval_imminent_for_blue/,34,1612307237.0,"Hey All,

Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year: [$OZK](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j52m4n/bank_ozk_the_new_century_financial_of_the_current/) &  [$FIT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j9zayy/why_fitbit_will_trade_higher_than_735_acquisition/). Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still think they're shit. 

Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.

The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.

On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug [Career Site Link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bluebirdbioinc/jobs/2291768). These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.  

The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $3.90 per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.

TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP.",2021-02-03 01:07:17

These are dark times. Trust each other. Your money is more than in your own hands. This community is a brotherhood. We win and lose together. And we are powerful. I woke up today and realized; it's just money. And the fear of losing went away quickly, and I calmed down. Money is so fucking stupid when you actually think about it. We're all gonna die one day. Anyway I'm getting too philosophical lol.

Again, I'm saying it could stay like this for a while. Don't watch the stock. Set your limits and step away. This is a draining game, physically and mentally. Don't let yourself lose. Meditate, workout, read, watch TV, spend time with family, I don't care, just do anything but watch the ticker.

-	Shorts perform an important and healthy function in a market. If they are wrong, they provide stocks at a cheaper price for you. 
-	Bankruptcy doesn’t always destroy a business if the underlying is good. Instead, it reorganizes it.

Wallstreetbets used to be about young males trying to look retarded and not taking themselves too seriously.

"If you want to hurt the shorts, GME is no longer the best target",0,laxjli,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laxjli/if_you_want_to_hurt_the_shorts_gme_is_no_longer/,34,1612307010.0,"The key to hurting short sellers, and triggering a squeeze, is to turn their positions into the red. Only then will they maybe get margin called or trigger their risk protocols.

This depends crucially on the price they started shorting. For example, if a HF shorts 1000 shares of GME at $4, and it is now $100, they have $4000 cash and a short interest of $100,000, with a loss of $96,000. Meanwhile a hedge fund that shorted at $300 and the stock is now $100, is sitting on $300,000 cash, a $200,000 gain, and $100,000 short interest.

Unfortunately, according to Ihor/S3's data (giving him the benefit of the doubt), the current GME short interest is 8.8 billion on 27 million shares shorted. This means the current shorts started at $325 dollars a share. For us to meaningfully hurt their books we would have to drive the share price to like $400-$600 \*without\* a short squeeze before a short squeeze happens. That takes a lot, specifically 10s of billions of dollars, so I don't see that happening soon, even with whales etc. on our side. Sadly, the broker shenanigans seem to have given them a chance to slip out.

(GME data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509) )

So now what? The best we can do is hold and wait for material events to happen related to the turnaround. As Ryan Cohen succeeds, we will have the winds behind our back to try this again in a few months.

In the meantime, consider these stocks instead: FUBO and BBBY. Both have decent businesses and high short interest at a reasonable price.

(short data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1) )

FUBO is a growing streaming platform that is great for live sports. It is growing and has a lot of wall street analyst support. It is heavily shorted at 67% of float, with the shorts in at $50. Wall street analysts have also recently set 50 price target, and the stock is at 50. FUBO is thus a great candidate to paint some HF books red.

BBBY is not as good of a target, but has a credible turnaround story like GME, and is currently sitting at $26 dollars, with the shorts in at $52 according to S3. This could move with an order of magnitude less capital than GME before the shorts start seeing losses.

Happy hunting.

If they think a price is ballooning, they WILL short it. They all doubt these prices will hold and continued. They are leveraged between each other, and strategizing amongst themselves to profit off a bubble. 

Every single “WSB stock” has been shorted out the ass over the last week. $GME, $AMC, $BB, $EXPR....and all the rest. They are moving as one 

Every single dip retail traders with 💎🙌 are acquiring an increasing share of the float. At some point the hedge funds are all just trading borrowed shares amongst each other. The more you buy and hold, the less power they have, and the more shares they’re going to need to reacquire.  

They don’t want you to know it but WSB is a powerful decentralized hedge fund. An average of 4 shares each is all it will take for this sub to become the largest controlling interest of the GME float (and the rest).

Can’t afford $GME shares? Wait for a dip or buy one of the other stocks. They’re spreading their risk over all of them.  

Every time you buy the dip and hold shares they are digging themselves into a deeper hole. 

Remember that short interest data you’ve seen until now is total bs. The firms do not report short data for last month until tonight at 6pm, and the results won’t be made public until 2/9. S3 and the others are putting  out completely arbitrary speculations based on computer models. In reality they have no idea because the numbers haven’t been reported yet! 


Buy the damn dips! Hold!

I know you don't believe data etc and your bias wants you to believe the short interest stats are all nonsense, but when all available short interest indicators have collapsed after a meteoric price rise - its over. see below.  


The remaininng short interest is easy to cover, and there's no reason to believe you can squeeze it higher - your powder is probably mostly shot (seriously, how many of you have anything left in the chamber? there's $1tn of hedge fund money on the other side waiting to pound you out). this is the end. the squeeze was last week. its over. get out while you still can.

Why WSB and the GME short squeeze are actually more important than they seem,17,layh55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layh55/why_wsb_and_the_gme_short_squeeze_are_actually/,1,1612309251.0,"WSB and the GME short squeeze are actually incredibly important to how the stock market might work in the near future because it shows that retail investors who want to invest in a certain stock (e.g. they hear about a company they value that's shutting down) can cooperate into a larger investing unit - on the scale of corporate blocs if they have enough people - effectively influencing the fate of businesses while spreading out the costs and benefits among the individual investors to minimize risk and maximize reward (allowing everyday people to save a company they enjoy and potentially earn money for doing it without fear of bankruptcy, or defund corporations they dislike using shorts and also potentially earn money for it). It shows that the field is actually even if retail investors are allowed to conglomerate, and that the citizenry can have almost equal will over the fate of the economy as corporate investors by communicating and uniting with each other. Even though I only make $1600 per month as a full time, $10/hr employee, if I like a business that is going down due to what I feel is undervaluation - or even if I dislike a business that I think is overvalued (either due to overestimation of benefit to society or underestimation of cost \*cough\* \*cough\* every large Wall Street backed social media company \*cough\* \*cough\* blights to society) - I can come here and tell other retail investors like you guys why I think they should invest in/short the company I like/dislike too and turn the $100 I can safely invest every paycheck into something much more influential depending on how much of a case I can make for/against that business. When retail investors work together, we act as the correcting force to the over- and undervaluation forces created by corporate investors like what is happening with GME and all of the other undervalued stocks that are rising right now because of WSB.",2021-02-03 01:40:51

This is just another cheap manipulation of the market. This is call a ladder attack and it wont work unless u sell your shares. For those who are not familiar with this kind of terms: they are basically tradding a couple thousand between Melvin Capital and their friends lowering the prices each time they trade shares. By doing this they just push the price lower and lower, and you will ask: but can they just push it lower and whenever its enought low but all the short shares that are in debt? Technically yes, but no, I mean they can push it till 1$ if they wish, but it wont work unless somebody sell some shares. So do not be afraid my darlings just check the **""Trading Volume""** stat and you will notice the trap. Stay calm and dont be smooth brains, just remember we are some autists diamonds hands 🙌💎 and buy the dip.

I dont own it, but thats what i would do."" - Mark Cuban",105,layh0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layh0d/some_motivation_for_gme_spoken_by_wbs_very_own/,6,1612309240.0,"\*\*This keeps getting removed... hopefully it will stick.\*\*\*\*

From Today's AMA with Mark Cuban, READ THIS.

""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""

I see some WSB posts that are totally panicked. We need to remember why we are here in the first place. Do you want to see the Hedge funds win? NO! then HOLD THE LINE AND DON'T SELL!!!! 💎🤲💎

Restrict buying inflow which allows low volume sell pressure to crater the stock. Not only does this kill morale, it also triggers a bunch of margin calls allowing them to take away more shares that they desperately need. 

What to do? I’m holding. But that may not be enough. There seems to be a lot noise about if they closed their shorts or not. No one will know definitively until the official numbers are out. There was huge volume at the end of Friday, I assume it’s possible a portion was covered then. If they continue to restrict shares we are looking to buy over a long enough period of time, they will win. UNLESS we buy the fucking dip and hold to our convictions; war isn’t pretty. I know that we’ve made a statement but so many times has the world forgotten about the latest social movement just because the higher ups know that time kills unity and motivation in times of FUD. Buy if you can, hold at will, and continue to learn. Most importantly, don’t lose what you can’t afford to. Good luck everyone.

From Wendy's to Tendies: A Story of how I got my ✋💎🤚,35,layfj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layfj4/from_wendys_to_tendies_a_story_of_how_i_got_my/,3,1612309139.0," I never really make ""story time"" posts like this, but it feels appropriate and cathartic today...

Once upon a time I made over a million dollars from a very early investment (off a Wendy's paycheck) into fairly well known digital *currency* (automod preventing the name). No, that's not where the money came from in my other posts. I lost that million, completely. I was wallstreetbets before this existed. I literally found out and learned about said *currency* from 4chan /b/. I lost it because when it peaked and fell, I sold for other *currencies*, then those fell. I didn't trust my gut. If I held I would have multi millions by today's price. That said... I didn't have my 💎👐 yet.

I got into GME because of extensive research throughout last year. I bought in and kept averaging since November. I liked Michael Burry's viewpoint, I like Ryan Cohen and believe he can do big things and I love games/tech. **Basically, I like this stock!**

I never once viewed this stock as a short squeeze play or anything like that. Being overly shorted was what made me confident I had a good entry point in a future value company, something the public had not yet accepted. People still thought it was brick-and-mortar only.

That said, Something smells.

There is plenty of DD on this sub and others, so I really don't need to restate things, but I'll briefly break it down...

\- The numbers here don't add up.

\- The volume and price don't make sense.

\- The story is still wrong (brick and mortar... how can they push this still)

\- The media lies (silver being pushed by reddit 😂)

I really have no true clue what the outcome will be. Everyone at this time is hoping for a short squeeze, and maybe it will come to that. I hope it does, that will be pretty fun to watch and maybe I'll get to be in the movie. But if it doesn't, do some other kinds of research, you might find that GME has a future outside of being a meme. Quite frankly it's NOT a meme, even now. So I knew I could do this, I knew I found my 💎👐.

**Stay strong, you might have a smooth brain but you have a strong gut! Believe in your gut and follow your conviction.**

Lastly a quote I read last year that feels appropriate now...

A note from Robinhood

Hi ***peasant***,  


We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?”   


We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   


To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [**a letter to our customers**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHh6lgFyOgotlCTJW8UC1di71-2FN8W9HLDeGxWC4U5aEavH91h1h75nfEoi40O-2BJp241os1OXbwqcvqJ1wx8fRtdZa4yPHJd3VaV9ZmuiW1Y8kqG-u_VSbrSSobEGTPbdwujPZ6fCGZKRRLLOA-2BpCz3BRV9-2BX49dRPtD-2F2U7b9PgqrVXf5DKO-2BnhZaxCe59ia9Z3PS4NjHJKlXzVtGOalHGANOqVJJmNOIgc5cQTGPiJB5YVddfZumB-2BRzgsOlubtDwP65Cl7RLwL-2BvmShfY9RqFI9BPat009NPfcuCw8JYxeeWLgj3cS0EWBKbLS9aAGDKkZSc6ZiQXlJBltu6FYIudbn23CHUZQgQ8BSxJP4Sfa0JRgQqP9HIxIKj0COn4BpubsQaKNruEHxZeK03pFX1ByYlg1g5C1wF8qPOIq82f2em3IIg) and captured the key understandings for you below:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [**volatility**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHmU2zwU4-2BFOOGZok1-2F2HV-2Fzt4c20N8xojDAhUgt8a3TK7RBIb22WdVUS4CSdTwvVnbL52f-2Bl-2B207nVUod7i4WaLCWuNNQ0d6ZEsoYQX1fJMiDjMpPyfpE5mx0X2MvnOeoHr6A6U-2FzwqHV0iErJeKPLQ-3DO9jx_VSbrSSobEGTPbdwujPZ6fCGZKRRLLOA-2BpCz3BRV9-2BX49dRPtD-2F2U7b9PgqrVXf5DlGxhQFAGgdBDnB5w-2Ffv-2F8dkJThZbIJB98XOaSrU-2FZmiB791dLLV15oExq5zsitalJD0a84ww9yljvdjSusBZYHElT-2Bc3GqQ1O6QdSRk-2BMdfCsNNYYjyjj1J5YidBztCuaqH47cE3xRkRaesw2Xn6kqB9e2Q2vPGfQqQYgE5LrYMWoVcgqMQRqZrA83tOKsnpO7SxLJM3XMy9RD9hv7svW7zlrzTtbg1dbC4jgKA4nGmJVFTp4bTWwccVDlB-2BfrNv) in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds**. 

We hope you take away this: **at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets**. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.  


Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.Sincerely,  
The Robinhood Team",2021-02-03 01:38:51

I am honestly trying to get others' points of view on these.

**1) Why is Ryan Cohen Silent?**

Opinion: He doesn't want the risk of potential market manipulation

**2) Why hasn't GameStop issued shares?**

Opinion: They think it will go higher.  At this point, I don't see any reason this company should not issue shares if they want to thrive long-term.

**3) Why is the price having 50 dollar swings in microseconds? See post by** u/MindF_ck

Opinion: The shorts are trying to trigger stop losses to buy shares. They are also trying to create artificial volatility so RH and others have an excuse to limit buying.

**4) Why isn't the SEC enforcing the ridiculous number of GME ""Fail-to-Deliver"" shares?**

Opinion: They haven't been pressured enough. See #DeliverTheShares on twitter to help the cause.

Revolut restricting $GME and $AMC trading,15,laylx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laylx5/revolut_restricting_gme_and_amc_trading/,1,1612309565.0," 

From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: **GME**) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: **AMC**) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  


### What does this mean for me?

You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  


For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.

### Why is this happening?

When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  


The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.  


This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

### When will they be available again to buy?

This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Why GME and AMC holders need to be looking at on balance volume to have an idea of what's going on with these volume and price movements. A little helpful DD,101,laylsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laylsx/why_gme_and_amc_holders_need_to_be_looking_at_on/,7,1612309559.0,"**Newbies**, skip this paragraph. **Non-newbies** (and people who actually bothered to do 5 minutes of research about volume price movements), the **tl;dr** is that the gradient for OBV is not proportional to the gradient of the price decrease, indicating a bullish divergence. 

I got a few PMs about my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laww2w/legit_proud_of_all_of_you_for_not_selling_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa. 

However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.

**But what are the statistics???**

In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of 1.1 billion, that's a factor of 0.5% and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.

These massive Trillion+ asset managers make the rules, they run the market. These are the same companies you willingly contribute money to monthly, paycheck after paycheck. By blindly giving your money to them every month, YOU AND I PERPETUATE THE CURRENT MARKET STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM THAT KEEPS 100s OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN DEBT SLAVERY, WHILE DENYING AMERICANS HEALTHCARE THAT WONT BANKRUPT THEM AND COST OF LIVING THAT DOESNT ALLOW THEM TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE. 

If millions of of GEN-Z, GEN-Y AND MILLENIALS  liquidate their holdings, take profits and sit on the sidelines, markets might wake up. 

Trillions of $ from 10s of millions of boomers and 10s of millions of younger Americans (Genz, millennials  etc) all go to passively buying and supporting the system boomers want you to support.

If you really want to stick it to the suits, pull your money from your 401k, park it in cash or a money market fund, actually stick it to the suits by not participating in the market. 

Taking down one smash and grab short-seller isn’t going to change anything. 

This will wake up the government that the young, the generations expected to shoulder the burden of the terrible economic, social and healthcare-related decisions made by PowerBoomer class, demand a more equal shake. We shouldn’t be expected to pay 5x what Boomers paid for their rent and housing, 20x what they paid for their education, 5x what they paid for cars and so much more. 

The lobbyists at Vanguard and Blackrock are smirking...great, they took down Melvin and exposed Citadel...but this will only increase their dominance, control and power over the markets. They pretend to care, pushing Environmental social governance BS and other strategies, but in reality, all they care about is the accumulation of power, via their capture of the US Gov’t, US Senators and Representatives and US capital markets",2021-02-03 01:45:41

Revolut in UK not letting me buy,11,layl90,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layl90/revolut_in_uk_not_letting_me_buy/,4,1612309522.0,"From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

What does this mean for me?

You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.

For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.

Why is this happening?

When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.

The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.

This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

When will they be available again to buy?

This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Naturally, I began to do some digging and I realized how stupid I was for not putting two and two together. The only correct response to us has to be a hissy fit by dominant mass media outlets. They are owned by huge players with big financial interests in the market. Being profit-making corporations, they must cater to the financial interests of the owners at the end of the day so of course, they would lash out in an attempt to mitigate the financial downside to their masters. 

My point here is that if we had grown up rich and gotten greedy then some mouthbreathers came out of the woodwork and called me out for my illegal immoral actions, we would lash out too.

For all of you who are considering buying in or buying the dip, does it not make sense that as long as trading restrictions are in place, the price will continue to fall?

Therefore, if you were going to buy in, would it not make more sense to wait for restrictions to be lifted? Especially given that the amount of available shares being traded right now is ridiculously low so if the shorts were to try and cover now they would still not be able to.

Anyway I'm just a fellow retard, so if someone would like to explain why I'm wrong about this, please go ahead.

if you have GME, hold

if you're planning to buy, wait

My favorite paragraph from the Mark Cuban AMA this morning,31,layk95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layk95/my_favorite_paragraph_from_the_mark_cuban_ama/,4,1612309456.0,"*In response to someone asking why the stocks are falling this morning*

Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular


So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.",2021-02-03 01:44:16

I wasn’t originally going to say anything prior to reading Mark’s AMA but since he brought it up I thought I’d just confirm. 

It’s true. Hedge funds have been shorting GME this entire time. Especially on the way up. Though I can’t say for the really big names like Melvin, my dad used to work in this industry and his friends still manage and own some smaller hedge funds. These past weeks they’ve been basically gloating to him about shorting the stock as it kept hitting all time highs. They think we’re idiots and are capitalizing on all of this waiting for us to fumble. 

Considering I don’t have literal phone records of these conversations I get why many of you might not believe me but for those of you who care I thought I’d share. 

Anyway...

Two days to the biggest battle of our ape lives. All comes down to today, and either, we heal as a team, or we're gonna crumble.

Drop by drop, dip by dip. Until we're finished.   We're in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And, we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell... one dollar at a time.

Now I can't do it for ya, I'm too broke. I look around, I see these rich faces and I think, I mean, I've made every wrong choice a middle-aged ape can make. I, uh, I've pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who's ever told me to sell. And lately, I can't even stand the number I see in my portfolio.   You know, when you get old, in life, things get taken from you. I mean, that's... that's... that's a part of life.

The dollars we need are everywhere around us. They're in every dip we buy, every minute, every second. On this team, we fight for that tendie . On this subredit we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that tendie . We claw with our fingernails for that tendie.  Because we know when add up all those tendies, that's gonna make the fucking difference between being rich and being hungry ! Between living and dying! I'll tell you this, in any fight, it's the guy who's willing to buy who's gonna win that tendie.

And I know, if I'm gonna have any life anymore it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that tendie, because that's what living is.

Now I can't make you do it. You've got to look at the guy next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think ya going to see a guy who will buy that dip with you. You are  gonna see a retarded ape who will sacrifice himself for this team, because he knows when it comes down to it your gonna do the same for him.   That's a team, gentlemen, and either, we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That's the stock market guys, that's all it is. Now, what are you gonna do?""",2021-02-03 01:44:09

I'm in this. I hardly knew why, but I am. It must be said that I initially just wanted to pocket. Yea sure, fuck the system and all and I liked what this stood for, but I honestly wanted to get in, grab some for myself, and get out. 

Well. Now I can't sell. I can't bring myself to do it. And it doesn't hurt, YET. 
I see now that it will only hurt if we lose. I don't want to lose to the HF, not my money. If we win, I don't care about the money. A lot of us put up a cost to fight. I'm paying mine. But if it's all for nothing and we all crumble and sell, that's where the real loss lies now. 

It isn't 2008, it's 2021. They've only gotten richer since. They have all the tools at their disposal to fuck us, more than they did in 2008, and they're fucking with us  I don't want to lose. I don't think how they're causing us to lose is legal, so that pisses me off. 

Let's fucking win. For the cost of all of us monke-headed diamond balls, saddle your keister back in that gorilla and ride with us. 

I'm ready to lose if it means we win.",2021-02-03 01:43:29

I was 18 when that happened and it tore me up to watch it. By now we all know the story of the excessive risk taking and the bailouts of banks. There's never any consequences for them. I still feel the anger when I think of the pain we went through for their greed.

This whole GME boondoggle has a similar ring to it. Large fund tries to short a company into the ground, selling more shares than are in existence with hopes that they bust the company and no one ever finds out how many of those shares were real and how many were fake. DFV and WSB picks up on it and what does the fund do? They double fucking down (excessive risk taking). Why? Because they need GME to go bankrupt. Never mind the lives ruined by demolishing the company. The company in this scenario is GME but this tactic is used across the board on a daily basis with no regard to the effect they're having on peoples lives. 

I don't care if my position goes to $0. I'm in this to keep this in the headlines and to drive change. SEC needs to start looking at selling shares naked. SEC needs to put regulations on swapping failed to deliver shares resting the clock for funds. SEC needs to investigate why we weren't allowed to trade this stock.

Revolut (DriveWealth) is restricting buying of GME and AMC from 02/02/21. Read the email i just received below. They are essentially doing what Robinhood did last week.,30,layipu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layipu/revolut_drivewealth_is_restricting_buying_of_gme/,6,1612309356.0,"“Trading Update for GME & AMC
Hi,

From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.

What does this mean for me?
You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.

None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.

For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.

Why is this happening?
When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.

The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.

This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.

When will they be available again to buy?
This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Team Revolut”

Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.

Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.

If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.

I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop.",2021-02-03 05:28:51

SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.**

Alright guys and gals, I know that the very essence of this sub is meant for circlejerking the massive gains and losses that only the truest ~~gambling addicts~~ geniuses of the stock market have cooked up over time, but most of you need a reality check.

Calm down, gay bears. I'm talking about you too. Put your bear dicks back in your bear pants and listen up.

Here's the reality of the situation: *nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out*. Unless we've got some Ms. Cleo ass motherfucker out there with tomorrow's lottery numbers and the Superbowl results in the palm of their hand, there's not one person who can definitively say how this is going to go.

When you jump on here looking for reassurance of your position, you're going to find that. It's called confirmation bias. If you think GME is going to the moon still, you'll see that. If you think GME stock is about to be sold next to the discount toilet paper and $1 pregnancy tests at the local Dollar Tree, then you're going to see that too.

I probably don't need to tell you that you shouldn't have spent your life savings to buy into a meme stonk at its height. That's just some free general life advice. Since you're reading this, though, let's assume that you did, and you're currently trying to decide between $ROPE and $BRIDGE. Take a breath and calm down. There *is* evidence of short laddering. There *is* evidence that the volume here strongly favors buying. It's entirely possible that they're actually setting themselves up for a massive resurgence.

On the other hand, it's also very possible that this stock is well and truly toast. As much as I've enjoyed watching the comradery around here and the exultation of the truly retarded among us, some of you need to face the reality that there are millions of subs here and only thousands of comments. There are plenty-- plenty-- of people who hopped in at $50 and cashed out at $500. If you think the *only* factor in the steady price decrease since last Thursday is Melvin, then I have bridge to sell you (but please don't jump off it- come on, you can always make more money, but you only get one life).

Do you know why it feels so good to be a part of this, no matter what side you're on? Two reasons: one, social cohesion, which most of us have been missing for a long fucking time because of this shitass pandemic. Two, psychologists have known for decades that unexpected rewards trigger a much higher release of sweet, sweet dopamine and serotonin. When you don't know for sure a good thing is going to happen, and then it does, it literally feels better than when you are expecting a good thing to happen and then see it come to fruition. This is why gambling is addictive. And if this is your first time being introduced to the addiction centers in your brain, well, welcome aboard- hopefully it has been a lesson for you of the good and bad power of your own mind and what it can do.

So again...could GME still moon? Yes. Could it crash and burn? Yes. Both of those circumstances require the right combination of factors to happen. If you're sitting here all day staring at the chart and tearing your hair out-- stop. For real, stop. Close the tab. Go outside. Go hug your wife or her boyfriend and tell them you love them. 

You have already paid the admission price for this ride, so you may as well ride it. If you can't take the heat and want/*need* to sell because you have a life to live, then do that if that's what you need to do. Don't hang on just because some rando on the internet posted some fucking gorilla emojis. On the other hand, if you consider your investment to be money you were truly willing to lose and want to see how this plays out, then that could be fun too. It really *could* rally. It's not over just yet, but you gotta fucking be honest with yourself about your limits and tolerances here. 

Apes together strong, but billionaire hedge funds also strong. Do your *own* research, come to your *own* conclusions, and quit sucking on the hopium/dreadium teat long enough to make a decision on what to do from here.

Edit: forgot my positions: 36 GME @ 99.7, not planning on selling but *I can afford the price of this ride*.",2021-02-03 05:21:31

Part of the vision of GME's future is their takeover of the esports industry. It could be a lounge for casual/competetive gaming, a training studio, and of course, a retail giant for all kinds of games, collectibles?, and PC's. What do you need for this? Space. Dave & Buster's already has the infrastructure - hell, they've already done 3/4 of the work for you. All GME has to do is some light renovations/remodeling, add/remove games, and change the signs (what kind of name is ""Dave & Buster's"" anyway?). Gamestop....I mean D&B... also has food/drink, areas for the kiddos to play, and is a spot to go watch live events (MMA/Boxing, Superbowl, etc). More revenue streams for GME.

&#x200B;

PLAY's market cap is currently 1.62B. There are 140 locations (89 currently open from a quick google search). The others are currently shut down due to Covid, so it would be a perfect time to start renovation on those. Many of these locations are in Malls (can't find the exact number). Malls may seem like they are dying, and many of the stores in them are. I believe malls are here to stay, but they won't exist as the retail experience we remember from our childhood. Many malls are still thriving, and those that are have adapted to become experiential social zones, with retail as an added bonus.

Many of you got way too invested in the hype of the idea of a short squeeze and bought more than you can financially handle in the long and short term.

If you really believe in your stock, and love it, and love the movie theater experience and that weird smell when you're walking down the blue carpet with weird little multicolored squiggly lines. And you love the in-person experience of trading in your console games for a dollar and playing crappy demos with the controller attached to a wall. AND love(d) playing brick breaker on the most underrated smartphone ever with that little scrolly ball thing instead of a touch screen, then **trade it as such**.

The stock market has recovered from every major crash in history (inflation-adjusted too) .

If you can't hold, you can't hold- but a great way to ensure break-even is to place a sell order for **half** your shares at, **at least** 2x the price bought at.

for those who have smoother brains than me (impossible) it means this:

""I bought 5000 XYZ shares at $10 and oh shit I need money to live long-term oops""

\- instead of blowing it all when XYZ is $6, place a limit sell order for **at least** $20 for 2500 XYZ which **should** ensure break even **if** it is filled (depending on brokerage fees). Let the other 2500 XYZ ride 'til you die. Obviously, you can hope the price will double in a day, but it's always good to make the limit order GoodTillCanceled so it doesn't expire after a day.

We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process. The business of short selling is to feed on death. You make sure you’re in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma. The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore. Even the night shift watch gets a payout. But they over reached this time and someone noticed. A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time. And they got asked, ‘hey, what’s in the needle?  Are you a doctor?’

There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control. Hopefully that means something to you. 

I’m thankful that my money was already in position. That I could join this gathering, and that through the worry of losing it all, that it could result in some oversight on a business of promoting a good company by investing in its future, not have its head cut off by the machete wielding bully right out in broad daylight.

WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?,12,lb3tz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3tz7/wsb_potential_for_activism_in_gme/,14,1612322205.0,"As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $7.2B market cap.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M but I'm wetahded.

So I titled this ""WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?"" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with **🚀**🦍🌈🐻💎🙌🏽.

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...

Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic.",2021-02-03 05:16:45

The hedge funds know they're fucked.

Theoretically each share could be worth an infinite amount of dollars. If no one sells, that's the price they'll have to pay. I think it's time these hedge funds billionaires lost their yachts and mansions and have to live in a normal house like the rest us. This is a moment where we're taking back what they took.

Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.

We all saw what happened, brokers fucking over their audience because of hedge funds, and they cite ""Volatility"" as an issue, in that case, all we have to do to be able to buy, is to hold, and the volatility will diminish.

Things is: if brokers allow buying, how high are we going to go? 

This is a discussion so we can see if GME is meant to moon after brokers allow buying , or if the short squeeze is dead.

Reverse gamma squeeze incoming,0,lb3hb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb3hb2/reverse_gamma_squeeze_incoming/,64,1612321326.0,"Hello fellow bag holders

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

**Position:** GME 19Feb21 110 P

WallStreetBets has become mostly $GME posts which is understandable because we are in  a  historical battle against hedge funds and every post can make a difference. But, WSB is not only about GME. Some people can't afford it and others don't want to invest in it anymore. So, I **propose making a flair or filtering system** for all new posts related to $GME to preserve  the quality of this SubReddit like it used to be in preWW3 phase.

WSB is much more than $GME and no matter how it ends, we still have other high quality posts buried underneath all of the $GME posts. Have people   forgotten how we raised $AMD and $TSLA from the ashes to what they  have  become today? and there are many other plays like that which we started  right here. **Bottom line is, This community shouldn't be reduced to a GME  only community because it's much more than that...**

EDIT:  Some Melvin type of bullshit is happening in here... This post was previously banned the first time it was posted. In addition, some comments are being hidden by the mods.

Today we have lost a comrade. Someone who has given everything he had to support us. Someone who believed in doing the right thing, and standing up for it.

I am talking about the ViKING.

On friday, he fought the short ladder rigorously. But their schemes have come to haunt him, and deal a devastating blow to him. Still, his spirit and wishes for a free market still exists in every single share you retards are holding preciously.

Make sure to pay him the respect he deserves. Also, make sure to stand your ground, no matter what. We may have lost this round, but as long as we do not falter, we are going to win the war and avenge our fallen brother. 

No matter what, do never accept being treated as the ‚little man‘. Fight. Even if it takes your last breath.

Take the last bit of spark left in your soul and turn it into a devastating fire.

Hold in this war and those to come.
Hold like you would hold your firstborn. Hold like there‘s no tomorrow.

If you’ve seen The Big Short you know what I mean. Wall Street, the SEC, rating agencies, the media, and politicians all collude to maintain power for themselves while we are left to fight in the dark for scraps. That’s why GME and WSB scared them so much. They are beginning to realize their grasp on power is slipping and are going to do it everything they can to take back control. 

Think back to the housing collapse and Occupy Wall Street. Wall Street broke the entire economy by offering as many loans as people would take, it didn’t matter if the person applying for their sixth housing loan was working part time at Wendy’s with $100k in student debt. They were making so much money, they didn’t care, and the revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC meant there was absolutely no accountability. Then comes Occupy, where idealist people came together and said ENOUGH! You can’t just destroy millions of families and then get bailed out for your trouble!

THIS SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE “ELITES”

They saw that the veil was briefly lifted and everyday people that they treated like retarded filth could see the corruption and that the system was corroded from the inside out. They knew that CLASS WARFARE was  coming and soon the plebs would kick out all of them from their ivory towers and rebuild the system to better suit the majority. They couldn’t allow this.

They needed to divide us so that we could be more easily controlled. This is when identity politics and intersectionality began to be pushed in our society and culture. Instead of us being divided between common people and the elites who control our system, we had to be divided based on race, gender, sexual orientation etc. so that THEY could maintain power as we squabbled amongst ourselves. Left and right alike our politicians SOLD US OUT. No matter what you think of Trump, he was a reaction to all of this, not the cause (although he did make the division much worse).

Now once again the veil has been lifted. We can see the blatant lies and misinformation pushed by the media to keep us at each other’s throats. We can see Janet Yellen has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking on Wall Street. That Jen Psaki’s brother is a portfolio manager at Citadel. That Wall Street will manipulate the markets right in front of our eyes and the SEC won’t lift a finger to do anything about it (unless it’s to regulate us retail traders).

The system has been broken for a long time and now that everyday people can see the corruption, they must stop us.

Well FUCK them! They just stirred the hornets nest and we WILL fight back and we WILL win. This is only the beginning. 

TLDR: the system has been corrupt and broken for decades but now everyday people can see it clearly. The elites in power are on borrowed time.

***Of course hold GME*** but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\*

I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI. 

1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore. 

2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.

# Market Caps

Expi- 8.4b

RDFN- 8.2b

Z- 34b

# Net income

Expi- Profitable

RDFN- Not profitable

Z- Not profitable

# Revenue

RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI

Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi

# Simpleton's Math

Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.

Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.

Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120

After a year of lurking in this sub, I've decided that it is finally my time to start a YOLO journey. Now, to make tendies in the future what do we need? That's right, fucking clean energy to cook my tendies of course. I don't want no tendies from fucking dirty oil and pollution, that shit's disgusting. Only boomers eat that tendies.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:

* ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.

[ICLN Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/5g9sw9hf14f61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec7ca2c10425c1a5de851872324fa0fe898c8e6)

* **But here's the catch**. Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -> more adoptions from the average households.

* Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.

GME Is currently valued at 7.94Bn USD

The gaming industry was valued at 151Bn in 2019 according to grand view research. 

GME made 6.3 Bn in revenue last year with no new consoles to sell. 

Now let’s compare this to Chewy. (You all know about Ryan Cohen). 

Chewy is currently worth 41.76Bn!!!!

The pet care market according to the same analyst is about 150.72Bn in 2019. (Was 131 in 2016 with a CAGR at 4.6%)

Chewy had a revenue of 6Bn last year. 

So what does this mean?????????

GME is fairly valued at 41Bn if not more. 

That translates to 591.92$ a share.

Short Sale Fails in a Nutshell - MM Perspective,91,lb300m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb300m/short_sale_fails_in_a_nutshell_mm_perspective/,9,1612320121.0,"Saw a lengthy write-up about 'shady' short failure coverage tactics so I wanted to update you guys on what that actually looks like in practice for a trader.  This is prefaced by the idea that traders hold stock proportionally against their positions to get **Delta Neutral**, so they are not making directional bets on what stock does.

In situations like GME, traders get extremely short stock through their positions as a result of trading the other side of what paper is doing.  As market makers they have short stock sale exemptions due to their status as a liquidity provider, meaning they can sell stock short in all conditions to allow them to continue trading and 'providing liquidity' in the options markets.  Due to this, they will often encounter a **FAIL** on their short stock position if the short float is big enough and it is difficult to acquire stock.  They are told by their clearing firm that they need to buy in a % of their short position by the end of the day, determined by the size of the fail.

A fail is considered a short term problem for these guys, so this requires a short term solution.  In some cases the traders will get long stock through a **CONVERSION**, where they buy put, sell call, buy stock.  While this seems like a cop out there is an entire market around how they price rev/cons depending on the expiration of the options and the interest rates being charged.

The other main method to get long stock is to **EXERCISE YOUR CALLS**.  Very often market makers will have large call positions as a result of natural trading, and many of these calls can be in the money at the time of a fail.  Due to how expensive it is to hold short stock against these very ITM calls it can make sense to exercise these early, as the savings from the short stock position outweigh the benefits of having the position open.  This is doubly true when you're using the exercise to cover a fail, as you save money by exercising the calls early and prevent yourself from having to make a disadvantageous trade to cover.

Additionally, the market maker may try and prioritize trades in the open market that get them long stock, but that is usually at the cost of putting on trades for bad prices.  This is probably the least favored option for that reason, as it is a long-term solution that is often the least cost-effective.

Now this mainly applies to traders who are short stock as a hedge on their positions, but hedge funds that are naked short likely use conversions to cover a fail as well.  As you can guess from the fact that you're using options to get synthetic short stock while buying long stock to cover your fail, you will still be on the hook when those options expire.  Additionally, this **COSTS MONEY**.  Aint no freebies allowed in the trading world, so whoever you're trading those conversions with is taking their pound of flesh while you're putting a band-aid on your other boo-boo.  If the stock remains very hard-to-borrow and at a decent price level long term you'll continue to make the firms eat shit on their short stock, even if the price doesn't moon in the near future.

TLDR - covering your fails short term with options still costs money; if you keep holding, they keep paying",2021-02-03 04:42:01

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

$MACE - Mace Security International DD,7,lb2zc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb2zc6/mace_mace_security_international_dd/,13,1612320080.0,"My first DD post. Sources in comments.

tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $*MACE* having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%. Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Longer Version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today I’ll share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.

Guns in USA – Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and here’s why:

· We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers… People will want to protect themselves – pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.

· Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.

· All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.

· Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this: **Source 1**

· Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this won’t go down so smoothly. When there’s anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.

In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $*MACE*, one of the old timers in this industry.

**Company**: Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. [https://www.mace.com/](https://www.mace.com/)

**History:** Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point – $*MACE* had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (**Source 2**). Old management team neglected company’s online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.

**Now**: new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (**Source 3**, **Source 4**)

Check out their amazon shop – has lots of positive reviews.

When searching for ‘best pepper spray’, ‘best animal deterrent’ I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.

**Latest Financial Results**: Q3 2020

Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.  
Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.  
SG&A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.  
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (1.4 cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).  
From earnings call transcript: **Source 5** (I recommend to go through it – gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)

**Recent Catalyst**: Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, ‘2021 OTCQX Best 50‘ award (**Source 6**), one-year $2.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap: **Source 7**)

**Upcoming $*****MACE*** **Catalysts**: New product launch in Q1 2021 (mentioned in call transcript above), FY 2020 results (which due to all recent political tensions should show even better results than those reported for Q2 and Q3)

**Upcoming Industry Catalysts**: Personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%:

$*MACE* just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.

Summary: I don’t expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $*MACE* trade in $1.5-$2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year.

[GME] - Past Week in Review,0,lb2zbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb2zbw/gme_past_week_in_review/,51,1612320079.0,"Guys, I was a firm believer in the squeeze until I finished my DD last night. I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

>""GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow… short it he told me. ""

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

>If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares.",2021-02-03 04:41:19

TTCF Long and Potential Earnings Play,13,lb2xym,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb2xym/ttcf_long_and_potential_earnings_play/,9,1612319980.0,"I came across an article about BYND where the author suggested that TTCF (Tattooed Chef)  is a competitor to BYND. Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didn’t know, Beyond Meat’s ingredients lists are longer than your wife’s boyfriend’s dick, and health-conscious people don’t like that. TTCF pushes a more “farm to table” notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way. 

Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of 3.1M for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and 4.88M for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a “non-recurring” expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad. 

Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (1.65B compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY ½ THAT OF BYND (41M compared to 94.44M). 

Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions haven’t jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too. 

I have a long position as well as 3/19 $30c and  3/19 $25c.",2021-02-03 04:39:40

I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I’m excited about, and I’d love some feedback.

&#x200B;

People that are trading for the first time(s): When we start out we do this thing where we get some small profits (the lucky ones do at least) and then we think without respecting the big daddy in the room that shall later be named: 

""Hey, this shit is easy! I can probably earn conservatively like 1% a day and I will be set for life in X years.""

*Menawhile...*

*Narrator: ....HE COULD NOT.*

&#x200B;

Then, in a stroke of genius we think: ""Ha! I am being greedy, I should be smart. I can EASILY make 0.5% a day and then I will be set in 2X years, but that is fine! Lol... those suckers that don't have any patience...""

&#x200B;

And at every step you find out you really are way shittier at this trading thing than you previously thought. To either one or the other happens. You quit, or the market just whoops your ass so fucking hard with money that your greedy ass could not afford to lose that you actually learn something for a change.

Markets are brutal and merciless my dudes and gals.

&#x200B;

The big daddy in the room I mentioned before it is called TIME. We want things fast and they usually happen slower than we'd like. We get anxious and then that magic button... MARGIN starts seeming like an appealing shortcut. You no longer need to wait for the market to move THAT much, you can have it move 10 times less than that and make the same money. That is another trap.

&#x200B;

Look. I am not an investor. I am mostly a gambler that tells himself he is an investor because I have some sweet REIT dividends dropping in my account every month and once made 130% blindly trading creepto. Markets are brutal and you should only put in what you are comfortable losing. Not just in GME but anything with a short(ish) time frame in mind.

&#x200B;

To answer the post title's question: You most likely cannot time the market going down RELIABLY than you can time it going up. You might get lucky. But don't attribute that to confidence. Anyone can be right on a casino where the bets are only GREEN or RED and nothing else. The thing is being right most of the time, and I certainly cannot help you with that. But if you put the time in, study something for a change and allow yourself to pay ""the market's tuition"". You just might make it.

(sorry to hijack top comment)

To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»
This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to HOLD this is precisely what they fucking meant. TO FUCKING HOLD. THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, patience is key. Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): «Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to HOLD! This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to HOLD! This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to FUCKING KEEP HOLDING.

JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?

MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE

Mudrick Capital Management earned 9.8% in January, one of
its best months ever, making the bulk of its gains on debt and equity options of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The firm also profited from the volatility in shares of GameStop Corp.
The $3.1 billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said. A spokesman for New York-based Mudrick declined to comment.

My $10k buy put me up to 84 shares, at an average cost of $300. This was a lot of money for me -- the most I've ever risked on one trade -- but it's not so big that it would change my life if I lost it. 

The way I see it, it makes no sense to fold now. In poker terms, I'm pot committed: 

For simplicity's sake, I'm imagining only two ""bad"" out comes:

* **A.** no squeeze ever happens, and it goes to $5 -> I wind up with $400 at the end.
* **B.** a squeeze happens, and I'm so dumb I completely miss it, but manage to cash out (or just hold) afterward at $500. -> I wind up with $40k at the end.

Subtract the money I could ""save"" by folding now, and I lose about 9k in scenario A, and make about 30k in scenario B. 

Even in this simple ""pessimistic"" model, if I believe there is at least a 33% chance that scenario B happens, I have a positive expected value here, and I should stay in. If I believe the price will go to $1000,  I only need a need a 13% chance of a squeeze to justify staying, and so on.

I think that's pretty much the situation that a lot of people here are in: it'll hurt to lose, but nowhere near as much as it will rock to win. So why would any of us back down?

The \*only\* thing I wish I'd done differently (other than getting in 2 months ago :D) is applying some dollar cost averaging when I bought, and broken it into a $1k purchase every hour. Assuming the ladder attack played out the same way, I would have wound up with more shares. (No ladder attack, and I'd be in the same position as I am now because the price wouldn't have dropped -- or if I missed the squeeze at some point, I might have fewer shares, but I'd still be enjoying the squeeze...)

Anyway, this isn't meant as financial advice. Just something I wish I'd thought through earlier...

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

I just wanted to post some encouragement.  This is actually my first post on Reddit.  I got an account long ago to join r/freefolk after the disappointing end of Thrones.  Good or bad.  Agree or disagree.  That forum taught me the power of the internet.  I decided in August of this year that I needed to take control of my own financial future.  That, win or lose, I should own it.  I bought some regular stocks.  Got my Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.  Stuff I believed in.  Then I started learning things.  My risk tolerance grew.  I learned I liked some digital currencies I can’t mention and got in with what funds I could back in September as they started to climb.  They treated me well.  I started following other subreddits like this one in the background.  I was thirsty to learn and willing to lose some money (and make it if the gods smiled).  I’ve followed the logic with these stocks.  This is all a gamble.  I know that.  What has been exposed to the mainstream is that it’s all a gamble.  I think the “experts” hate that the most.  But this is a damn good gamble.  I missed the boat to get on GME last week but I jumped into as much AMC as Robinhood would let me.  I’ve eaten my shirt on it but I continue to hold with diamond fucking hands.  I’m recently divorced and on my own.  There’s a lot I could do with that money.  It’s nothing I can’t afford to lose but I could use it elsewhere.  I won’t.  It’s to the moon or to the ground.  I thought I missed the GME bandwagon for good but then it started dropping.  I almost let the naysayers get to me and didn’t go in.  I’m already eating it on AMC but you know what?  I’M IN AND I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!  Bought this morning at 114. Only a couple of shares but it’s what I can do.  I want on this rocket with you.  We go to the moon or crash together.

"Aphria/Tilray Merger Arbitrage Opportunity, Plus APHA vs. CGC",94,lb255a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb255a/aphriatilray_merger_arbitrage_opportunity_plus/,65,1612317974.0,"Well my fellow degens, I have an interesting one for you. Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

Is it not possible that shorts have been covering during the short ladder bottoms and popping it back up (today’s especially) to cover and then re-shorting the stock to profit as it drops?

Why holding GME will cause $rope to gamma squeeze,0,lb223q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb223q/why_holding_gme_will_cause_rope_to_gamma_squeeze/,55,1612317769.0,"
Since my last comments got buried, I figured I’d do my autists who haven’t gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It’s long so strap in kiddos. 


The squeeze is over. It’s happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won. 


Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number. 


This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let’s get one thing straight. Wsb’s greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don’t give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they’re going to cover from 400 to 200. 


So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they’ve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos. 


Now here’s where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who’s held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don’t realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they’re under no pressure besides laughable interest rates. 


In a way, it’s actually beautiful. You’re all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It’s wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you’re all just bidding against each other and there’s not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit. 


Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it’s the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they’re lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It’s pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam’s razor it you tards. You’re all bagholding for “ideals” and “justice”. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these vampire fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.

Per Cuban's AMA I agree strongly that Robinhood's buying restrictions have hurt the momentum. They are going to have the same liquidity issue again and again as the price is driven up. It's a deadlock.

Fidelity and Vanguard have access to assets that make RH look like an ant in comparison and they will have no problem backing you up.

Shut the fuck up. A free brokerage was too good to be true and WSB should have known better. But we didn't. And now we're paying the price of being reliant on an institution which can't or won't support us. It doesn't matter *why* this happened, it did and it will again.

Open a Fidelity account and wire money into it. You could be up an running in a day or two. BTFD and hold. This is a prolonged war on an unimaginably powerful and resourceful institution. It was never going to be all sunshine and rainbows with a victory parade after. It's going to take weeks and it's going to be hard. Think of today not as the end, but as a lost battle where we now know we need to make a strategic retreat. The war is not over.

200 shares and holding.

edit: Hold the shares you do have in RH. I don't foresee problems selling them (150 of my shares are there so I hope to hell we won't), and it could take 2 weeks to move them. You don't want your shares inaccessible for 2 weeks.

Theory vs Practice,59,lb1ujn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1ujn/theory_vs_practice/,32,1612317275.0,"Not a bot trying to get anyone to sell or take another position, just a smooth brained autist with a thought... 

So, what we've all seen over the last two weeks is the short squeeze ""theory"" at play. We watched the shorts try to cover, the price came up as it should, the massive buy frenzy, and we're holding. The mechanics of the market at play, and in a truly free market, things were working as everyone theorized they should. Now comes the practice of stopping our ability to buy, gamma squeezes, ladder attacks, etc. The point is, whatever we think ""should"" happen, can be defeated by the simple fact that we're playing this game on someone else's field, and its their ball. 

The theory is that they will have to cover at some point, but do they have to do it in the way we all expect? The evidence shows they do not right now. They have so much power they can get away with dirty tactics to cover their asses. It seems like what ""should"" happen, isn't going to because ***this isn't a fair fight***. 

**Cuban says he would hold, so we hold. DFV looks like he's gonna hold, so we hold. We hold because we want to on our own volition. I'm not selling, and I'm not backing down.** 

But, maybe its time we shift our perspective from ""buy whatever we can and hold, because they have to cover"" to getting down and dirty and fighting them with their own tactics... what that means? I don't know I'm just a retard with a drool bib. We've gone from an active position of being able to buy the momentum and rally, to a passive one. Yes it has been forced on us due to the buy limits and price manipulation, but we can't let that stop us. Lawsuits don't matter, its cheaper to pay fines and settle than go bankrupt. What can we even do? Are we stuck buying and holding? I mean I'm in, I can handle the pressure, but most people bought in really high and are about to lose everything again if things don't work out in our favor. I'm not running scared, I'm a realist the price HAS to come down and stay down at some point. Is now that point? Even if it spikes hard and we see the moon fly by on our warp speed trajectory to infinity, they will chop our knees out from under us to stop that from happening. 

I guess what I'm trying to say, we might have to pivot our strategy and play dirty to actually win this. I'm not advocating anything illegal. This is not investment advice.

The psychology of having Diamond Hands,621,lb1r4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1r4z/the_psychology_of_having_diamond_hands/,80,1612317056.0,"Sup retards. You're reading this which means one of two things. You either think you have Diamond hands, and want to know how that happened, or two, you're afraid your hands may be turning into paper and want to know how to stop it from happening. Luckily I'm here to provide some non-investment related advice that you can apply to all facets of your life.

Some smart people a long time ago did a study of some kids. They put a cookie in front of the kids and said ""if you don't eat the cookie, I'll give you another cookie at the end."" Then they left the room. Know what happened? Some kids ate the cookie, some kids didn't. Stocks are cookies we own, in a way. And if we hold onto them and don't eat the cookie now, we get more cookies later.

So what was the difference between the kids who ate the cookie now, and the kids who got all the cookies later? Some kids would stare at the cookie. watch it, Obsess over it like it was their fucking Precious. They would hold the cookie, turn it over and look at the other side, maybe lick the cookie. Their world became the cookie for the duration of that experiment.

Other kids distracted themselves. Hid the cookie under the plate, played games with their hands, some kids took a nap.

Guess which kids ate the cookie before the time was up? That's right, the kids who just watched the cookie the whole damn time. Those kids worked soo hard to have diamond hands, and fucked it up for themselves. The other kids took a break and relaxed and got the extra cookies in the end.

What can you learn from this? Out of sight, out of mind. If you really need to have diamond hands and you're not sure if you can do it, take a break. Unplug. And I really mean distract yourself fully. Disengage. When you're done upvoting this shit close reddit and go for a walk. Don't just stop staring at the ticker, I mean really move your brain onto another topic. If it helps, set a 2-hour timer and only check in 2-hour increments.

It's the minute-to-minute drama your mind will be weak to. It caused me to paper hand at the worst possible minute last Thursday. Of course I got right back in when I could though. But if I had taken a shit or something instead of getting obsessed with watching the line go up and down, I'd be much richer than I am right now.

So learn something from those kids, retards. And have diamond-hands by not even trying. Success is inevitable.

**Edit: TL;DR:**

Smart kids stop staring at the cookie, ended up getting another cookie. Dumb kids obsessed over the ticker all day and paper-handed when things got too scary.",2021-02-03 03:50:56

&#x200B;

# To win this battle we have to think LONGER TERM here:

HFs can afford to carry their shorts for MONTHS before it becomes truly unprofitable for them. But they are still paying to be in that position. You on the other hand can carry your shares TIL THE DAY YOU DIE and you will get dividends for doing so. 

I know most of you have never seen a floppy disk or tube television in your life but let me tell you something. LET TIME DO THE WORK FOR YOU.

&#x200B;

# Think less like a trader and more like a SHAREHOLDER:

Instant gratification is great but know what else is great? A big fucking I TOLD YOU SO down the line.

Buy the stock. Buy at GameStop. Help their earnings. Arguably you are doing more of a favor to the endgame of this by buying **at** GameStop than buying **GameStock**. Hold the stock like a boomer because while valuations might tell you it is overpriced, fact is that the shorts push valuation UP because in the end they are BUYERS of the stock at some point, and see #1 about time working in your favor...

Go to a boomer mindset. It is the right tool for the job.

# 

# If you cannot have fun watching the whole thing. You probably have too much money on the line...

Kinda obvious ain't it? But here is my advice... if you can't handle the heat. Don't put any more money into it. If you still can't handle it. Be humble and accept that this is not healthy for you and exit at a loss. Mind you, that selling low and buying high is a motto for a reason. 

Go out (to your yard because pandemic), make some love with your hand, go out and then make love with your hands. The possibilities are endless. There is a world out there outside the stock market you know. Just 💎🖐🏻 by default by not looking at your portfolio all day. Set a limit order on pluto if you must to feel at ease. I know I do.

And even if you are not comfortable with buying GME now. Even if you paperhands don't allow you to be in peace with your position. At least go on to spend some of what you liquidate on a GameStop store near you. And then let's watch Q1 numbers rolling in together!",2021-02-03 03:49:15

What do we know about RH and Citadel?  Citadel buys more information from RH than any other customer.  They're also an investor.  I'm not sure exactly what data they purchase/are privy to, but I cannot imagine it does not include a potential liquidity crisis should certain events in the market take place.  Remember how u/DeepFuckingValue was telling us to be aware of increased short activity back in early December as it would be an attempt to drive the share price down?  Are we supposed to believe that some of the most sophisticated financial institutions on Earth did not notice something and start making contingency plans?

Here's what I want to know from Robinhood, preferably in a situation where they're under oath:

1. At what point were they aware of a potential liquidity crisis?
2. What steps did they take to increase deposits on hand once they started to see user movement towards heavily shorted stocks on their platform?
3. Who is in charge of their risk management strategy?  Where was this person during the past few months?

**And finally, the most important question:**

**4) At what point was Citadel informed that Robinhood** ***might*** **be required to limit buys of GME due to liquidity requirements if events unfolded a certain way**

**TLDR:** I don't think Citadel ever had to tell RH to do anything because they already knew what was coming.",2021-02-03 03:41:38

Understanding Short Interest: The most important post you will downvote all day.,45,lb1fh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1fh0/understanding_short_interest_the_most_important/,81,1612316249.0,"# Short-interest ratio is:

* the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.
* This is often called the ""days-to-cover ratio"" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions **IF THE PRICE GOES UP**

# EILI5

* a stock has a short interest of 4 shares
* average daily volume of shares traded is 20
* 20/4 = 5 this would mean 5 days to cover

&#x200B;

# What is Short Selling?

&#x200B;

* Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.
* It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.
* You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.
* **If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, you realize a gain.**

What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400 even...What is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.

# If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $74.22 the very bottom of the day.....maybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profit....and sold to all of you who thought you were ""buying the dip""

Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short squeeze...look at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $300...why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.

You really only have 3 options at this point:

1. Make money
2. Make a ton of money
3. Lose money

So how do these 3 come into play?

1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is.
2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this.
3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.  Your wife's boyfriend won't even let you smell his taint anymore.

The choice is yours.  I'm in it to further fuk hegdies, make tendies, and aspire to be DFV.  I'll take option 2.",2021-02-03 03:34:36

Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).  
Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the 
hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking **HOLD**. 


**How to move your shares:**

It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.

After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here: https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry) and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage,
except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME. 

In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.

Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.

Edit: 

More info on DRS ""DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or “street” form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuer’s records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor.""",2021-02-03 03:32:40

Don’t give up! Like Braveheart.

This is dangerous emotional trading that can lead to hold the bag to GME $0.

&#x200B;

Yes, it may go to $0.    That's why we're all here.

Sure, HF's were stupid to short GME at $5,

but yes, the dumb shorts were right, GME has stores in malls.   

Dur dur.  Steam means download games

&#x200B;

Now that WSB'ers are underwater, they get to play mental anguish of ""Take losses or hold bag?""

Hope and pray is not a plan.

Stock may never get back to $200.   The stock does not care that you bought at $200.

Insane options will expire worthless and 100% loss on those trades.

ICLN: What’s behind the $10M options play,38,lb15mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb15mz/icln_whats_behind_the_10m_options_play/,24,1612315588.0,"I bought to open 611 Jan 23 call options on ICLN at $45 today at $5.7 at a cost of around $350k. This was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19,261 contracts bought since Friday. 

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds. Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available ($45) in recent days. 

Why? IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED (from low of $8) in past year with top holding (PLUG) up 1800%+ in past year. 

If ICLN “only” doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of ~80%, $5.8 options @45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry. 

And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy (the US joined this wave with Biden’s plan). TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks. As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year. 

So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus + TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns.",2021-02-03 03:26:28
WSB is being short attacked by hedgies. All of our favourites are under attack and tripped SSR today. This isn't a coincidence.,447,lb15al,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb15al/wsb_is_being_short_attacked_by_hedgies_all_of_our/,74,1612315566.0,"It's my opinion that these hedgies didn't liquidate long positions in order to cover shorts just yet, but instead to short all of our favourites in order to pay for the impending squeeze and recoup losses.

Look at AMC, BB, NOK, PLTR, etc. All of them were shorted hard and fast this morning, and once SSR was tripped they setup sell pressure walls to hold that price until they can short into the bid again. *Overcoming this wall requires a lot of buy volume that just isn't there right now, we're spread to thin.*

Remember that SSR is tripped when shorted beyond 10%, and for the remainder of that trading day and the following trading day the shorter's can only sell above the strike. This is also known as the uptick rule. 

It's almost as if there was some kind of backroom meeting to coordinate an effort to short our most mentioned and beloved tickers. A lot of these hedge funds would have shorted BlackBerry when it was at $10, so why wouldn't they liquidate positions in their longs and short it when it is at 22? For those unaware, shorter's make money by keeping the difference between the strike they sold the borrowed chair at and the strike they purchase it back at minus of course fees and interest. Allowing them to push this stuff down is making them money. 

There's strength in unity, let's stop fighting them on 5 fronts, and make them come to us on one. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Dont buy Silver. Stay with GME.,1548,lb14nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb14nk/dont_buy_silver_stay_with_gme/,61,1612315522.0,"Alright fellow Monkeys listen here. I found a great quote on [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.

""Here’s An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, let’s say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let’s say you short 10 shares of stock. 

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what’s called “cover your short position” by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share. 

It’s crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it’s considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited.""

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

EDIT 1: If you want to check my source feel free! According to [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) the two most shorted stocks to watch are #1 GME and #2 AMC.

It’s Time to Fight in the Mud,403,lb0sci,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0sci/its_time_to_fight_in_the_mud/,68,1612314693.0,"Can’t you autists see? The game has changed.

Hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest, **it is not.** Here is why.

A short squeeze results from a low availability of shares. The price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze, and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze.

Hedge funds need a lot of shares, and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money. They do, however, have a lot of money. Hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged. **But the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest**

Driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares. Once the amount of free floating shares is too low, hedge funds panic much like the VW short squeeze. For the price of one share on Friday (~$330) you could have purchased 4 shares today (~$82). Hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money, but we can fight back when they are cheap.

Furthermore, allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further. Let them drive the price down, let them trigger that rule and then load up.

Slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds, and they will have no choice but to cover. That is when you get to name your price, everything in between is just for show.

I am not a financial advisor, nor a professional by any means. All information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical. I am retarded. I own GME shares.

It's Friday, the sun is peaking through the curtains and you're eating your Weetabix with no worries on your mind. You're content.

You sold your GME shares at small loss at the start of the week as you continued to watch the share price plummet due to market manipulation. You got out, you survived. 

It's 9:28am, you're returning from the school run. Your BMW 1 series seats make you feel safe and important. Your house, although small, is affordable and the mortgage repayments don't put too much pressure on your paper wallet. 


Your phone goes off as you enter the house. You sit on the sofa and turn on NBC as you open Whatsapp. You have 17 unread messages. 


Your eyes pan up, the news anchor is shouting. You read the title at the bottom of the screen - 'The Short Squeeze Is Happening"". Jim Cramer is crying. You quickly open your Whatsapp group chat and only see dollar signs being spammed by your friends. You open Yahoo Finance and see the share price at 600.87, it's still rising. Your heart skips a beat. You open I-phone calculator and work out that your 17 shares would now be worth just over 10,000 US dollars. You feel sick.


The share price is still rising. You receive a call from your best friend Mickey, he's crying too. He's telling you about how you were right and he'll be able to pay off his student loan soon. Also his wife is pregnant. You congratulate him with a fickle grin and fake laugh. You look back down at your phone, 828.16. 830.00, 838.26. 

WallStreetBets has crashed due to the traffic. 


You realise everything you stood for is coming true, but you paper handed too soon. 

You ignored the threads, the experts. You ignored DeepFuckingValue. 

You ignored your god given right to a better life for you and your wifes boyfriend. 


You try to buy back in, but you have no money. You begin to laugh, and laugh. Despair and anguish turn into humour. 


You pull the Glock from your $16 AliExpress safe and load it. You hold it to your head, you shiver. 


You don't pull the trigger. Your paper hands can't do it, and never will be able to do anything of any meaningful value. You drop the gun and admit defeat. 


As the camera pans out of your window and over your neighborhood, we see Wall St burning in flames in the distance. The transfer of wealth begins, fade to black.

Wsb isn't selling. Maybe even buying the dip.  The shorters eventually need to cover and will be buying.  

So where is all this sell pressure coming from? Could it be from institutional rebalancing?

Looking at whale wisdom and sort by % of portfolio.  That percentage shot up for all these funds by 1/31, and they all hold tens of thousands of shares.

Guy claims that GME is bouncing back due to Robinhood lifting the GME restriction. Stock started bouncing back at 10:50 am.

Anyone STILL using RH can confirm that Robinhood lifted the restriction around that period? If so, that definitely confirmed the hypothesis GME is down due to low RH demand(amongst other reasons such as short ladder attack). If you have cash in RH, you need to move all your money into another brokerage now!! There is no guarantee that RH wouldn't pull some BS tactics again in the near future.

"All ""WSB stocks"" are being treated the same by the media. They're not the same.",277,lb0gcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0gcj/all_wsb_stocks_are_being_treated_the_same_by_the/,36,1612313914.0,"The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV.",2021-02-03 02:58:34

Long-time lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity!

I've  truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first I came for  the memes (guilty) but stayed for the community. As with most of the  world and especially the US life has been pretty challenging  over the  last year.  For me, that's meant an anxiety and depression cocktail  which not even my wife's boyfriend could help me get out of. I stopped  caring for myself and caring about anything really and although I keep  trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this.

That  changed two weeks ago when my friend and I decided to go in on GME and  just see what happens. I went from checking this sub a few times a week  to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement,  banding together, and support I have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks  have been amazing! It jolted me back into caring at least a little bit  about myself and life. It didn't solve the challenges I face but I feel  more alive than I have in over a year and it has helped me see I can get  out of the dark place I was in with some help and putting in a little  effort each day to change my behaviors.

I  appreciate all of you (Not you paper hands though) and please drink  water, exercise, try and eat healthy, and take time to disconnect once  and a while. Care for the people in your life and any strangers who are  not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders.

GME valuation,138,lb0btt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0btt/gme_valuation/,39,1612313614.0,"This is not financial advice (maybe we need to change some laws if we have to always write these disclosures)

I’m a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.

What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.

At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasn’t because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didn’t matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasn’t worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price.
Also, and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities, and unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt you don’t borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and “giving” you that money so you can get out debt.

I bought some GME this morning because it felt like a good gamble and my guess is that there are still some shorts value in the short entities",2021-02-03 02:53:34

Today is February 2nd, the hedgies thought Groundhog’s Day could be used as a cucking mechanism against us retarded apes. They should’ve known better than to fuck with us. As an owner of GME, BB, NOK, AMC and Blockbuster, I know how shitty today has felt for a lot of people.

BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU LISTEN. To all the new investors that have just joined this sub over the last week and a half: Buy, the fucking, dip. It’s really that simple. So when I was eating crayons and having not fucking a groundhog five years ago, my novice dumbass investing brain thought you sold to save anything you had left - that was WRONG. Instead, when you buy more shares at a lower price, you LOWER YOUR COST BASIS.

What does this mean?

It means if you bought 10 shares of GME at $300 and then bought another 10 at $80, your cost basis is $190. Essentially, you’re not only lessening losses but you now have the potential to make even sweeter tendies. Now, when the price goes back up to $300 (which it will, because we are lubing that groundhog anus), you will now have a gain of $2,200. Yes, you’re buying more shares, but you’re now getting better value. That’s what fucking matters.

*TLDR: Buy. It actually makes things cheaper in the long-run during rebounds and can make you richer. Panic selling will only hurt you more.*",2021-02-03 02:49:43

Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship",2021-02-03 02:39:33

GME and a rigged horse race,105,lazuc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lazuc6/gme_and_a_rigged_horse_race/,24,1612312447.0,"Your friend just got the hot tip on a race horse who is a sure thing and you think fuck it... why not.

The bookie you use takes your bet and prices the horse 25/1... the horse wins the race by 75 lengths and you’re convinced it’s worth betting again.

The next race, the horse comes back and for some reason the bookie didn’t even bother to price the odds correctly and prices the horses odds at 20/1.
You take your winnings from last week and pile it all on your favourite horse to win again.

This cycle continues for a few weeks until you’ve taken your initial sum of money and cleared out the bookie for hundreds of thousands, millions perhaps.

This weeks race comes up and the bookie realised how much money you’ve made from this one horse and decides he doesn’t want to live with that kind of a loss to his balance sheet.

You place your bet with all of your winnings for this weeks race and again, the horses odds stay the same.

The bookie then makes a trip to the racecourse where your horse is, pauses the race and starts to smack your horse with a baseball bat to its legs for a while and then finally lets the race proceed. 

You lose your bet, all your winnings and the bookie is back to where he started because he couldn’t face having to lose all his money.

If this was a true story, the bookie and whoever helped him set this whole incident up would be sent to jail for defrauding the gambling industry and fixing the outcome of a race.

Link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/short-squeeze-stockbrokers-and-hedge-funds-face-proposed-antitrust-class-action-301220375.html

In case you zoomers, boomers, and everyone in between have never heard of them, J.S. is literally one of the world’s best and most successful firms for antitrust litigation.

Read the article if you’re still mad at all these brokers for limiting our ability to buy, because frankly, if anyone can win this lawsuit, it would be the Joseph Saveri Law Firm.

Now, I got this news from a lawyer myself, so I’m not exactly sure about this, but at the end of the article it states “Plaintiffs seek to recover damages, as well as injunctive relief, on behalf of themselves and the proposed class, from the defendants.” Based on lines near the beginning, I assume this “class” is any retail investor invested in any of the 12 companies’ (YES, 12) stocks mentioned??
If so, wouldn’t this mean we would all be entitled to compensation?

I hope so.
Until then, hold, and buy the dip.

Of course, they will use every trick of the book.

Am I biased? Yes, do I seek confirmation bias? You bet. Am I an autist? Helloo!

I just doubled my position and throwed in 30k more. If this thing went to the moon and back once, I believe it will go to another galaxy far far away.

These guys are really bad (and not the wife bf kind of bad). They control the market. They are the market makers. They know whats going on. They have all kind of data and info to enable them to reduce maximum loss.

it is true they were caught off guard in the beginning, but they fucking had time to regroup and utilize their mate and force against you stupid fellow autist and retard. You bet they have all kind of algos to buy all the paper hands while they ladder attack the shit out of this stock. They have money and power. To expect less means you are beyond redemption kind of retardation.

The thing you should understand is that they are in the bargaining stage. They want to shack of the most amount of leaves of the tree before they accept their inevitable faith.

You have to consider that we went to the moon and back without a single comment from RC or the company. I find that strange, but I would not be very surprised if the SEC fucking threatened them, knowing how rigged is the system. But you bet they have something big cooking. You bet they have multiple billion ideas to turn around the company. You bet they have a thousand trillion offers made to them by the aliens and gods of the universe to capitalise on this movement that was never seen before and never will be seen.

So, what to do? Well, you fucking buy and thank your wife's bf for keeping your wife away from distracting you to seize on this opportunity to buy. Because soon enough, you would fucking regret not buying, similar to how you fucking felt when the price was 500+ and you are sitting on a sorry ass amount of shares. Double down, because we got them by the balls and your future sell will regret it either way if you dont capitalize on this opportunity.

>  
>When  you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on  their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts  and wont blink an eye.

>If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

>(...)I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the  more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only  question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going  to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a  group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont  cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.

IF WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM BUYING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STOCK THEN WHOS PLACING ORDERS TO BUY BIG QUANTITIES FOR CHEAPPPP ON LEVEL II???? STRAIGHT UP MANIPULATION❗️❗️❗️❗️ 

1)BIG dip to cause FEAR. A small RECOVERY for people to PANIC SELL believing to cut LOSSES at recovery 

2)Compare VOLUME from last week to this week and yet BIG PRICE MOVEMENT. PROOF of MANIPULATION 

3) Restricting purchase = RESTRICTING DEMAND = MANIPULATING A PRICE DROP. How is it that if you COMPARE GME, AMC, BB charts since last week, they all move up and down about the same time in a synchronized order❗️❗️❗️


4) NOT SELLING = NOT LOSING. (yes, you may have loses and are RED but they’re UNREALIZED LOSSES). You DONT lose until you SELL. 

5)Media talking that the squeeze is over and that retail lost interest and demand for these stocks. NO WE DID NOT LOSE INTEREST we are being ILLEGALLY RESTRICTED FROM PURCHASING 

6)check posts how around the world they’re being RESTRICTED from buying 

7)I believe in the VW model of infinity squeeze. I think that’s what Wall Street is afraid of

8)REINFORCEMENTS - A lot of ppl had to open new broker accounts such as FIDELITY and have to wait to get funded. I believe once THIS BS RESTRICTION around the world is OVER we will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕.

9) All we can do is HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 our loses are limited by our investment but our GAINS ARE UNLIMITED

"Bullish signs on a seemingly tragic day, we're still in the game: price action DD",146,lazley,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lazley/bullish_signs_on_a_seemingly_tragic_day_were/,25,1612311871.0,"EDIT: forgot to add GME in the title. This is for the GME boyz

Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.

However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($76.76). GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $76.76 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.

**So, why is today's price action bullish?**

Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it **BOUNCES OFF OF THEM**, thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run. **PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.** They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.

Now look at GME recovery.

And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $76.76 resistance now turned into support.

Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.

**To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.**

What is Market Tuition? How to Handle Loss,57,lazjwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lazjwo/what_is_market_tuition_how_to_handle_loss/,11,1612311775.0,"I know exactly what you did... You saw some deep red in your portfolio today and got scared as it kept going down in the morning volatility. You probably felt fucked... Then when it kept going, you just had enough and **sold**. Through the constant preaching of ""holding the line,"" you left your position and ""realized"" your loss with hands made of papyrus.

In all seriousness, this isn't to shit on you or say that you failed your part. Chances are, if you're reading this then you're in need of some help (or you know someone who does need help). The reasons you may have had to pull the sell-trigger are none of our business.

What you just experienced is what I like to call **""Market Tuition.""**

Now that you've solidified or ""realized"" whatever loss potential you may have had, here is some advice to help you accept the loss and move on.

# 1. Try not to get caught up in thinking about the past.

What's done is done. You've made your position and settled your exit. The less you think about it, the faster you can recover both mentally and financially. Consider a break. Do the shit that makes you happy and distracts you far away from the market.

# 2. Consider what's left, look at what's ahead

Look at what you have left. And if nothing else, assuming you have a source of income, it may bring you some solace knowing that you can file [capital loss tax deductions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp) (3k annually until net breakeven). In some ways, you can say that the government is taking on the weight of your loss.

# 3. ""It's just numbers""

It may be difficult to look at your portfolio and see it as ""just numbers"". After all, these ""numbers"" could have taken you months or years to accrue. But the more you simplify the event, the better you can accept what has happened.

There was a larger number in your portfolio, now there is a smaller number. That's all it is.

# 4. Close the position? Close the chart.

Stop looking at the stock chart. Plain and simple. Prevent yourself from regretting your decisions. If you are no longer in the position and are not considering a new one any time soon, then it's probably best to distance yourself away from any reminders of your loss.

# 5. You lost money. But gained experience.

This is a cost of learning how to feel the market. Not everyone is born with diamond hands. Many people, just like you, second-guess their positions. Even the most experienced investor can doubt his/her securities. But if nothing else, the market teaches discipline. What could you do differently next time? Did you have a game plan? If the answer to that was no, I'm sure you'll be less likely to go without one next time.

Once you've considered all of these steps, then you're already well on your way to recovery. I'm not gonna tell you how to use your money. But consider this advice from someone else who has [seen loss](https://ibb.co/n7m8nzx).

I've spent the past year recouping loss. And finally, after all this time obsessing over charts and news, I broke even last week. It was a combination of a small steady income and investing my small positions into stable growers until I had enough to do larger option plays. And by that time, I was much more prepared.

Money will come and go. Are you going to waste your time thinking about it?

Or will you start your journey to recover losses and break-even as an even better investor.

You can make it back. Godspeed.",2021-02-03 02:22:55

"Start Playing Towards Your Strengths, and Stop Acting Invincible. Much like GameStop, WSB Must Return to Their Core Competencies to Succeed.",158,lazj51,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lazj51/start_playing_towards_your_strengths_and_stop/,23,1612311726.0,"Listen up retards, and most importantly new members, it is important that you actually read this post and others. I know it’s a joke around here, too many words can’t read, I get it. Information is a valuable weapon, stop voluntarily ignoring it.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock, and that is why I am going to provide some insight into how GME arrived to the position they are in, and how WSB arrived to the position we are in now.

**GameStop Backstory**

I will briefly cover the backstory of GameStop, but for more accurate information and in depth discussion I recommend you listen to Rod Alzmann’s GME DD as a guest on the Modern Guilt podcast found on Spotify. 

Essentially, GameStop began to slip as E-commerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now. As a result, earlier management tried to pivot away from GameStop’s core competencies (large user base and trade-in/second hand sales) which pushed it further into misfortune. Eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely.

**WSB Backstory**

Leading up to the now viral GME bonanza, this sub and the strategies used were much different. GME started off as a value play, although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play. The following was small at first, but grew as GMEs potential grew. The core competencies of the following consisted of excellent DD, knowledgeable users willing to share research, and less knowledgeable users willing to learn.

I no longer feel as though this is the core competency of GME gang, the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction. That is not a bad thing and I will get to that later.

Once the GME squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by GME gang, the original competencies actually flourished. Users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze. The prevailing strategy was to buy shares only, never use margin or over leverage yourself, and not to purchase options. 

Those competencies were what made WSB unstoppable in the begging, and they were based on pure reason alone. Buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on HFs, avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls, and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room.

These strategies worked, and you can check the first week and a half of the GME movement to confirm that it was rock solid. But then something happened, people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares. Because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly, it resulted in all calls ending ITM on the Friday before last week, it produced a gamma squeeze.

But that tactic is short lived, the MMs quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium. **The options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term, momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin.**

I understand the allure of options, but just consider the amount of money that vanished last Friday. Calculate the cost of all of those options from $330-$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted. Yes, it was stolen form you, it wouldn’t have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking GME buys, but it is time to adapt and overcome.

**Return to your core competencies, and improve upon them. Stop ignoring thorough DD and stop neglecting to do your own, do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny. Return to the original thesis**

**Improve the Core Competencies**

We are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous, but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid. **If you read anything in this post it should be this.** The stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear. The squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds. Hedge funds have an abundance of money, but they lack the volume to close their positions. Individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against HFs. 

Think about this, HFs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding. When the price is low, retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares. The price being low puts HFs in a **bad position**. At low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares, further increasing the scarcity. For those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250, $300, $400 etc, I salute you but I don’t encourage this behavior. 

Buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns. **Let them trigger the short sell rule, let them give you a discount**

A squeeze can start at $1 or $1000, it doesn’t matter, and the base cost of the stock equally doesn’t matter in an infinity squeeze.

Return to your core competencies, allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price. Buy when the price is cheap, allow it to inflate naturally, and wait for it fall again before loading up more. Once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds, there are three ways to win. A positive catalyst, natural price growth, or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death.

Options are no longer effective, consolidate your efforts.

Do your part to spread and scrutinize important information. 

Stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you. If you’re still on Robinhood, set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately. If you’re still on margin take it off. If youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them. Get extended hours trading. Get off toxic brokerage platforms.

Return to your core competencies and stop running in circles.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing in this post should be used as investment advice. This is my take on a purely speculative situation, and I recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade. I like the stock and own GME shares.🚀🚀

**TL:DR: for starters, stop slacking off and actually read DD posts, information is essential in warfare. Stop buying options, they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by MMs and now works against us. Return to the strategy that got us to this point.**

**The price dropping allows retail investors to maximize the effectiveness of the only weapon they truly have against HFs**

Before reddit was just a social media platform; a joke platform where people could come to for a laugh. Now look at us. Making the big moneies cry, news outlets despiratly spreading rummors to test our strenght and try to rip us appart. They try to make us collapse, try to make us crash with fallen out teeth and broken bones. BUT WE DO NOT BREAK. WE DO NOT FALL. We are one, and together, we shall rise higher than a man could dream. Higher than the stars can reach. The stars, the stars shall reach for us.

These restrictions came into play when the stock price was over $200-300 for GME and $15-17 for AMC. Both of these stocks are now half their fucking value. 

If their reasoning to restrict buying is that they needed to have the funds to cover their clients purchases as well as the stock being exuberantly high then WHY THE FUCK THERE STILL A RESTRICTION???

Then fucking clear out, we don’t host fucking pity parties on this sub. 

The camaraderie and bonding that I’ve seen on this sub in the last few weeks, even with all the newcomers, has honestly been something I haven’t seen here in this magnitude before. We’re here together, we’re fighting this together, we might as well stay in this together. 

And if there’s anything I needed to see to restore the little bit of hope that was starting to falter, it was Mark Cuban’s AMA. We CAN do this. We have BEEN doing it. *They’re fucking scared.* We’re fucking scared. Folks at home on their couches are fucking scared. Stop pretending like your worries & fears are singular or unique to you. It’s fight or flight time, so either hold the fucking line with your brothers and sisters, or shut the fuck up and post your loss porn once you sell.

Come for the gainz and stay for the collective laughs of the loss porn. 

Something to keep in mind though, it's hardly 100% of our portfolio for most of us and we want to be in the game a lot longer than one play. It's for the principle for this one and I went into it with full intentions on losing every dollar I put in and I hope to fucking God you did too but probably not because you're a fucking retard just like many. 

But there's a light at the end of the tunnel. (kinda) there's always another play, there's always tomorrow to squeeze another HF nuts.

There is so much good going for this company right now and $BB discussion has been relatively quiet. This dip is an absolute discount fire sale right now and although I am not a financial adviser and do not offer this as advice I am definitely thrilled about the buying opportunity and will definitely be capitalizing on it. Although I have been a member here for a short period and only trading for a few years now, I like to think I know a solid value play, especially in tech thanks to you smooth brains, when I see one. 1 - 3 years and this stock will make the difference between retiring comfortably on time and retiring early with excess spending money.

&#x200B;

I like the stock, BUY THE DIP!",2021-02-03 02:11:38

1: The most important point is you cannot beat the big guys, it doesn’t matter one bit, you will not win. They have the politicians, brokers, and market makers in their pockets, you can’t win at a broken game. The only way to make money is to ride their wave because as we all know, they always win, or to play something that they do
not know of and have no desire to dabble in.

2: WSB has grown exponentially in the past week or so, and for everyone who is new, this does not happen often. There is usually a meme stock such as TSLA or PLTR, but these do not boom like GME, this was a one off occasion.

3: The second the plays off WSB become mainstream, we lose. Everyone and their brother wanted to get in on these “free” tendies, but with that came a lot of paper handed bitches who sold when it went down 10%, which caused exponential destruction of the stock price.

4: Finally for everyone, this is an opportunity for us to learn, and to use WSB as a tool to gain wealth. We can look as other peoples DD and do our own DD on those picks and see what we like, and WSB is overall a meme sub where people post gain and loss porn and we all are amazed at what can happen.",2021-02-03 02:11:17

However, simply holding doesnt stop their ladder attacks. They are trading securities they already are holding themselves. If we take what is left in the market or worse, whats put in by paper hands, we reduce the pool of available shares and their ladder attacks only go so far.

What happens if everyone holds and no buying occurs? **They can drive the price down as much as they damn well feel like, causing more and more people to sell in the hysteria.** 

There are so few shares out there that could even remotely begin to cover their damn positions with (remember, they shorted over 100% of shares before this whole run up) meaning they HAVE to cover their asses eventually and the ladder attacks cannot go on as long as we BUY to REDUCE their efficacy and HOLD to force the demand upwards and reverse this momentum they are creating. 

**WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED A SHORT SQUEEZE**

We need to make that happen ourselves. Right now, we are at the precipice of the squeeze. Either it happens, by us buying whats left (NOT ON RH, OR OTHER RESTRICTED PLATFORMS) or we hold like the real retards while these rich fucks laugh their asses off and double down their short positions to do what they have inevitably been doing this whole damn time, which is making money on the way down.

Simpleton Version,71,laz8m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laz8m9/simpleton_version/,13,1612311057.0,"So let's put it in simple words so everyone has a clear picture of what's happening. 

The float is the number of tradable shares of a company's stock. 

1) Melvin and his chums shorted 140% of the float. Since stock is issued by the company, and short sellers have to borrow stock to conduct their business, this means they shorted 40% more than the number of shares that were ever issued. So, being greedy, they borrowed fake shares to short to really kick the company in the balls. 

2) Even after shorting 140%, Melvin still lost $6 billion give or take. Also, Melvin is owned by Citadel, who doesn't like that their baby lost. 

3) So.. Citadel turns to his other, uglier child called Robinloot (Citadel gives Robinloot 40% of their allowance), and tells him to stop letting everyone buy more shares, only sell. 

4) Citadel get's all major media outlets to report that Reddit buyers are flocking to Silver to try and divert away from GME and AMC. Luckily, we have the internet and phones and this isn't the 90's with dial up. So for some of those pricks who went to school for journalism and paid $60k to study how to write a fucking article, could just open this page and see that WSB was in fact saying they didn't buy Silver. 

5) Citadel also owns almost 0.98% of SLV ETF, is one of the largest buyers of calls and also owns large amounts of shares in more than 10 other instruments tracking silver. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Citadel is conveniently related to every single part of what's going on. 

I didn't move from a third world country to deal with this kind of bullshit and open corruption and market manipulation. What the fuck. 

&#x200B;

AOC, Biden, Elon, Chamath, Mark Cuban, Kevin O'Leary or anybody who can help, please help. This is ridiculous now.

In the past couple of weeks our sub count has almost doubled. What does this mean? It means that purely by the numbers, our favourite fucking subreddit is no longer only comprised of autists. We can fix this in one of two ways: we boot all the new joiners, or welcome them in our little autistic dinosaur arms and force autism into their ass like a gay Harvey Weinstein.

Right now, this autist is leaning toward the former. All this horseshit about ""sticking it to the suits"" is driving my cue ball brain up the fucking wall. What the fuck do you mean? Squeeze out the 2 funds that are short so you can shit money for the other 30 fucking funds that are long? Don't give me some bullshit that there's actual justice being done here. It's only about the fucking money. You retarded fucking bagholders are only telling people to buy because you can't accept your portfolio looking like Donald Trump's colon.

There's also the unlimited supply of dogshit here every day now about how GME and AMC are fundamentally worth their spiked prices. Isn't this against rule 7 of the sub? GME was visibly failing and AMC was billions in debt even before the pandemic. Buy whatever the fuck you want, but WSB doesn't endorse making shit up about fundamentals you don't understand. Saying ""this isn't financial advice"" in your post means nothing. Confirmation bias at this level opens the SEC to investigate us for market manipulation.

And finally, to the new guys in our midst: if you came to this sub hoping to make money, you were fucking retarded and get the fuck out. Go to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) or some shit. Here, making money has only ever been second to memes. What this sub has always been about is YOLO plays on worthless meme stocks, followed by loss porn and some of the best fucking memes Reddit has ever seen (obligatory shoutout to [u/haupt91](https://www.reddit.com/u/haupt91/) and the OG WSB retard gang).

answered by u/mcuban : 

 ""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.

Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.

That then accelerates the selling.

Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular

So what to do ?

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

SNM Analysis & Predictions,5,laywn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laywn3/snm_analysis_predictions/,5,1612310300.0,"I felt it was time for me to gather some thoughts about ShaMaran. Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

www.forbes.com/sites/debtwire/2021/01/04/iraqi-and-kurdistan-budget-hangs-in-the-balance/amp/  


Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility""

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.

What to do and not do if you want to partake in GME mania,78,layw9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layw9m/what_to_do_and_not_do_if_you_want_to_partake_in/,7,1612310273.0,"This is not a post about whether GME is going to 0 or Pluto. This post is strictly about what one should or shouldn’t do if one wants to buy/sell GME. 

&#x200B;

1. Figure out how much you are willing to trade. Treat the money you are willing to trade as lost money. This way you know your max loss and if you are willing to accept that loss, then you can diamond hand any red day.

&#x200B;

2. Don’t trade on margin. One of my best friends bought AMD at $2 and still lost it all because he went on margin and was forced to liquidate. Brokerages can and will manually liquidate your positions to cover their asses. Bottom line, don’t do it. 

&#x200B;

3. Have an exit strategy. Let’s be honest here, the distance to the moon, Pluto, and Andromeda are finite, same goes for GME. You don’t have to admit it to anyone on WSB, but you should always have a number that when reached, you are willing to exit.

&#x200B;

4. Don’t get greedy. The saying that pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered is very true. Ask any 🐻 who held on past 4/1/2020 to show you their account and you will see. Again, you don’t have to admit it here, but know it in your heart.

&#x200B;

5. Be fluid. Market condition changes, that goes both ways. Assuming you are following the above rules, there may be days where you will buy the dip. To the contrary, there may be days when you profit take. 

&#x200B;

6. Don’t be a sheep. Let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment. Not all hedge funds are betting against GME. There are hedge funds betting on GME. Moreover, there are people who are trying to profit from directional movement in either direction and are spreading lies on WSB to enrich themselves. Don’t be a sheep and blindly follow others.

&#x200B;

7. Be on the look out for the next 10 bagger. I assume that almost no one here wants GME to be their last trade. I’m not saying you should sell your positions, what I’m saying is always be on the lookout for the next big thing while you hold on to your position. It would be the same thing as you getting into GME when it was $5.

&#x200B;

8. Don’t let GME break you. Trading takes a toll no matter if you are up or down. Don’t let one trade crush you. Remember, you are trading to get rich so you can better yourself, not trading to become a slave.

&#x200B;

\*I have never purchased or sold short,  nor do I intend to purchase or sell short any GME equities or derivatives. Having said that, I wish my WSB brothers best of luck.",2021-02-03 01:57:53

Stay strong my $GME brethren. If this drops down to $35.50ish like i expect it to I will be adding to this position. I love the company and products, Historic earnings coming soon. Wish i would have entered after the predictable ipo drop but this wasn't on my radar lol Oh well. Wish you all the best.

A poem for the paperhanded,65,layu0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layu0p/a_poem_for_the_paperhanded/,8,1612310115.0,"A friend of mine wrote a poem that explains the strategy of a marvelous trader we both look up to. It's sweet, it's short, but not short like those hedge funds we're about to squeeze. Here goes!

Take it easy,
Take it slow.
Sell when it's high,
After buying when it's low.

Emotion is dangerous,
Leave it out of the game.
Become a true robot,
And you'll always trade the same.

Hold with both hands,
Hold it till you're right.
And if it doesn't listen,
Cut your loss without spite.

Find value in the symbol,
And play what's in play.
The secret to profits,
Is to do this every day.

Common sense is gifted,
Use it to its fullest.
Don't overthink stuff,
Are you bearish or bullish.

Manage risk at all costs,
Small losses and big wins.
The house controls the market,
But you pull your own strings.

So get on going now,
And focus as a pro.
Discipline and patience,
Will make your portfolio grow.

Use it to your advantage, one day you might be sailing the sea of tendies on the SS Diamond Hands.",2021-02-03 01:55:15

My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:

&#x200B;

[a lot of ask's with a \(relatively\) big volume at once ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrkvhr133f61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f0ed5ea7661f596f47ec077aaa851114c46611)

The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.

&#x200B;

[Here you can clearly see that the volume of stocks being dumped on the market is going down.](https://preview.redd.it/16dezk0l33f61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=a070b8551318b19742b7514028b569e50eeb5a4d)

So what does that mean for us? As long as we're not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down, but that doesn't matter as long as we keep holding with our FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS 💎🤲!!

99% of you retards don't know what the fuck is going on. Buy this, no buy that,  no it dipped, sell, oh no it went up, I'm a retard. This is what I'm constantly seeing from all the new faces

A certain 5G stock #knockknock has been getting hype for a few weeks now and it has REASONABLY been ignored because we support our brothers fighting the good GME fight.

NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

everyone keeps complaining about how high of a float this stock is. 

I GUARANTEE you that is not an issue. The publicity that this got this week was unprecedented. We bought so much that these fucks are restricting us from buying a leading 5g stock that has been around since 1865. My broker told me I had to cancel my sell order because it was stuck in citadels order book. What the FUCK does that mean? We are being suppressed for a reason. HEDGE FUNDS LIKE THE STOCK

And guess what motherfuckers!? I LIKE THE GOD DAMN STOCK TOO!

Price target $50+:

1. Most essential 5G patents in the world
2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded
3. Controls over 27% of the 4/5G market
4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA)
5. Will receive MULTI-BILLION dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo
6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project)
7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project
8. Has pending Department of Defense contracts yet to awarded
9. Just sealed a contract with TMOBILE for US 5G roll out.
10. Has and will take market share from Huawei, already has secured multi-year deals with important Chinese companies
11. Blackrock increased their position to 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase)
12. May also be getting back into the phone business as they are manufacturing phones in India
13. Vanguard Capital owns 160,000,000 shares and is continuously buying
14. Google Cloud announced a partnership with $NOK to Accelerate Cloud-Native 5G Readiness for Communications Providers

Go look at the good DDs that were initially posted and keep in mind they have a 50%+ market share in their industry (UEM for corporations and Govs, OS for vehicules and communication encryption for multiple clients). BB is everywhere around you and you don't necessarily realize it.

Could it go back down to $8 with all the bullshit going down? Sure it could. Can it go back up to $30 by EOY? Conservatively, yes. They are working hard to change perceptions and even without the initial hype, $20-30 usd is a very conservative valuation for BB when you look at comparables and at their financials.

Not everything is a squeeze and remember that GME started as a value play more than a year ago...

People need to understand the GME saga is not united in its ideology. You need to adapt your expectations to that key fundamental fact. There are many factions of ""investors"" here. This was the case from the beginning, and has amplified as time went on and public exposure to the stock grew. People have their own agendas and plans, their own unique circumstances. This innate disunity is what is being used against you.  The billion dollar hedge funds know your lack of cohesion can be exploited, and that is exactly what they are doing. It is actually their only option. What else can they do? Admit defeat, close their doors forever and swallow untold tens of billions more in losses to cover their still numerous outstanding shorts? No, they are going to keep kicking the can down the road as long as they can, hoping to break your chokehold on them by exploiting your factions. They do this with lying, cheating, market manipulation and much more. But their main play to break the squeeze is the same: they need you to scatter and sell. Why did the VW squeeze of 2008 work so well? Because one single company (Porsche) bought up all the stock and one person was making all the decisions about holding and selling. In that case, the hedge funds were the ones caught off-guard,  scrambling in disarray to compete with each other and grab up all the shares they could. Right now, those same hedge funds are acting in collaboration and we, the retail investors are the ones in disarray. 

There are people who bought GME to make money. Everybody loves money right? That's probably why most people bought it. But there are also a lot of people who bought GME as a form of protest and revenge against the criminal class of Wall Street. There are people who love the company Gamestop and envision a brilliant future for it. Some people took personal offense to shorts coming in and trying to break down a store they like. Some people just really like the stock. Maybe people bought it for all of the above and much more.  No matter the reason, if you want to win, you will need to find common ground and learn to work together if you want to see the line go up and force those cornered hedge fund shorts to pay up. You have been given a golden opportunity to squeeze billions out of these Wall Street funds. It is very unlikely an event like this will happen again, at least not for a very long time. 

What I saw this morning was a predictable product of our innate disunity. Due to the viral exposure of WSB and the GME frenzy many new investors moved in last week in a very short amount of time. This created a ""hype"" bubble, which is actually fairly common in the stock market and happens all the time. This brought in all sorts of novice and first time stock owners, especially ones who don't understand basic stock market mechanics like price, volume, and order books. (Please people, learn that price does not mean much without VOLUME) They came in hoping to make a quick buck. They bought in at a higher price last week, saw the price per share tumble Friday, fell for all the fake news, rumors and distractions over the weekend because they don't understand that hedge funds lie for a business, saw the share price tumble today without understanding why, then panicked. They sold, dropping the price further, which panicked other investors of the same mindset, they sold, and so on until stop losses were triggered and caused more sales which panicked further people who sold and so on. This has been a strategy of the hedge funds since day one of taking money from the dumb retail market. It is just particularly effective when there is a bubble in stock price. This is actually an argument many people use as a justification of shorts, as they keep the entire market rational and prevent a bubble from ever forming so big that it has catastrophic economic consequences. But that is neither here nor there. But the point is people are confusing two separate events, this rapid bubble that formed last week and popped some steam off today, and the squeeze which has been a steady and gradual process. Remember, GME was $4 just 6 months ago. What was the low price today, with the stock price manipulation and panic selling here? Somewhere around $80?  Which is right about where the price was last week Monday just before it went absolutely viral. 

GME is still heavily overshorted. The Bloomberg terminal screenshot posted in another post here shows 90% as of today, 2/2/21. We are still in a squeeze. Yes, we had a temporary bubble and setback from our climb up, but no, this is not over by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to see the share price keep climbing then HOLD. If you want to see Wall Street bleed, choke on their arrogance and hubris, then HOLD. If you want to make Gamestop the funniest meme in all of stock market history, HOLD!!!! Feeding the hedge funds back shares at a lower price takes the pressure off them and lets them cover while mitigating their losses. Don't feed the hedge funds. We have the upperhand. We have the power and leverage. Only we can give it up and squander it away. They are the ones bleeding millions in interest. They are the ones with furious shareholders and wealth investors breathing down their necks. It costs us nothing but the own stress we give ourselves to hold. I agree we are up against a rigged system. We should all be calling and emailing our congress representatives to demand investigations into why so many brokers shut out new buyers but not sellers starting Thursday. We should be demanding investigations into institutional shorters who are manipulating the stock price purposefully by pingponging shares back and forth to each other with lower and lower prices supplemented with coordinated large dumps. We should be demanding investigations into what the financial relationships are, if any, between certain brokers who froze out buyers and these institutions with massive shorts on GME that we are betting against. We should be demanding adherence to SEC rules regarding transparent short positions. There is a lot to fix and change. So let's try to stay united on the things we can all agree on, like making the market fair for the little guy. Let's stay united in our vigilance against deceit and misinformation spread by these shorters. Let's stay united in our conviction to HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No amount of short ladder attacks, price manipulation, rumors, or fake news can scare us holders into selling. Why? Because we are ideologically united. The money will follow, if you hold.

This is more therapeutic for my own disappointment than it is me trying to ""teach"" you guys the most important lesson.

##I fucked up today 

and it cost me $7k that I will most likely be realizing all or most tomorrow.  I set a long term PT on GME of $40-60 because I want to see a $10bn GameStop in the next year or so and instead I got excited and emotional and jumped in around the $129 mark this afternoon thinking ""tHe SqOzEnInG"".

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/TtTEksS.jpg) my screw-up because I got emotional and didn't wait patiently to see if the ""upward"" trend this afternoon had firm footing. Spoiler alert: it did not. I was only up by about $2k when the floor fell out from under me.

I am EXTREMELY LUCKY because I've been trading all the way up and managed to sell quite a lot of $19dca shares at $380 and throw those profits into my savings account, but I left $25k (about 25% of my gains) in my investment account to ""play around"" with.

My CPA said not to, and I thought I could outsmart him. Ideally tomorrow won't be straight red, and I can escape with $17k or more (hopefully) but this should teach you that:

##SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A SHIT TRADE. 

That's why you're supposed to play with money that you can UNEMOTIONALLY LOSE. Seriously guys, it's giving me secondhand panic to see the guys who threw their savings in at $300 and watching the value sink very steadily down to $80 (and possibly less) and then they justify it with ""buuuuut it's to show the 1% how powerful I am!"" They're still billionaires and you're getting evicted. You really showed them.

##Going forward? I'll write this $7k against my gains and maybe toss the remaining $17k into the SPY or something boomerish while I wait to file my taxes next year OR I'll drop the position to 100 shares realizing about $3,000 in losses and sell weekly covered calls to *hopefully* chase the decreasing share price until I feel comfortable holding very long term or get assigned above my DCA.

Thinking back from the past month there is one thing that has stood out and resonated with me more than anything else.

This is simply that the vast majority of people are generous when they come across a sudden inflow of cash. As soon as people here started making money, you guys started immediately paying it forward, which is absolutely incredible to see. **For this you should be incredibly proud of yourselves.** 

It is encouraging to see that people can maintain the capability to care about others when they come across money, this is the way it should be. 


My least favorite part is how the media tried to paint this place in a way that tricks the general population into thinking we’re the enemies, yet during all of this there has been nothing but helping each other out and ensuring that the wealth was spread in ways to those that weren’t able to participate or finding ways to help someone else. The media then praises Wall Street for cheating, stealing, and continuing their parasitic tendencies. It just goes to show you who is in control of the narrative; **Scared sociopathic wealthy people who know the majority are far better people than they’ll ever be so they try and compensate with their socio-economic status, when in reality, it just shows how sad and insecure you have always been.** 

Wall Street individuals should take a step back and realize that lining their pockets isn’t all that life is about and at a certain point of net worth, accumulating wealth doesn’t even bring happiness anymore and does not get you anything extra at the end of life. A more enriching way to go through life is by finding ways to bring joy and easing pain for others. Be selfless instead of selfish and I can guarantee when your time comes, you’ll look back and feel that your life truly had a purpose and your family will be honored to carry on your legacy.

Right now, you folks on Wall Street betting against and fighting back at this movement are no better than a street drug addict who steals. Desperate, scared, and has no other option than to fuck someone else over. That’s not the best legacy to leave behind. In fact, it’s down right disgraceful. The majority of you Wall Street folks should consider going through some therapy because your way of thinking is not normal. You got lucky, you are not special, and if you lack empathy you probably have some unaddressed trauma from your past.

**TLDR**: Selflessness will always make you feel better than selfishness. 

If you are against this movement you are proving to the world that you do in fact have severe mental issues and they are taking away your ability to create true happiness for yourself, you should talk with someone to help you through this. It is not too late to change your way of thinking towards other people.

If you read all of this, thank you. Obviously it doesn’t change anything, but I really thought you should all know that the generosity is appreciated and gives hope that people aren’t all bad.

All I want to do is bring awareness to the volume. Look at the shiny graph above. Take a second to look at the volume by price range (the red and green sideways bar), the volume (in blue), and then the volume rate of change (green graph at the bottom). When the stonk was beginning to take off, volume was high with modest rates of change in volume. What does this mean?  Well, what you'd expect: people hearing of the stonk and buying more. As it peaked, volume dropped. Interestingly, volume rate of change was low (and even negative at one point). Both of these were low until today, and yet the stonk kept falling - what does this tell you? Hint: check some of the top posts in this sub. Coupled with the volume by price, there seems to be a net buying interest. I want to now point out the hump in the volume rate of change corresponding to today. Notice how the first hump happened early in the day as the stonk continued to plummet. Based on some WSB sentiment, this is likely scare tactics working and cuckies fearing the worst and selling off to lock in gains (or limit losses). But more importantly, notice the big peak in rate of change as the stonk dropped. People are seeing this offer as a discount and buying in. Coupled with all the other theories with what hedge funds and RH (etc.) are doing, we can reasonably infer that these scare tactics are working. I mean, why wouldn't they? We are shitting bricks. I expect more red dildo days. You know what that means right? Stonkies go downsies =  buy the dip.

Financial advice for people who just joined WSB from a degenerate veteran,811,lbbyp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbbyp4/financial_advice_for_people_who_just_joined_wsb/,94,1612343919.0,"**TLDR : Only invest with WSB what you're willing to lose.** 

Recently, there's been a huge influx of people who joined WSB in hopes of making millions of dollars and buying Lamborghinis. I'm here to give you some boring ass boomer advice : WSB is less of an investing subreddit and more of a gambling one. *Sir, this is a casino.* I mean, it's in the name, right? WallStreet **BETS**

Over the last few years that I've been a member, I've seen a lot of people YOLO their life savings on SPY calls and puts and lose bigly. These people are WSB legends, but are also actual retards. 

However, I'd say that a significant percentage of us are *smart* investors. By that I mean that we are financially responsible enough to know not to put all of our life savings into Gourds.

I don't have a financial background, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've been a member of personalfinance and financialindependence subreddits for a while before joining WSB. I'm not asking you to be a degenerate autist and put your money on boomer ass dividend stocks and jerk off over making $2 on dividends a year, but to be a *little* bit more responsible with your money. By that, I mean the following : 

* If you have student loans, try paying back your student loans ASAP since those will fuck with you the most. If you are broke ass shit, and jacked to tits in 200k loans, the last thing you want to do is to take out more loans to gamble on memestonks. See what your minimum payments are and try to hit those and if you have money leftover, you can use that to fuck around with.  
* Save 3 months of rent and food (depending on where you live, I'd say about $3000) in an emergency savings account (or some boomer low-risk ETF like VOO). Do this because if you lose ALL your money, where the fuck are you going to stay and eat? 
* Before throwing all your money in Robinhood, put some in your ROTH IRA since the taxman won't take away a lot of your gains. 
* If you do make hella gains on some YOLO option on Robinhood, save like 20% or whatever that short-term capital gain amount is for the taxman or he'll come back to bite you in the ass. 
* Once you have some emergency cash stored (or are willing to live with your parents), and have made some minimal contributions to your ROTH IRA, aren't swimming in credit card and student loans and can make your minimum payments , you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate.

This isn't an investing subreddit. A lot of us play with money which we are okay with losing. Although, I've made **a LOT more** on RH than I have on the measly 10% yearly gains with my ROTH IRA and 401K, it's nice to see that on red days when the market is drilling into the earth's asshole and all my weeklies will expire worthless, I still haven't lost as much in my other boomer accounts. 

Once you feel like you're in a comfortable enough place in life where your only source of income is NOT your weekly SPY calls, you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate like us. Start off testing the waters by buying a few shares of some of the most mentioned tickers here without doing any DD since **we can't read** and lose some money on shitty stocks $PLTR and $MT.  (Edit: relax fellow palantards, this is a joke. I, too, am a ~~bagholder~~ believer) 

Once you feel like you understand the little intricacies of the market (Bad earnings == stonk fall, good earnings == stonks go up but maybe could go down also, Biden president meaning WEED and CLEAN ENERGY go UP), you can now invest invest in options. 

*Optional : Buy a cheap $0.1 option that is way over the money to understand how options work, what theta decay is, etc*

I like to think of RH as playing roulette, where I just toss a bunch of $$ on hype stocks and hope for the best, but you could also make some safe bets depending on your risk tolerance and actually try to do some DD yourself, but we don't do that here. 

In the late 2020 tech ""crash"" I lost over $5000 on dumb ass tech calls, but it didn't really affect me that much since it was my ""play money"" and *you win some you lose some*. If that money actually meant a lot to me, I'd have been super fucked. So yeah, if you were to get ONE thing out of this post:

**Only ""invest"" with WSB what you're willing to lose.** 

Here's some other lessons I've learned over the years : 

* Don't give stock tips to ANYONE, especially family. (Learned that the hard way, read my previous post) 

* If you're going full retard and investing in penny stocks, stop-loss is your friend. 

Having said that, welcome to WSB.

Is there any precedent to what we are up against?

2. What do we stand to gain at this point? How long do we have to hang tight?
If the shares are not being bought by us but instead by hedge funds... then won’t they be able to recycle the shares enough times to escape at a reduced cost and there will be no squeeze? I’m a retard so I don’t quite fully get this, but people’s comments make me think this is possible. 

3. How can WSB lift the facts up and not just what we want to hear? The sub is so saturated now as I mentioned above. How can we focus on pushing this event to the finish line? We need to unify. I moved my other meme stock positions to GME to fortify the line. 

4. At the very least we had fun doing it, right? I’ve had fun. Gonna keep battling with you tards. Never play with more than you can afford to lose.

&#x200B;

 

Fellow Amazonians:

I’m excited to announce that this Q3 I’ll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.

This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, “What’s the internet?” Blessedly, I haven’t had to explain that in a long while.

Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.

How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.

I don’t know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon’s, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.

As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it’s working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you’re proud of that as well.

I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you’ve been humble. When times have been tough, you’ve been strong and supportive, and we’ve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.

As much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.

Amazon couldn’t be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we’ve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian’s idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we’re flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.

Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.

GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile,17056,lb7ndd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb7ndd/gme_liquidy_is_drying_up_causing_the_share_to/,1656,1612331555.0,"[https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png](https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png)

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

|ACTIVE POSITIONS|HOLDERS|SHARES|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New positions|46|12,880,726|
|Sold out positions|34|3,412,841|

\--

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

Y'all need to calm down; Be Stoic 💎🙏,33,lb7mkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb7mkt/yall_need_to_calm_down_be_stoic/,2,1612331499.0,"“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.” - Marcus Aurelius. 

This is a perspective post. You'll get your gd rockets in the end. 

Pump the brakes. Stop living in the moment every 20mins over and over again. Zoom out, gather yourself, have some perspective. 

I was GLUED to my screens the last few weeks, watching, gathering, celebrating, maddening—but this last week has taught me a lot. The stock price and fluctuation, in this scenario, is not attached to what's really happening. **YOU KNOW THIS.** Now stop panicking when you know they're fucking with you. We've learned that the free market economy, that we've been encourage to take part in, is not all rainbows and roses. What we do know is they're illegally manipulating the price, but it will catch up to them. VOLUME IS NOT MATCHING PRICE SWINGS. 

There's amazing DD done after the markets are closed. Dig around and look for those, they'll give you all the reassurance you need. While the markets are open, that's when the snakes strike. They're tanking the price, the news is infiltrating your brain, you think of losses. But it's all synthetic. 

You need to take care of yourself and be stoic. People who are dropping out and acting out of emotion and instinct, not confidence and understanding. Take a look at our lord and savior, DFV's Twitter: [https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty). There's no panic, no short-term thinking, just fucking swag. He posts kitten gifs and his positions at the end of each trading day. His balls are swelling beyond the size of the moon. That's confidence. He's lost tens of millions in theoretical value this last week, and yet he's stoic. What does that tell you? What does he know that you don't? Find the DD at the end of the days. Look at volume vs price swings. 

This isn't supposed to make sense if you've been following the market for some time now. You'll see your favorite youtube stock investors starting to cave under the pressure because they're still associating the stock price with gains/losses. They are focused on likes, follows, subscribers and that's amplified by big jumps in stock price; of course they'll feel defeated. But OG investors will always tell you that the longer you hold the better off you'll be. You think Warren Buffett threw a party every time Coca Cola went up 5% in a day? No, he was thinking 10-20 years out. We're in a different league now. The rules you once knew aren't applying but there are some underlying truths you have to know, deeply. After that you'll feel so much better. 

Sure we're down 60% today, but I'm feeling better today than I have all week. Because I know something. I invite you to see the truth through all the noise. 

Here are some major resources that have calmed me down. Look to the horizon my friends.

However, if you look at the image, it says the trigger date is 2/1 and the proposed deactivation date is 2/3... doesn't that mean the restriction started yesterday, and will actually end today?

I’m not saying someone should, but the SEC isn’t doing their job and we are paying the price for their negligence. Someone should hold them accountable, only way I see the people can do that is by suing them and holding tight until the Suits stop cheating, cuz we beat them and they’re salty.

We need to hold strong, nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week. 
The media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting. We were 2 million last week now we are 8 million. We have grown in numbers and I’m sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people. But I am certain that we will prevail. We need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by Friday, the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover. 
It is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130% short interest to just 30% that’s fucking impossible. 
1) Up until Friday the short interest had rather increased
2) I know for sure they didn’t fucking trade over the weekend 
3) Retail investors, we are holding a big chunk of those stocks 

Wake up ! They are trying to make us surrender, it is impossible that they have covered their positions between Friday and today. 

Let’s hold the line, let’s get it back to $200-$300 levels. 

We might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up.

DO NOT LET THOSE BASTARDS WIN, WE MUST REMAIN STRONG AND UNITED. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US. 

This is our legacy, we are being part of the history of investing and finance. We can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won. 

We owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits.

However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) (I highly recommend to check out this post on [r/video](https://www.reddit.com/r/video/) featuring his original analysis) this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.

I personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.

Now, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.

Of course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..

What would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.”",2021-02-03 07:40:13

"‘Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories’ - Sun Tzu. A THESIS ON GME",1,lb5muo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb5muo/know_thy_self_know_thy_enemy_a_thousand_battles_a/,1,1612326733.0,"In order to adhere to WSB rules, this post is strictly for discussion purposes and not to instigate or coordinate any market activity.

1. Wall Street 

As we have seen the past two days, Wall Street has certainly created  a plan of action to fuck us over and drive the price down and cover their shorts in an elongated time span which minimizes their losses (even though they pay more interest over time, it will cost less to cover if they slowly cover while driving the price down ~$200+ due to low volume after the first squeeze). At this rate, Wall Street may very well have this squeeze under some control, and may be able to cover their positions without total market catastrophe. This thesis is under the assumption that S3’s data was somewhat accurate (~30M shares short currently) and that the 122% short interest from the end of last week is mistaken as the 122% short interest from Jan 15 (68M shares short according to shortsqueeze.com). This information is crucial as it would mean this thesis is the only way to hypothetically guarantee another squeeze no matter what, because simply holding at 30M shares short very well may leave us as the bag holders (downvote me, idc. Someone needs to validly bring up the elephant in the room before this echo chamber turns even more batshit than Qanon).

2. Supply and demand

Thank you to Mark Cuban for the AMA this morning, as he gave me more insight on how this thesis could work. The price of the stock is determined by supply and demand. Given that demand has dropped since Friday, so has the stock price. This sub has gone full retard trying to drive up demand this week, and it has had little effect on wall street’s plan. The other half of the equation is supply. We have tried limiting supply in one aspect by buying up shares at these high prices, but we haven’t effectively been limiting supply in the most efficient way. All of the OG GME retards loaded up on OTM long-dated calls back in 2020, and those are now all deep ITM. *Hypothetically* exercising them would decrease the supply of shares in a more cost effective manor than simply buying and holding, and raise the market value based on supply/demand, right? (what do I know tho? I barely passed intro to Econ).

3. The unplanned thesis.

We have seen a lot of referencing of the 2008 Volkswagen squeeze and how there’s a dip right before the rip. This does NOT correlate with our current dip, as that week was a brutal week in the market in general. What did cause the squeeze was Porsche announcing its raise in the companies stake, REDUCING SUPPLY. The squeeze occurred purely off of supply and demand. We all saw what happened today when GME dipped hard into the 70’s, the volume was there and the demand was high enough to throw the shorts off of their plan. This forced the hour long spike from people buying and shorts covering, eventually leading shorts to gain control again and rebalance their shitshow situation. I have noticed the unprecedented following that DFV has accumulated in the past few months, and right now he is essentially Tarzan with the amount of smooth brain monkeys he has surrounding him. If DFV were to *hypothetically* informe his beloved followers on his daily YOLO update that he was exercising his april 12c at the next days dip, then the ‘IF HES HOLDING IM HOLDING’ crowd may turn into the ‘IF HES HOLDING AND EXERCISING IM HOLDING AND EXERCISING’ right? Monke see Monke do. This section is not meant to incite market manipulation, as I am purely speculative and opening discussion on the psychological effects and market impact this thesis may have. If ITM call holders coincidentally exercised at the same moment intraday when volume and demand are high, would a massive squeeze occur where shorts can’t get back into their dip/cover daily cycle and are forced to cover it all in a day? I hope the best for us all, and the worst for Wall Street. 

Positions: GME 800c 2/19

TLDR: IF supply were dramatically decreased at a point of high volume & demand (before lunchtime) from a bunch of ITM calls being exercised, then GME would squeeze like we all dreamed of. 

*For legal reasons this post is strictly theoretical discussion and I do not condone market manipulation.

Don't let nihilists set pessimism in your bones.

At the end of the day it's your money, do whatever the fuck you want with it. Also remember billions of dollars are on the line, in my opinion a little bit of suspicion towards new angles emerging to try to convince you all to sell or to redirect your attention isn't unwarranted. But at the end of the day it's likely (mostly) just other normal people. From what I've witnessed these particular people actually say in the comments, condescendingly speaking down to other users, I'd estimate there's a lot more narcissism going on than compassion, the insecure wanting others to emulate their nerves or assuming everyone else isn't as genius as they are to not adopt their cynical take on the situation.

Your path is yours, trust your gut, give em' hell.

1. When does the shorts expires
2. How many shares are expiring at that moment?
3. How much does it cost for each day of delay in the payment?

And the we need to do a graph with these two curves:

* How much will it cost for the short sellers to buy the shorts back given a specific share price
* How much will it cost for the short sellers to delay the payment each day in cumulative

Very capitalist answer, as long as Delaying payment interest < Buying back shorted shares then they will continue this game

They can't buy shorts at 300$, 250$ because that means END OF BUSINESS for them

So they are delaying as much as possible and trying to reduce the share price as much as possible, even if they have to pay millions of interests

their main goal is 1) Having the stock so cheap that when they buy their shorts they ear money 2) If they can't, having to pay back as low as possible

If someone can share the input on this i would be able to draft a data analysis model to try to guess the stock price and the moment when the short might be able to squeeze

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US & more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

You think that holding will make it squeeze. But holding is not enough. The price needs to increase to create a squeeze, so you need to buy.

Last weeks were exceptional. Market makers were unprepared (gamma squeeze) and had to buy stock, which helped increase the price. That won't happen again.

Since market makers won't help your cause (buy), you have to do it yourself. But you all agree that it is priced above fundamental value. So basically you want people to buy an overvalued stock, in the hope that other people buy into an even more overvalued stock.

I was fun while it lasted. I wish the outcome was different and that the price would have gone to $1000+, but the momentum was killed on Thursday.

The fed is still fixing the damage done during Feb/Mar/April with things like Unlimited QE, overnight swap rates at just about 0%, adding of liquidity to the markets with the buying of not only bonds but securities...ect. They are just barely getting it propped up again on bullshit (my opinion they should have let the banks and large corps fail. but that has no relevance on this).

The Fed absolutely could not allow these Market makers to potentially be open to legitimate infinite losses to the point of insolvency.  If the squeeze actually did happen and literally forced one or two MM's / Clearing firms to go under. This would force a huge liquidity problem in the overall markets with Market Makers having to sell off their other existing positions which pretty much keep the market propped up at the moment. There are not many of these MM's so if even one failed it creates a huge systemic risk.

These companies are required to figure out worst cast scenarios like this. So if they are required to figure out the worst case the Fed also knows what the worst case is. 

It would be the literal un-doing of everything the fed has done up to this point. Do you see how many transactions companies like citadel clear? Who would step in to take the place of them if they went under?

Yes I'd absolutely love that to happen because we would get huge discounts on pretty much any value stock we wanted with the mass sell off like in Feb/Mar/Apil. But do you for one second think the fed would actually let that happen again if it could be prevented ahead of time.

Call me a tinfoil hat if you want because maybe this is a little far fetched but I wouldn't be surprised if the fed actually played an active roll in preventing the squeeze from happening by offering suggestions and advice to the companies involved in all of this. They saved the banks in 2008, they saved them again in 2020, why would they not save them this time.

I just don't see a way this would have ended well for the markets as a whole with everything that has been going on after the black swan that was corona. So how could they possibly allow that to happen.",2021-02-03 13:51:34

"How can we counter the ""ladder attack""?",220,lberup,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lberup/how_can_we_counter_the_ladder_attack/,196,1612352822.0,"I'd like to think I'm on the higher end of the spectrum.... But then I remind myself that I am here and that I have yolo-ed my life savings into GME thinking I'd finally be able to get myself out of this hole and buy a moderate house.


It's been a rough couple of days for a lot of us who are involved in GME in one way or another. I'm used to seeing red after being involved in many trades that went sideways (down) since 2004 when I started trading.

The internet community was not as ... Versed back then. It was a little harder to get the information you needed.

That brings me full circle to where we are now.

Something doesn't sit right with me with this whole situation. Not just because my account is red with too many commas. But because I keep hearing that ""these"" people have these ""powerful computers"" that can do things we cannot do.

I don't believe that... I can't believe that. Because that goes against everything I know; it goes against everything we are as people, as humans, and 🐒. We never give up on the face of adversity, we strive to overcome it no matter how great and difficult... Because that is how we grow, that is how we make our lives and the lives around us better. This is how we make it so the world is a better place for the generations that come after.

So how can we mitigate these ""ladder attacks""? What can we do to defeat them? What can we do to use it against them?

I ask this... Because I know many of you out there are a lot smarter than me... A lot more creative... And a lot more knowledge able.

I want to think that this is the way. By collectively solving a problem. This is how we grow isn't it? That is how anyone grows. By reaching out and trying to be better than we were a minute ago.

u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won’t do that again. Now I’ll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

I won’t go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/)

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it’s about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren’t way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i’m bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

That’s obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30’s if I “yolo” on this. I know it’s small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesn’t appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than today’s close

This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead….you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.

Amarin DD,2,lbepxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbepxi/amarin_dd/,23,1612352644.0,"The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe. Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. 
Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...it’s not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! 

There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3’s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it’s it’s powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). 
Think.....“it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb”. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That’s right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! 

Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE—IT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! 
It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. 
Let that sink in a minute. 

Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN’s three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. 

Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! 

Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe’s market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN’s revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 

There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its “Change of control” package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) 

Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It’s truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let’s see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There won’t be a find a chair when the music stops here. 
Your consideration is appreciated.",2021-02-03 13:44:04

The shorts and WSB (with some whales and institutional supports) are fighting neck and neck, but why? 

The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that won’t happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo. 

The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If I’m honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover. 

#WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES 

Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to “let them” win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover? 

Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me. 






#THE SHORTS PLAN 


There’s a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top they’ll buy puts and tank the price again. 


This allows them to 

#Cover 

#Make money on the upswing 

#Make money on the downswing 

#Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base 



#TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.


#PLAY INTO THEIR HAND AND LET THEM THINK THEY’VE WON AND THAT WE GAVE UP. THEN THATS WHEN SHARES BECOME AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO SNATCH UP CHEAPLY.",2021-02-03 13:26:07

DO NOT SELL RETARDS GME TO THE TOP 🚀,1481,lbebfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbebfl/do_not_sell_retards_gme_to_the_top/,108,1612351319.0,"For #GME/#AMC holders/baggers...

What’s about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks. 

The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can’t recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. 

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn’t matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn’t selling at that price. It doesn’t matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. 

Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can’t buy, they can’t close their shorts. If they can’t close their shorts, they’ll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. 

The squeeze starts when the hedge fund can’t afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They’ll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they’ll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn’t the actual price. It’s the price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn’t matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can’t close their positions, they’ll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.",2021-02-03 13:21:59

$CLOV,56,lbe85k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbe85k/clov/,32,1612351040.0,"I read Biden’s National Strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness. There’s a ton of language in there about “strengthening essential data systems”. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may “require new technology”.

Some relevant language from strategy:

“Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.”

“Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.”

Where is all this new technology coming from? 🤷🏽‍♂️

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover’s technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health’s expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient’s information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.,23924,lbe80d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbe80d/gme_and_80_stocks_why_to_not_worry/,2080,1612351027.0," 

>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!

Wrong.

No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

>WHAT?!

You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.

They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.

All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.

I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:

**# of Shares - Price**

x 20 - $0.30c

x 80 - $5

x 400 - $20

x 600 - $40

x 900 - $60

x 2,000 - $100

x 5,000 - $150

x 10,000 - $200

x 30,000 - $300

x 50,000 - $400

x 150,000 - $500

x 1 mil - $1,000

x 15 mil - $5,000

x 30 mil - $69,420

Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.

Get it?

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.

How's it going apes, I've been lurking since the covid market crash, and have recently been seeing a lot of sensible posts that make it seem like the squeeze has squozen, and all of the shorts have been covered. Maybe the media wasn't lying. Maybe the posts are getting into the one wrinkle my smooth brain has left. We'll see.

I'm just posting to see if anyone can reference me to evidence or good DD that can refute some of these ideas, but some of the things aren't adding up.

First things first: This sub has gotten pretty hive mind-y. A lot of the DD posted is grounded in speculation, or the idea that everyone is out to get us and no one is on our side. It's naive, but let's assume no one was lying, and that the media isn't out to get us. They're just lazy and writing easy articles with little to no research for those yummy clicks.

Let's kick this off.

# 1. The Hedgies covered their short positions?

Around the height of the squeeze, the media was claiming that the hedge funds have closed out their short positions. This was refuted by the fact that [short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) hadn't decreased, but potentially increased. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/layb68/rstocks_gme_megathread/glsjpx9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) poses a really good argument as to why this is possible. Basically, it's saying that the jump to 500 was the squeeze, and they re-opened shorts at a better position. That was us winning, the hedge funds cut their losses. We interpreted that as them ""Doubling Down"". Now we're the bagholders, and this ""war of attrition"" will be us slowly selling our shares as more and more of us realize that the game is over.

# 2. Volume! No one is selling! Look at the volume spike and the price spike this morning!

The price spike this morning was the gamma squeeze. The seller of the contract has T+2 days to deliver the shares. They obviously waited for the share price to be as low as possible, because they knew the squeeze was over. We're against people who have much more money and education in this field. Why would they not try to maximize their profits as well? I don't think holding does anything but decrease liquidity. The people buying isn't them, it's us.

# 3. DFV didn't sell! Mark Cuban said to hold!

I haven't actually dug through post / comment history, so correct me if I am wrong. But I think DFV is in it for the long haul, he *genuinely* likes the stock. I don't think his plan was to make a quick buck off of a squeeze. And Mark Cuban said to hold *if you believed in the company*, he said not to sell if your reason for buying hasn't changed. Well, if the squeeze squoze, would that not be the reason changing? I didn't see him reference the squeeze itself, and whether or not we were winning. Rather, *we did the right thing.*

&#x200B;

I hate to be a debbie downer, but I don't drink and I am sober enough to see the party's over. We won, kind of. I'm still balls deep, diamond handing on a wish that GME takes off to the moon. I just need some reassurance, because all the DD in the past couple days hasn't been grounded enough to convince me that we're still in for a ride. Whatever happens, we're in this together.

**Thesis:**

Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well. I can't tell if this is FUD or if they truly believe this. This info is in their daily customer subscription mailers, only actual GS customers get these mailers afaik. I don't know what is the truth anymore.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

* \-Set your sell limits.
* \-SET YOUR SELL LIMITS.
* \-YES YOU.
* \-FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS STRAIGHT.
* \-There's SOME consensus on the sub that realistically it should be \~800. Add a few lottos at 5k and 10k too as some people were lucky to get filled on 3.2k and 5k today. Don't get too greedy or you might not fill.

We've seen how much the MM can manipulate anything... A lot of people believe the lies--the official reports--I've finally resigned to the feeling that I know I'm being lied to... That the enemy still has something at stake here, and that we can profit from it.

This is how the lord of lies works; he relies on you to do what is rational, because facts are the only thing the lord of lies can control...

So, what we've seen isn't a paying down of shorts...

It's the MM manipulating the price to convince you to fold your hand... They put it up to see if you'll cash in... They'll put it down to see if you'll cash out...

I think there will be a big squeeze soon--but the reason won't be because of fundamentals--it will be because the last squeeze didn't get you to fold your hand.

The big question is: why do they have to play against our hand of they can cheat? What we do know is that a lot of shares are coming back with a ""failure to deliver""--meaning these MM are injecting fake shares into the economy; this is all we've known until now...

Another question is: who holds the real shares, and who holds the fake shares?

But where is the thesis about how these fake shares can be used? And why?

For the sake of this thesis, I have to assume that the MM are accountable to the SEC, the government or the banking systems at large\~\~so, if we're to see news break of this, and trials had, it will have to be because the MM couldn't kick the can any further down the road, and their lie was exposed... 📷

There are a lot of people involved in this whole chain of operations. Some people are able to collude together, but the system as a whole can't be all in on one conspiracy together...

What I expect to see, weeks from now at most, is that the MM are exposed, for who they are, and what they're doing--hopefully entirely--and that we'll be closer to exposing the perfidy that has unfolded underneath of us.

There's a reason none of us feel right... Why we feel uneasy, and like we've been cheated--we saw it right before our eyes, and we're gaslighted--and then it all blew over, like everything is normal...

But we still see signs of the fight brewing underneath.

[http://www.sportstwo.com/posts/5089795/](http://www.sportstwo.com/posts/5089795/)

Read this person's post. He talks in depth about ""failure to deliver"" shares... There's a piece missing to this puzzle, and it isn't to do with how much short interest is left...

We keep seeing them pay that down and rebuying into shares for a reason...

There's manipulation there. Probably them manipulating the short interest to combat this narrative that there will be a short squeeze.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the\_ratio\_of\_short\_volume\_to\_total\_volume/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

This guy might be on to something... Something feels like it's missing... I guess my gut says a squeeze can still happen. My mind is fighting me.

So, they're going to hike the price again perhaps end of this week... They'll try to shake you out at $1,000 a share.

This is the thesis... What happens at the end of this?

Let's look at GameStops current metrics.

GameStops current market cap at $90 is $6.5bil.

On last earnings, GME reported $1bil in revenue with -$18mil in net income.

They made $1,000,000,000 in revenue in 3 months, and they need to save $18,000,000 per quarter to turn a profit. Any improvements they make to the operations is going to keep pushing them farther into the green. They couldn't do much worse than last year with the pandemic...

...but instead they are about to have their largest quarter in recent history. Hear me out...

Between the dual-release of the PS5 and the XBOX, console sales will be a huge boost. But that is expected...

The other new market that no one is discussing is Trading Cards. Pokemon and Magic TCG both had a HUGE year. With card shops being shut down, a very large amount of sales went through GameStop because scalpers were clearing out big box retailers.

And GameStop takes pre-orders for them.

My local GameStop put a limit on 20 pre-orders per person so that they could try to guarantee allocation. 20 per customer... And they had to limit it...

GameStop has extra cash in the bank from the PreOrders for the next Shiny Vault Pokemon set coming out... So they actually have cash on the books in advance for this upcoming earnings report. You're going to see a huge surprise.

Their new partial owner, Ryan Cohen, took Chewy up against Amazon and won. And he brought his best team with him to GameStop. GameStop did 35% of their revenue through online sales in October. Wait until RC streamlines it and builds a market around the brand name recognition...

So ask yourself...

Does a $6bil cap company with $1bil in Quarterly Revenue (quarterly...), on the cusp of turning a profit, and with the best online sales team in the market sound like a decent investment to you?

Because that is what GameStop at $90 is...

Hold on my fellow Lennys. The long term looks good from here. $100 is going to be a floor soon. Sky's the ceiling...

Even without a squeeze...

Remember how it's a giant mystery as to who has had a short position on gme and we were just going off a rumor mill for months that it was Melivin (well until Melvin publicly reported almost going out of business).  So it turns out since 2010 when the Dodd-Frank act was signed into law investing managers have been required to to disclose short positions, just like they do their longs.  The SEC just chooses not to implement this.  Considering naked short attacks are what took down the banks in '08 turning that mess into a crisis, it's crazy the SEC doesn't have to respect federal law.  The law itself is giant, but there's also a bunch of public comments on the SEC site encouraging them to actually do their job:

""*The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."" -* ***Sun Tsu - The Art of War***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The above is fitting in so many ways, as are many other famous quotes from a long time ago... We may be in a modernized digital world, but the fundamentals remain the same.

This is a long post, and I apologize but rather than just join the echo chamber, and shout 💎🤲🚀 etc.. Let's take a minute and really assess where we're at and where we've come from. This IS NOT telling ANYONE to 📄🤲 .. Quite the opposite in fact.

As it stands I bought at $325, the night shit really turned pear shaped (on paper) and I watched the initial investment jump up to just short of $500.. I was grinning about it, thinking I'd timed it just right..

Moments later, the market was halted, share buying restricted, prices began to plunge.

And continue to plunge.. day after day.

I have then watched the shit storm unfold between then and now, but I've learnt a BUNCH and become almost addicted to wanting to know more.

&#x200B;

**KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have all heard this a MILLION times in our lives, but it's true. And the more you educate yourself about this current situation, regardless of how it resolves, the more it will help us all in the future. This is just the beginning.

The market will not be the same after this, the SEC investigators, super autistic apes, politicians, billionaires, people from ALL walks of life, and levels of varying smooth brains will look further into this and explain clearly how it all went down. Lap the knowledge up. It will help you in the future as part of WSB or solo.. it **WILL** help.

I mean fuck. Netflix is already making a movie. People will be talking about this for a long time yet as the trade that changed how Wall Street does business. (I agree with all the others too.. give them a happy ending! 💎🤲)

What I'm getting at is this kind of fuckery with the ladder attacks, the blatant FUD campaigns on the media, the bots, the busted brokers, trolls and everything else that has been thrown against you is you learned.

You learned what Wall Street is capable of, what they will stoop to, what to expect next time, how they are doing this, the tactics they use.. And just for a second, place yourself in their shoes.

The big guys have the lifestyle that many of you can only dream about, and if you have that.. you will do \*ANYTHING\* to protect it. The rich don't get rich by being charitable, and sharing their wealth freely with the smaller guys. They get rich by TAKING, USING, and ABUSING and employing any tactic they can to their advantage to achieve their end goal of financial domination.

&#x200B;

**We're different.**

&#x200B;

For the first time, in the history of the internet we  have come together - People say it could have been any company.. But think about this:

GameStop (EB Games for us Aussies) is a place where you STILL go, regardless of Steam, Epic (yuck), GOG, and all the other online retailers..

GameStop shutting its doors, would be similar to when the old arcades (Time Zone excluded..) shut their doors, and became a thing of the past.

How many times have you walked through a shopping center and stopped in to your local GameStop or EB Games and browsed for a gift for a loved one, a quirky new shirt, the pre-owned console games, D&D stuff.. The list goes on.

**GameStop is still relevant** \- And by the luck of the gaming gods **$GME** was the share that the big brains ( Yes, people like /r/deepfuckingvalue ) spotted and deemed to be a good investment.

&#x200B;

Now, think further along - If the stocks were something mundane... like **Gourds** (Fuck off copy pasta bots.. you're mildly annoying and none of us care. We enjoy clicking the 💩 reactions on your repetitive, shitposts)

Do you think the online community would have rallied and banded together internationally to support it? Fuck no.

This is a magical, rare, fucking unicorn of a stock. It's circumstances, and nature of the company tied into a neat little package for us to love and hold.. (forever 💎🤲)

We are gamers, we are tech savvy, we have the ability to open broker accounts online without any previous experience, we know how to research more than just using Google, we are the perfect audience to start a global movement. Which we have done.

So when the whispers of WSB began, and word slowly began to spread around the interwebs, you guys heard it. You took the time to investigate.. and shit post a lot.. and come up with almost a whole new sub culture lingo to go with it (Okay, maybe WSB had that for a long time before the new arrivals.. but we love it)

The point is, you spent time, learned and I implore you to keep learning until that smooth brain.. isn't so smooth.

# We are the perfect demographic and GME is the perfect stock for us and those two factors have lead us to a point where the entire world, gamers or not have become involved. This. Is. Huge.

Right now there is a lot going in our favour - **Do not judge this epic event by the share price alone.**

*Initially I wanted to post pics, graphs, explanations about everything you can readily find online so you would be educated, so you would know that this isn't over yet, far from it in fact. But, the more I look around, the more I see people who just need a nudge to investigate things themselves.*

&#x200B;

**REMEMBER: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER**

&#x200B;

Due Diligence is needed. Invest only what you can afford or risk. No-one can tell you specifically what is best for you so RESEARCH that smooth brain.

I could post a 1000 more links to posts, comments and people doing epic DD, whether they came from a financial background or are just a smooth brain ape who's taken the time to look deeper into it all.. but you get my point.

If you have decided to 💎🤲 and 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon with us (in a week, a month, a year..) then unless you're buying..

&#x200B;

**Put down your phone, stop watching the ticker, and do some research while you hold.**

&#x200B;

Because once the dust settles, and the war is won.. We will move on and find some other greedy assholes and right their wrong. The more smart apes we have, the better it will be next time around.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time, go educate yourself more, it's free and empowering.

💎🤲 until the end. I just like this stock.

You may be thinking what about GameStop, well you're just a f****** autistic child living in his mother's basement... forget about GameStop, that squeeze was ""squoze"".

This is why AMC is going to be the next best thing since sliced bread:
All of the other movie theater companies had already filed for bankruptcy. This leaves AMC Theatres as The Last Man Standing. They just raised over $700M in additional funding which clears them of any short-term bankruptcies up coming 🤑

There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand for entertainments especially Sports and movies. Where is everyone going to go once things go back to normal? They're going to go to the only place left in town and that's AMC 🏚🏚🏠

Well you may be thinking ""This stock was $3 a month ago why should I buy it at $7?""
Because 💎🙌 autists are holding those bags up baby, just buy now or cry later. 

AMC is seen as a value stock versus Gamestop considering the inflated valuations. Dollar for dollar youre better off buying the cheaper of the two, for unit bias and also because...

What you can do with your shares while waiting:

The daily fund requirements brokers have to deposit with their clearing houses increased because GME was too volatile and because there were way more buys than sells at popular brokers. 

Does it mean that if, hypothetically, buyers :

- spread their buys on multiple days/weeks, in order to lower volatility

- move some of the GME stocks they already have from the most popular brokers to other less exposed brokers, in order to lower the quantity of GME held by the more popular brokers and also to make room for newer investors who tend to use popular platforms

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only),276,lbdchj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdchj/lets_talk_about_taxes_both_realized_gains_and/,84,1612348221.0,"I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going 🚀🚀🚀, but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*

Edit 1: Net **capital losses** in excess of $3,000 can be **carried forward** indefinitely until the amount is exhausted.

Thanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I’ve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn’t make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I’ll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I’ve never had any issues with them, and they don’t limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can’t be made. I’m not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don’t feel comfortable with that, it’s okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to “pay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account”. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I’m not an expert. For those of you telling me (with malicious intent) that I’m a retard, tell me something I don’t know.",2021-02-03 12:28:31

Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security ✅

>In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  
>  
>Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.

It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.

Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.

Here's what I mean,

[This is one of the first few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31bke/gme_yolo_update_following_the_q2_earnings_report/) by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.

All other things ignored, do you notice something? **Look at the ""CASH"" pile. It reads: $13,962.21**

Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of ""he hasn't sold"".

I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to [December 17 2020, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf69j1/gme_yolo_update_dec_17_2020/).

Notice something odd? Something remarkable? **The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.**

Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.

Cool, let's move on.

Total $3.6m - Cash pile on [Dec 25, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0g0f/gme_yolo_christmas_update_dec_25_2020/): $1,116,831.85

Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.

DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.

He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the ""Total pile"", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.

You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.

Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.

**TLDR:** You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always ""If he's still in, I'm still in"". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.

The game is up nobody should be putting money into GME right now,86,lbd99k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbd99k/the_game_is_up_nobody_should_be_putting_money/,118,1612347933.0,"Downvote and call me paperhanded me all you want but I'm off the GME Galactic and i've booked a healthy profit from it. 

Not financial advice. 

I wrote this on Monday night after selling on Monday morning but i feel the sentiment still holds true. 

Back in December when i started GME was at around 16. I averaged up to 36.84 last monday but i took out my initial invest when it got up to 447. I sold the rest yesterday at 275. Do i regret not selling when it was 400+? Yes. Am i happy with what i've got? Absolutely. 

At some stage WSB becomes an echo chamber and if you get sucked in you're investing/betting on emotion rather than making logical decisions about what to do with your money. 

Back in December when /u/uberkikz11 and /u/deepfuckingvalue had their posts up with the  proposition for GME being undervalued it was a compelling case and and threw a bit of money in. Q3 ER came in and the SP tanked but i held because the investment thesis hadn't changed. Last monday i sold nearly everything else i had in my portfolio to put into GME so that at the end it was 77% of my entire holdings which i think was the right decision (YOLOL). But after seeing what happened on Thursday and then doing some reading over the weekend i got worried that the train was slowing and decided to sell everything yesterday. 

I don't think that theres anybody who doesn't realise that GME is speculation and if you actually believe that its a good investment i think you're wrong. There was a specific set of circumstances that helped bring GME to where it is now and those circumstances have changed significantly with the limiting of purchasing. 

Back to what i said earlier about WSB being an echo chamber. There were 2m-ish people on the sub on Monday. Now? Its at 8m. Its fucking crazy. I'm not some tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist but you have to at the very least believe that different people will have different agendas and this is doubly so for 7m people. You form your own opinions but if everybody is saying buy then its always a good idea to find reasons not to buy so you have a balanced viewpoint. Even DFV himself when posting up his thesis for GME asked people to critique his logic. If you aren't actively seeking out other opinions you're doing yourself a disservice and you risk getting mired in the ""HLOD"" bog. 

Andrew Left's first hitjob video was a hilarious catalyst but he does say one thing that made total sense - know who is on the other side of the trade. WSBers like to convince themselves that we know what high short interest means but do we actually know? Do we know who is on the other side of the GME trade? I'd recommend going to take a look at some of /u/laminar_flo 's posts. While some of his posts come off as very HF elitist he does make some valid points about Wall Street in general and how Melvin might actually have already exited this trade. So back to the question - do we know who's on the other end of this trade? I think with all the HDOL-ing there are some people who can't hack the volatility and are selling so this means that its just retards selling to other retards on the way down. (as an aside i do actually have to commend Citron's second video. I think he realised that by becoming a predatory short himself he actually joined the establishment and didn't want to be part of it). 

A lot of people follow what other WSBs do on the sub and DFV is our current god and saviour but saying you're not selling if hes still in is silly. He's sitting on $14m, are you? The thing that worried me over the weekend was seeing people throwing in various funds (retirement, wedding, college fund etc) into this trade expecting it to only go up. Yes stonks go up if there is a solid reason for going up and at this stage nobody know if GME will go up down or sideways. You know the story about the shoeshine boys? People YOLO-ing into stocks without any DD are the current version of those shoeshiners. 

On WSB everybody wants to make money but nobody wants to be left holding the bag. Asking others to get in now is irresponsible and people will get hurt from this. The people trying to cajole people to buy the dip or HDLO are essentially asking others to hold the bag while they look for an exit. Don't fall into the trap. 

I could absolutely be wrong. If it goes up to 500+ this week or next i'd be happy for you but at the same time i'm happy with what i have. I'm not keen on the volatility and i think there are better trades out there. 

What have i learned from this whole thing?

1) Have a target in mind and when you get there consider how you'd like to exit. 

2) Don't invest anymore than you can afford to lose. 

3) do your own DD. Read more than one opinion get as many facts as you can and then use those to build a gut feeling.",2021-02-03 12:25:33

Can someone with a knowledge of prob/stats and portfolio risk management explain to me how two days of volume led DTCC to increase RH's deposit requirement by 10x?,53,lbd5vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbd5vx/can_someone_with_a_knowledge_of_probstats_and/,31,1612347630.0,"I know this isn't exactly a WSB type of post, but there has to be someone with expertise doing some bedtime reading.  [Here is a blog entry](https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b) attempting to explain the calculation.

As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but *across the entire portfolio*).

It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the ""99%"" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.

But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the *sell side* becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).

Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.

Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME.",2021-02-03 12:20:30

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Also consider that as volatility goes up, the value of options contracts increase. SPY Puts are a solid strategy in this situation if you can’t buy anymore $GME positions, or are just looking for another way to capitalize.

But... I've been looking at this stock for a while.  Then I saw Silver Lake Group LLC convert their $600 million of convertible notes into equity, so they obviously saw value in the stock at \~$13; That was enough for me to pick up about 1400 shares \~ $15 in January.

The short squeeze could have gone either way, so it was a bet I was willing to make.  Had it gone up to $100 due to a short squeeze I'd be happy - if it got crushed by the HF/Media/RH/Revolut and their manipulative fuckery (which is apparently where we're sitting now) then I'd still hold and grab some popcorn (Hopefully you all have realized that RH was never free, you were their product and we know who their masters are now).  Two years ago this was a $20 stock, and in the last 5 years it's had an ATH of $35.  Predictions are that we're going to see most of the vaccinations occur and a significant lifting of restrictions in time for Summer movie season - and the studios should have some decent blockbusters in the can where we see a big lift to movie theater attendance as us apes emerge from their caves where we have practically lived for 15 months, so assuming AMC stays out of bankruptcy (which is pretty likely at this point), even without a short squeeze this is a stock I can see popping back up to $20-$25 by Fall.  They still have their infrastructure, distribution, recliner seats, IMAX and dine-in options.  AMC is one of the top vendors for IMAX with a potential sector growth CAGR of 34% in 2021 because we're going to see increased customer spending and a demand for a high quality movie experience that Direct to Home (DTH) just can't match.  Lets face it, teenagers are still going to want to take their dates to dinner an a movie.

It's not flashy or as exciting as the GME spike, but long term it's still a good money making opportunity and holding long term or buying the dip still has the potential to see green by the end of the year.  

A lot of HF still have this in their scopes and you can see their short interest is still high, but this is more than just a chance to F the HFs, this is also a good value play on a stock they've been battering.

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”

Also I think the CEO is very motivated to make it work with 5 million in shares being locked up until the stock can reach $16-20 over a 10-day trading average. Also the sweet sweet $90 mill if he can get the stock to $30 before November of 2023.

While I don’t think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think it’s a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday

But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.

Not financial advice.

Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)

Edit2: Saw some talk about Ford ditching QNX but it looks like they will still support Sync (and Apple Car Play) in new cars so not sure how that's going to work

How could you have? And yet here we stand in the early acts of an epic, with Hollywood fighting to tell a story that has barely begun.

Community.

Wallstreetbets has not and will never be just one individual, rather a collective of ideals and goals greater than the sum of its parts. Reddit is the soapbox that allows these diverse individuals to amplify messages that resonate with them with their votes. That does not mean this is political -- Wallstreetbets has never and will never be political.

The financial system has always been shrouded in mystery and complexity, on purpose, to keep the golden goose beneficiaries entrenched. We’ve especially seen it in action the last few weeks, where fairness and the now apparently idealistic thoughts of a level playing field have gone out the window as traders’ control of their own investments was wrested from them. We see the users, we see the quality of the content, and we’re here to evangelize on your behalf. The struggle will be long and arduous. But we’re in it if you’re in it with us. Let’s get it done you amazing degenerates.

With that, a couple of our moderators have shared their personal thoughts on Wallstreetbets and the world we find ourselves in at this juncture.

Thoughts from /u/zjz 

For a long time retail traders have been crabs in a bucket. Working alone with slow and limited data, crappy tools, bad execution, and worse advice. We used to be stuck listening almost solely to pre-approved narratives from people who already made it and wanted us to hold the bag. We used to be a bunch of duck-sized horses.

I don't think this is a continuation of OWS. This isn't *really* political. For our newfriends, WSB was never political. It isn't solely a battle between the rich and the poor, and it's not an attack on *the system*. It's just the next step for retail and it's obviously scary to someone. We don't need to occupy anything, this subreddit and communities like it are soon to be the 1,000lbs gorilla in the room and we're just not quite sure how to stand yet. Retail money has always loomed large, it's just never had so much information and made most of its own decisions before. It was (mis)lead by hack analysts and at best had to huddle in index funds for safety.

When we come together on platforms like this with similar goals, similar tools, and similar data, we become a force that can, even without any centralization, coordination, or deep pockets, easily destroy well-funded opponents and cause them to have to break the rules just to stay alive. Random people that have never spoken before buying GME for reasons ranging from ""haha brrr"" to 30 page writeups can cause spikes that can nearly bankrupt the kind of people that aren't used to being the ones on the losing end. They're used to being the only ones with a big stick.

This is only going to accelerate unless the other actors in this space rig the game in their favor even further **or trick us into destroying the means by which we can sit at the table**. You notice how many circuit breakers there were on the way up vs the way down? Don't accept anything that limits our access to equities, options, futures, etc. Raise hell if they try.

In order to function we need to figure out how to cram as many monkeys on as many typewriters as possible. We need to figure out how to make sure the whole sub sees what those monkeys write, we need to filter noise from signal via millions of self-interested actors. We need to figure out how we can avoid being outmaneuvered by people who will not play fair. We've got problems to solve and there will be growing pains, but we've all got a chance to be part of something that hasn't existed before. Something between a fund, a social network, a union, and an API. Work with us on improving this place and getting settled into this mode of operation instead of breaking into pieces. They'd love that. Apes apart weak.

Nobody should blame you if you love the stock or sold the stock. You should be here to make money. There will be a next time and a time after that. They can only cheat so many times before it catches up with them, they only have so many brains on the task, and we're only getting bigger.

If you’re still reading, thank you. I’m last because I’m least important. If you only skimmed the above content, fuck you. Go back and read it.

Please give all of our mods a shout out and remember to do your part by following our subreddit rules.  As a reminder: We’re all volunteers, and we do NOT accept donations. We appreciate the sentiment in wanting to donate to us, but it would be great if you donated to a charity in our name instead.  (Check out https://www.charitynavigator.org if you want suggestions)

**I’ve been here since the sub was <2000 members.** It really didn’t hit me on how crazy everything was getting until I checked Twitter last week.

Regardless of our personal political views, let’s marvel at the fact that Ted Cruz, AOC, Trump Jr, Chamath, Musk, Cuban, and countless others from various backgrounds and viewpoints agree so strongly on a single topic. We’ve had everything from fractional share owners to multi-millionaires band together because they like a stock. We’ve been in the news cycles nonstop, and there’s even tendies commercials.

Memes aside, things have been shitty for individual traders. Recent events have highlighted how skewed the game has been towards institutional traders. Whether or not there was any intentional wrongdoing, the inherent biases for a hedge fund being bailed out by another hedge fund and ALSO being a major contributor to a large portion of a brokerage’s earnings is kinda fucked up. While I’m not smart enough to say whether the game is 100% rigged, it certainly doesn’t look good. The US government breaks up monopolies for this very reason, don’t they?

The institutional investors claim we don’t know what we’re doing.  I’m just an artist myself, but there are a ton of you here, old and new, who are well-educated and actually do proper DD. 
Despite that, hedge funds continued to freely trade while retail traders were locked out. We’re showing them we can make decisions with our own finances, but institutions don’t like that. They enact laws and force emergency actions to “protect” us when the reality is that it limits our ability to compete **fairly**. Can someone explain to me how Pattern Day Trading protects the retail investor? Can someone explain to me why an individual must have > $1m in assets to be an accredited investor? 

There’s an opportunity in front of us -- We have a chance to make a difference and maybe level the playing field. There are government hearings on Feb 18th, and we have politicians from ALL sides offering to look into what happened. **We even have billionaires like Mark Cuban and the Winklevoss Twins speaking out against this unfairness.** Regardless of what happens, I’m just thankful that I got to be here from the start. Our jungle may be bigger, but it’s been the same bananas the whole time.

So what now? We have an opportunity to change the game. We need to move away from a system with power in the hands of the few to one where power is in the hands of the many. The alternative is that we stay where we are now, where the fate of retail traders is at the whim of archaic institutions. Where they can arbitrarily halt stocks and shackle the free market.  Why can I Cashapp someone for feet pics in *seconds*, but it takes TWO WHOLE DAYS for shares to be delivered from the DTCC?  Why do they also get to choose what the deposit requirements are? Something needs to change, and I’m certain we’re not limited by the technology. We’re limited by the people.",2021-02-03 12:00:26
33% of the 30 minute price markers on GME since Thursday have ended on exact or near exact whole number prices (Ending in .00).. This is almost statistically impossible.,2204,lbcr4r,https://v.redd.it/v11d0ddd66f61,174,1612346379.0,,2021-02-03 11:59:39
"VW 2008, GME and you Autists",185,lbcr7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbcr7c/vw_2008_gme_and_you_autists/,73,1612346384.0,"Alright you Apes listen. Gotta combat some of this shit.

I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position. 

They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.

First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $352.00 I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop. 

Sorry if this hurts your feelings.

So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.

Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain. 

In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover. 

Now I already hear your stupid screeching ""BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!""

Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.

Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.

Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.

To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.

Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%

And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.

The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.

This caused the short squeeze from hell.

Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.

Anyway, besides that fact I want to get some insight on what your plans for the next few days are? 

First let me start off by saying that I have not sold a single share of GME OR AMC. I am holding both. But I did have 55x $5 calls for AMC that I sold on expiration day (Jan 29th) which netted me a very healthy profit. 

I feel as if the true squeeze has not yet even begun. In the back of my mind I have this crazy theory that the market makers and hedge funds deliberately and illegally drove the price down for one main reason. They now want to be apart of the squeeze as well. 

I mean from a financial standpoint why would they not want to make thousands of % of gains? When instead they can only make 100% when they short. 

They are starting to realize the true power behind this movement, they know that it is not going to be easily stopped and the main squeeze is inevitable.

Now what do bagholders do? Well frankly you have 2 options here. Option #1 is, continue to hold your bags patiently and wait until the moon. Option #2 continue to hold your bags and wait until we land on fucking Pluto 

Now there is also a option #3 and that option is to close your position and take whatever money you have left and run. This option sucks donkey ducks. And in turn will probably cause you life long depression when and if we squeeze to astronomical heights. 

Now, I say this with a heavy heart, but if you sold.... Your a bitch. If you feel stupid for buying in, then you probably are. We all know what the risks are. Who buys a stock that goes from $2 to $500 in a matter of days and then wonders why it dropped? You, you bitch. Do not be clueless, do not let this demotivate you. You don’t lose until you sell. You still have your shares. Doesn’t matter what you paid for them at this point because if you bought at $500 you 10000% were not planning on selling at $525 or even $575. So nothing here has changed. Wait until the real squeeze. 

And if all else fails, well you can look back and say you were apart of history. Not that anyone is gonna give a fuck. Anyways fuck you all. Thank you. And so long! Much love!! ❤️",2021-02-03 11:53:29

"$GME, what comes next?",213,lbcin7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbcin7/gme_what_comes_next/,83,1612345646.0,"Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.

The shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME >100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.

That's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.

Now, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?

When the share price drops, 3 things happen:

1. paper handers sell
2. diamond handers buy
3. short sellers must cover

As prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.

This is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ❤️

A theory on hedges and a possible squeeze.,126,lbchto,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbchto/a_theory_on_hedges_and_a_possible_squeeze/,40,1612345575.0,"One theory I have been batting around my head. 

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn’t a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldn’t they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.

The ""circuit breaker"" is triggered for a security any day the price declines by 10% or more from the prior day's closing price

The alternative uptick rule, which permits short selling only ""if the price of the security is above the current national best bid."" 

The rule applies ""to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day.""

IT wasn't a technical problem, it wasn't a volume issue that overloaded the system. It was people like you and me that were pushed off the field when we were playing our best. We learned that every single time you have ever entered a trade, they were waiting, watching to see if they could push us off the field should the situation call for it. It's a dirty game. We played it as well as it could be played. Now, please, take a break.",2021-02-03 11:37:49

You guys are paper handing $GME because you haven't seen the squoze yet and are worried the company is worth nothing,3680,lbc758,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc758/you_guys_are_paper_handing_gme_because_you_havent/,330,1612344639.0," Most of you retards in GME got in when the stock already jumped several times from where it was 8 weeks ago. You're all shouting Wall St is preventing the MOASS through manipulative actions (they definitely are). However you're all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process.

**We didn't invest in GME because the shorts were over 140% of the float and wanted to punish Wall St**

If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play, *the short squeeze was just the cherry on top*. I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.

**So what changed about Gamestop?**

In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with **Amazon**. Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aimé, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.

**Valuation**

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.

Here are some facts:

Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had **300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales**. Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.

Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly **$200 Billion** and slated to grow double digits YoY.

[There is a great DD written by a VC on why Gamestop is going to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/)

>This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.....This is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.

To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.

So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor. 

**TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.** 

P.S. For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income.

The GME Short Squeeze & PLTR Black Friday (for new apes only),128,lbc6hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc6hz/the_gme_short_squeeze_pltr_black_friday_for_new/,19,1612344588.0,"Gather round retards and let me tell you the story of Palantir Black Friday and how sentiments then mirror sentiments now with the massive GME dip.

In the days leading up to Black Friday, PLTR was ripping, easily projecting to break the $40s. But what happened you say? Yes, Thanksgiving happened and although momentum did not actually slow down, sentiments did. People realized how much tendies they were getting and decided to take profit. Yes we all know that shitron and the subsequent downgrades were the primary catalysts for PLTR’s dip and its month long sideways trade. But the profit taking due to a day of market closure realized while eating turkey with family was a secondary reason.

Everyone believed that the weekend after Black Friday would cool negative sentiment and it was just a minor dip but boy were we wrong. That baby dropped to $22.

After that, PLTR traded sideways for all of December, setting itself up for nice wedges but never happened. Thousands of accounts were wiped.

How does this relate to you and the GME squeeze?

The weekend happened. Everyone thought this was the week of reckoning, but it wasn’t...so far. Just because the hive mind here thinks something will happen and even if all the TA points to a breakout, that doesn’t mean it will and in fact, the opposite can happen. Like the other posts have said, the market does not care if all of your stars aligned and certainly will not move to confirm your biases. There is no defined time limit for how long the hedges can last and they can most likely outlast you unless you play your cards correctly.

With that being said, I DO believe the squeeze is yet to come with the stipulation that we collectively hold.

TLDR: Know your risk tolerance, listen to the apes here...if you dare. Hold GME till we bankrupt the hedges.",2021-02-03 11:29:48
Cohen still has the opportunity to buy another 7%. Seems like a great price to do so.,225,lbc6aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc6aa/cohen_still_has_the_opportunity_to_buy_another_7/,60,1612344570.0,"A while back I read a [VERY good DD Post](https://redd.it/l0czgs) by u/FatAspirations talking about how big of a player Cohen truly is in all of this. Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:

* Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of GME Shares

He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?

Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?

Edit: 7% would equate to about 5M shares of a 70M Float, if my maffs right. But am retard.

GME's Data irregularities,1320,lbc5gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc5gq/gmes_data_irregularities/,145,1612344497.0,"Today, I found another irregularity in GME's data. When I looked at the position-cost distribution chart for GME after today's close, I was expecting it to be very different compared to yesterday's chart, since assuming paper hands have sold, they would change this distribution significantly (and today's volume SEEMED to be high). However, I found something fascinating: today's chart was a super-set of yesterday's chart! In other words, it looks like some shares were added to the float and it looks like almost none of the previous shares has moved (diamond hands goes here)!

Take a look:

[Position cost distribution comparison between 2\/1\/21 and 2\/2\/21](https://i.redd.it/33hacgf7p5f61.gif)

Webull's description of what this chart represents is the following:

[Source: Webull](https://preview.redd.it/1s38i8iyp5f61.jpg?width=1061&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8284c1f5a164eb17d77b32a28ffccee8bf79ad42)

If I'm reading this correctly, this means two things:

1. It looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float!
2. People actually seem to be diamond handing!

I can see four possible explanations for the new shares (add a comment if you see other possibilities):

1. GameStop offered shares: this didn't happen as far as I know!
2. An institution that had shares that weren't in the float sold his shares: I can't find any filings, especially with this many shares, but there could be a delay
3. Short sellers borrowed shares that were not in the float (which probably were covered and returned before) and shorted them again.
4. Naked shorting!

The reason why I think 1 and 2 are unlikely is that almost all of the sell orders I saw today were trying to bring the price down, so an insider or an institution that is not short probably wasn't the one selling (they are also probably in a blackout period, but I'm not sure)!

I think 3 is more likely than 4, so I think someone was shorting the shit out of GME today, increasing the short interest considerably.

But here's the thing: at the end of the day, these new shares seem to be not that many, and the same chart seem to be showing that all of the previous shares are already locked, I think these shares will be locked in a few days/hours as well (if they haven't been locked already). So this somewhat guarantees a close to infinity short interest. Furthermore, given that all of these shares were shorted at a relatively low price, so I believe that whoever did (is doing) this, is just digging his own grave! I'm not sure if this continues or not (depends on how many shares they can borrow from institutions), but it made me feel better to see people don't seem to be paper handing that much!

PS. I wish Webull would put a proper X-axis on this chart, that would be very useful!

PS2. To SEC/Government agencies: It seems like you don't care about the retail investors, but let me give you another incentive: if you don't stop these short-selling morons from blowing themselves up over and over again, I think you might end up having a legitimate market crash/financial crisis on your hands! It doesn't matter how much money these folks have, since these guys are at mercy of the shareholders: the supply of shares is EXTREMELY low and the demand is EXTREMELY high (even though the brokerages have artificially reduced the demand for now). From what I'm seeing on this sub (and from the data), people don't seem to have plans to sell below $1k-$10k per share (I wouldn't be surprised if that moves up to $50k-$100k per share if GME SP reaches $1k-$10k), do the math yourselves!

 **Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares. I also added a few weekly calls today!**

EDIT:
tldr;
It seems like today:

🐻 attacked

EDIT2:
Someone said there is another possible explanation: call writers might have dumped their shares if last week’s expired calls were canceled (if they hedged them earlier).

That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M? 

&#x200B;

DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory. 

HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND ""I"" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF

""I"" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play.

Also the SWEEPING DOGSHIT MORALE needs to stop. This sub went from 

&#x200B;

"" BUY BUY BUY BUY EVERYONE BUY"" 

to:

""Wow everyone here has such high expectations you shouldn't be taking this unsatirically and you should only afford to play with what you lose."" ""Here's a gambling hotline"" ""Wow what a dumb play""

No one here, on twitter, Wall St, or even Mark Cuban really cares how many shares you have.  Seriously, when the dust settles, no one cares.

The hedges played us so hard that they have played themselves.,1635,lbbur3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbbur3/diamond_hands_listen_up_gme_is_on_sale_right_now/,170,1612343574.0,"\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports.",2021-02-03 11:12:54

I think the HF's are leaving the writers of the 800c 2/5 options as the bag holders.,267,lbbshu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbbshu/i_think_the_hfs_are_leaving_the_writers_of_the/,80,1612343381.0,"Imagine you are an HF that shorted this stock to oblivion, and a bunch of retards come into a long position raising the price by 1000%. The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.  


What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this? 

1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap. 

2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options. 

3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.   


Proof:   
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  
Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...

That is 2.85 million shares. 2.28 Billion dollars worth at that strike price. 

With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.  


Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying 2.28 Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze. 

TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.

 No. No it is not.

Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards. 

That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up. 

Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It’s a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here’s why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means… well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I’m thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children can’t get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

TLDR:

Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better.",2021-02-03 11:03:13

When you get the certificates guard them with your life because they will be worth allot.  

Here are the steps for u idiots:

1. Send instructions to your brokerage firm to mail out GME certificates to your home 

2. Sell covered calls slightly higher than the market price for your AMC, BB or any other stonk you own 

3. Use the income from the covered calls to buy more GME stock, if you like the stock and have those sent home. 

4. Order a game from game stop before the end of the day, because they sell great games. Get someone to help you with the math if you can't figure out what happens next. Real diamond hands sleep with their certificates under their pillow.

Canadian authorities gonna investigate in the case of GME because of market manipulation as the stocks felt below 100$.

May be just maybe let the basic system of a free market work and let supply and demand find a price without restricting the one or the other. You don’t need a degree in Economics to tell that the price go down if you cripple the whole bid-side.

Or May be don’t halt the stock 50 times on the way up while you only halted a few times when it does the same movement it’s way down. 


Now the boomer media coming after this fraudulent activities with „we told you so“ and blaming the „Reddit investors“ for the plunge and stating that their loss their interest and are selling now. When dump shorter shorts more than 100% of the available free float and are not willing to pay the price, then the side of the trade is evil and dump for doing a rational good trade? 

Fuck this free market. It’s only a free market as long they win. If they start to lose in this Game they change the rules, the referee choosing their side, and the camera man on the field doesn’t Films the fouls of them.

Inspired by Marc Cuban who said to hold long term, here is a quick calculator for you on how much dip you need to buy to end up in the green long term:

S1 = current average purchase price
S2 = dip price
ST = target average price
NC = current number of shares
X = number of shares to buy

(S1*NC + S2*X) /(NC + X) = ST

X = (S1*NC - NC*ST) / (ST - S2)

Cost to pay: X*S2

__________________________
Example:

Current 10 shares at 200$ 
Assuming GME dropped to 1$
Target average price of 2$

X = ( 200*10 - 2*10)/(2-1)= 1980 shares

Cost to pay: 1980*1= 1980$

New position: 1990 shares @ 2$
Total investment: 3990$

Now wait for GME to tick from 2$ to 3$ and you are in the green

Have fun

This is not financial advice. This is not legal advice. I legit think I must be deep one way on the spectrum cause i like it here. 

Remove emotion from this if you can. I recommend /r/Stoicism. There are posts there already addressing this situation.

The Shorts are simply preparing (unsure if it's all legal but whatever, I'm trying not to visualise them as human as much as they are simply the other side of the equation. Also, punitive damages at this stage is still a drop in the ocean compared to handling this situation as best as fiscally possible.  They know their pushing the law too and it should be good news for a Long position to see this. If you've ever been through a legal process, you know when the other side is pulling out ridiculous shit that they reek of desperation).

The deeper we get into their play book, the better. 

The key battles were igniting this whole thing, which we did, and the other one last Friday to get those calls ITM, which we did. This past Monday and Tuesday is not as important mathematically as those key events. Sure, $360->$90 looks like a win, and in some ways it really is a win for the shorts. Just like how the Longs have notched a few good battles too. I mean no shit, they're a pretty good opponent, right?! 

**tl;dr: The other side is preparing as best they can. What else would you expect? Remove your emotions.  The other side is in damage control. Unless you seriously expect them to get this to zero, why wouldn't you hold? The more legal lines they cross, the better.

The Truth about the State of the Sub,1922,lbbfcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbbfcs/the_truth_about_the_state_of_the_sub/,329,1612342275.0,"Ok guys, I’m happy about what has happened with GME, and the rest of the BANG stonks, honestly. It’s inspired a real look into the inner workings of the markets, and fucked over some hedge funds who were more likely than not doing shady things. If any legal victories come of this, whether they create limits on shorting to be under 100% of float, or not allowing market makers to double dip, whatever it is, there may actually be something positive that comes from this on that front. 

That being said - this isn’t only a GME sub, and I’m not here for a fucking cause, to make some political statement, or cry about manipulation all day. You know why a lot of the original people joined this sub years ago? It was to make fuckin money! Share non conventional ideas, go balls deep on some wild plays, YOLO on earnings, share the memes, win or lose with my retarded brothers in arms. If you made money on GME and rode the wave then I’m genuinely happy for you. If you use a real broker and shorted GME at 420 because that’s how you were going to make your fucking tendies, I’m also happy for you. We’re losing our luster and anything else that’s not GME and co is getting downvoted to shit or drowned out. 

You know what this sub isn’t about? The information echo chamber and hive mind bullshit that pervades the rest of Reddit. I actually hated Reddit and made an account years ago but really only got into it because of this sub. You post some conspiracy theory bullshit about how every institution is conspiring to ruin the retail traders because GME is down today? Fuck you, you’re a fucking idiot because the reality is more institutions actually made money off of this rocketing up than lost by shorting against it. Who did we hurt? 3 hedge funds? Fuck guys come on. You know how much big money was behind this move too? It’s just as plausible that all the bots people are worried about are actually from longs, convincing everyone to stay in so institutions can unload the bags onto retail. In fact, it’s actually more likely because like I said, there are more of them on our side who rode the wave up, than the 3 we hurt by it going up. Ever fucking think of that? 

I expect better, and there’s nothing wrong with having more people in the sub as someone who’s been here since like 300k. But you gotta actually cut the shit and put real effort into some of these posts, and know that it’s not about conspiring against the world of institutional investing. It’s about making fucking money - that’s it. 

Wanna know what the best thing about the investment world is? If you don’t like a fucking trade, you can take the other side of it, or you can not play it at all! We used to have people that bet against each other on the reg, and you know what’s beautiful about that dynamic? We shared our losses and our victories and owned up to it, together. It wasn’t a conspiracy sub, it was a sub of autists who won and lost together, even if they were on different sides, with the end goal of get rich or die trying. You would all learn from looking at the history of the sub and some of the quality we used to have. Please, for the sake of keeping this an actually good community, chill the fuck out.

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

&#x200B;

HOLD TODAY

HOLD TOMORROW

HOLD FOREVER

IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.

&#x200B;

THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last ""WSB"" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.",2021-02-03 10:47:12

Cannabis stocks have turned into STONKS - my smooth-brain DD,175,lbb9qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbb9qk/cannabis_stocks_have_turned_into_stonks_my/,94,1612341778.0,"Listen here my fellow retards, my patience is running out on giving you free advice. I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON 🚀🚀

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... ""this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!"".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  💎🙌

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

**TLDR**: Cannabis STONKS  🚀🚀🚀🚀. Exercise your 💎🙌 and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks.",2021-02-03 10:42:58

You’re feeling pretty down, but guess what - it’s OK, we’ve all been there! Chances are every other successful investor out there have made mistakes in the past at some point, but you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again if you want to become a billionaire stock trader. You just need to think about the lessons you’ve learned over this and try not to make them again. Seriously, most of the shit i do is a result of knowing what NOT to do vs. being successful at something.

For reference, here are some lessons I’ve learned over years of making dogshit mistakes investing:

* have a system and stick with it (i.e. screen stocks and make sure you only buy stocks with 20% insider ownership, a business model you understand, etc).
* have an exit strategy. If or when are you planning on selling?
* how would i feel about the volatility about this investment? If it dropped 50% would i pull my money out?
* talk through large investing decisions with a really good friend or partner. Get them to poke holes in your theories... you might find what made sense in your head actually was dumb as hell.
* trade in a tax efficient vehicle so you don’t get dinged by the IRS.
* if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is (i once literally bought speakers out of a van with my last $300, and they didn’t work... just lmao).
* chances are all this time dedicated to this whole stock thing isn’t worth it because investing 100% in VTI will beat your picks most years (and you’ll be a lot less stressed out)
* people like Chamath, Portnoy, Cuban, AOC, Cruz, are just inflating their own ego and Twitter clout by appearing like they’re on one side vs another. They actually don’t give a shit about you.

Anyway, just wanted to throw out a note for those not feeling that great right now. I see you and feel for you and we’ve all been there 🤠. Maybe some other WSBers can share lessons or war stories to help other newbies.",2021-02-03 10:41:29

What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), [Amazon](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-and-amazon-web-services-partner-on-ivy-tech-for-your-car/), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX. (*New info as of 2/2/21 at bottom*)

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

Black Berry Call volume is [exceedingly high](https://twitter.com/ACInvestorBlog/status/1356314928446103554?s=09) this month, possible that the big boys know something?

DD on APHA,207,lbaww3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaww3/dd_on_apha/,87,1612340697.0,"I think it is time I make a DD post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk. I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

This is for new people getting intimated by the volume today and seeing it was higher compared to yesterday and are wondering why the price is still down. What happened on open was a decline downwards all the way down to $70-80 running on LITERALLY the same amount of volume yesterday at around 20-30 million, but as it hit $70-$80 you beautiful fuckers 🦍💎 didn’t sell but instead gobbled that shit up all the way to $140 hence the spike in volume. When it went down again to $90 at closing you can see that the volume is also low similar to the decline at open. *Theoretically if they just kept reducing the price and no one bought but held we would have closed lower than $90 and would have definitely closed with close to the same amount of volume as yesterday*. I feel like people are missing the fact that it didn’t just go down in price it also went up.

"The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling. GME 🚀🚀",8637,lbavu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/,619,1612340604.0,"Many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial, multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders, etc. The official data are in complete agreement with that. S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been > 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more. **GME to fucking Orion's belt 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**",2021-02-03 10:23:24

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.

So that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.

So I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will.

An emotional trader must, above all else, think of the repercussions their investments may have on the world at large. Could you really sleep at night knowing that you are personally funding terrorists or child exploitation?

**The answer is no.**
____

The impact buying or selling shares has on other people is often conveniently overlooked. Mainstream investors, teachers, and self-proclaimed gurus choose to ignore the broader implications of these interpersonal interactions out of moral convenience. To them, that which is not seen, can do no harm. This culture of permissiveness is in violation of human dignity. Every trade that is made, every contract that is processed, is a personal transaction, that of which dates back to Babylonian times. The biggest implication of the result of this shift in perspective surrounds the idea of bag holding.

**Outside of the world of finance, bag holding refers to a form of common courtesy.** That is, if you were to perhaps see an elderly woman holding many bags of shopping, one might partake in bag holding such that said elderly woman was disencumbered.

In the realm of investing, this socially positive term has been *twisted* to refer to traders who refuse to sell shares cheaply. This term is often employed by market manipulators as well as losers who sold and are looking for reaffirmation that they are not alone in their losses.

An interpersonal perspective helps an outsider understand what the emotional investor is doing, and sheds light on the concept of bag holding. Once again, human behavior imitates life. Kind-hearted individuals hold the metaphysical bags of those who cannot afford to (the “old women” in this metaphor). That is, those who are strong, have more wealth available to trade, take on the burden of those who cannot, the old women.

Indeed a cold, heartless view of  markets and investing may lead some to believe that it is okay to let old women struggle and fail whilst attempting to cross the street carrying groceries. However, experienced investors will attest to the moral duty we as humans must carry in the advancement, not only of ourselves, but of the weakest among us.

**Life changing realizations of this nature have powerful impacts on our lives.**

As a coping mechanism, I suggest to you that **crying** is the most efficient method of displaying sadness and sorrow in these situations, **not selling**. Sobs are a universal sign of distress, discontent, and loss. As such, tears may be seen as a commodity. Although an emotional investor will, at all times, avoid selling, and above all else, avoid being a loser, there are particular situations where there simply may not be a lesson to exchange for the sale of your position. That is to say, there may be nothing to learn.

_____
**TLDR**

In days like today, an intelligent well-trained emotional investor will fall back to basic principles of loss aversion and exchange their losses for their value equivalent in tears. In fact, tears may be the most valuable commodity of all. **Only losers sell**. Serious investors learn. Serious investors **cry**.",2021-02-03 10:15:46

If there is a short squeeze here is why it will happen before the 9th.,253,lbaobk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaobk/if_there_is_a_short_squeeze_here_is_why_it_will/,124,1612339982.0,"So before I start. I AM retarded. I may be wrong and this is not advise at all to buy or sell.

That being said here is why I think that the squeeze, if it’s real, will happen before the 9th

BACKGROUND;


When this whole thing started, it started because many traders realized the potential for there to be a squeeze, when realizing this, the stock sky rocketed to my anus and Uranus and everyone’s anus. The important thing to note is that this happened because of a mix of gamma and short squeeze (But not THE wet dream short squeeze everyone is referring too)

When / if the squeeze happens there won’t be a run up like before, most people who are hyped about this already bought. (there is only so much money in traders accounts)

it will likely happen in waves of huge green dildos as companies rush to buy back before another short company buys first and raises the price for them.

They will all try to fight each other because if one company buys back, they are screwing over the others. Which means waves of price increases


What does this have to do with the 9th?

Well on the 9th we will see how many shares are shorted, looking back at how this all started we see it was because of people realizing short interest was high. 

TWO SCENARIOS:


Scenario 1;
 
If on the 9th people see they haven’t covered their shorts or only partially covered and the short interest is still high then the buying frenzy will re ignite and the price will shoot as people wait for the short squeeze.

This is very bad for the company. This means that if the short interest IS high then they would want to buy back before the 9th that way people don’t have much time to react and raise their limit sells when they see the short interest percent. 

Scenario 2; 

Short interest is low and we are fucked. Not much to be said here. No short squeeze


One last thing. The squeeze (if it happens) will happen after a red day because these companies will want to lower the will of shareholders as much as they possibly could to incentivize them to sell at the first sign of green


TLDR: when monkeys see numbers of short interest on the 9th one two things will happen

1: it’s high and the squeeze begins before the numbers are revealed so monkey can’t react.

2: bulls are fuk",2021-02-03 10:13:02

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices

   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

You're at a loss? No point selling now that takes you out of the game (therefore no chance of winning) you have nothing to lose at this point.

Volume is high as fuck still so they are forcing the price down artificially. No question. So when their shorts come home to roost, the price will literally rocket up as long as everyone holds (diamond hands 💎✊)

It might not be tomorrow it might not even be until Friday maybe even next week but you've got to be patient that's why you don't invest money you need because you might just lose it. Both GME and AMC will go up. (Looked at AMC's numbers closely tonight I think we are close to launch off)

AMC is a great stock anyway and after the pandemic it will naturally rise back up to $25/30 (I'm currently 50 shares deep at $9.50. (That's about a profit of $750 WORST CASE SCENARIO)

It takes several days before the information is published and by that time, the number of shares short in the market may have already changed.""

Short likely were covering as the price increased. Now I agree that GME was manipulated and if it were not it likely could have run to 1K while other stocks may have run up higher too like AMC. However I really hope everyone understands that GME likely never sees those highs again. Furthermore this spamming of ""Hold"" is probably making the majority of WSB lose money.

All in all the squeeze was right and the manipulation did happen but the top was last week and it's not coming back.",2021-02-03 10:03:02

While these battles rage on there are many more. While I fully support the GME & AMC run I noticed the new steam brewing about a silver squeeze. 

The idea of a silver squeeze was quickly turned down and here at WSB due to Citadel owning many calls on SLV and other tickers. 

But we must notice the bigger picture here, JP Morgan is a huge player in the manipulation of these commodities and they should be held accountable.

They are just as bad as citadel, we must remember the message behind the run ups on GME AMC and more. This same message might actually apply to silver. I think it might actually be worth looking into brothers, this is a potentially good choice, that’s all I’m asking is for you to double check the situation of silver.

$MGNI: Why it is STILL a great time to buy in,17,lbabdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbabdb/mgni_why_it_is_still_a_great_time_to_buy_in/,21,1612338908.0,"  

**TL/DR at the bottom**

I do not see nearly enough love for MGNI on r/stocks or WSB so I want to give you all a look in at a one-way ticket to gains.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.",2021-02-03 09:55:08

I'm ngl, it freaked me the fuck out like some sort of anti-moon tardo.  I totally fell for the FUD as my beloved rocket stonk continues to swan dive into my wife's boyfriends bunghole.

So onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:

1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.
2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.
3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.
4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.
5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.

&#x200B;

My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.

This isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.  

This isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is buying tickets to the squeeze show.  Tickets just went on discount.  Anyone bailing is a smoothed brained pheasant.  Fuck you, fight me in the Wendy's. I am an alpha ape with a big pp. \*spams emojis\*",2021-02-03 09:55:03

What is going on with $GME’s Stats??? 🚀✨,216,lba42r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lba42r/what_is_going_on_with_gmes_stats/,95,1612338301.0,"Currently holding 25 Shares of GME at about $104 average price. Today shook me, not gonna lie, as a college student it's scary to lose thousands of $$$ in minutes but these hands are diamond!! 🙌🏻💎

Anyway, what is confusing me about all this is the statistics, maybe its because I'm a retarded tendie loving idiot, so maybe someone could explain to me what I'm seeing.

On Yahoo Finance, It says that the percentage of shares owned by insiders is 27.33% and the percentage of shares held by institutions is 122.04%. How can there be more than 100% of a company? & that's not even including retail investors (or maybe it does, again, I'm retarded) 
Okay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? 🤔🤔🤔

Also, the short percentage of the float is 226.42% for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%. 

So i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 “Best Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now” from Nasdaq.com 📈

just look at the stats: 

AMC 🎞

Shares Outstanding: 287.28M
% Held By Insiders: 2.30%
% Held by Institutions: 37.24% 
Shares Short: 44.67M
Short % of Float: 38.12%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 20.67%

GME 🎮

Shares Outstanding: 69.75M
% Held By Insiders: 27.33%
% Held by Institutions: 122.04%
Shares Short: 61.78M 
Short % of Float: 226.42%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 88.58%

BBBY 🧴

Shares Outstanding: 121.22M
% Held By Insiders: 5.76%
% Held by Institutions: 117.88%
Shares Short: 74.89M
Short % of Float: 82.41%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 61.78%

SPCE 🚀

Shares Outstanding: 234.34M
% Held By Insiders: 40%
% Held by Institutions: 29.72%
Shares Short: 38.6M 
Short % of Float: 56.15%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 16.47%

FUBO 📺

Shares Outstanding: 108.85M
% Held By Insiders: 17.38%
% Held by Institutions: 7.24%
Shares Short: 39.17M
Short % of Float: 72.74%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 57.98%

As you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding. 

So, 
AMC has 15.5% of it’s total shares shorted
BBBY has 61.7% of its total shares shorted
FUBO has 35.98% of its total shares shorted
SPCE has 16.47% of its total shares shorted

But GME has 88.57% of it’s shares shorted!?!?!?!?

Look, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange. 

Is there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it’s stats are like that? 🙌🏻💎",2021-02-03 09:45:01

\-Short interest as of 2/2 is growing.  [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) 16 Milllion shorted today and a massive Short ratio, and I don't see them covering any time soon.

We gained 6 million people in a month.  If even 1 million of them each bought 1 share, and held.  At 100$ a share, that's alot of money and shares.  IDK math.  (100 Million dollars?).  It helps anyway.  This will ramp up, and just as we had some random paper hands on the way down, they will have paper hands on the way up.

\-We just got a whole bunch more people, at a whole lot cheaper price.  Sure, we have alot of people at 300 and 350, but we have ALOT of people.  Getting all these new people able to reload at 100$ a share is a godsend.  I doubled my shares on the way down, and will probably buy more as money clears.  Diamond hands are the way to go.  IF you are scared, don't want a loss, etc etc. It is literally so simple.  Buy, put in the highest sell order the brokerage will let you, and don't worry about it other than to buy more.  8 MILLION people even with 1000$ each, COULD LITERALLY BUY  GAMESTOP AT ITS CURRENT PRICE.  We already have an edge with people like DFV having .5% of gamestop.  I don't know what his plan is, but if it keeps dropping, and he decides to buy more, or exercise those options, that position will only grow. We have several millionaires in here as well buying and holding.  So, if you have 1-2 shares, they will help make up for it.

Bear Case:

\-Honestly, the only way we lose this is if you sell, or people lose confidence. Have a plan, don't doubt, stick to it, chin up, buy more, live life in the mean time.",2021-02-03 09:42:09

**We’re heard all sorts of talk, many but not all being bots:**

- “The shorts have covered, it’s over”

- “I cashed out but sadly it was during last weeks premarket at 510 and not 515, you guys are retarded and should sell.”

- “I burned my house down for the insurance money and put it into GME along with my life savings at $450 and now I’m long rope.”

- “I sucked 185 dicks for 185 bucks and got 1 GME share today but then I sold because this is taking too long.”

**So to ease your minds I’ve taken the time to post [This Poll](https://strawpoll.com/crzhh7f7b/r) on WSB and found the median amount of shares owned by the average WSB user**

The data set ranges are a bit wide but for a median it works just fine and may actually be a bit of an underestimation. 

So, the number of shares the average WSB user owns? **8.** That may not seem like much but let’s just check out the number of new WSB users in recent times.

I checked [subreddit stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/Wallstreetbets) and saw that on Jan 23rd, we had about **2M** Redditors on WSB, today that number is over **8M**.

Now let’s be VERY generous and say 30% of the total number of users are actually bots, 10% lurkers, 10% with 0 shares.

Well then that means **4M X 8 Shares = 32M Shares**

🦍 🦍 🦍 **is in control of over 50% of the available shares.**

And let me make it just a bit more interesting...

**If those 4M holders theoretically bought 4 more shares each, we would own the available float on GameStop, and we could literally set our price with no room to fuck around. We would effectively own GameStop.**

**TL;DR: The average WSB user owns 8 shares, some math shows that’s about 32M shares out of about 47M Float**

BUY MORE SHARES, LETS FUCK THE INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE FUCKED YOU OVER AS LONG AS YOU’VE BEEN ALIVE.

A message to the old guard,93,lb9sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb9sub/a_message_to_the_old_guard/,58,1612337377.0,"To those whose home has been invaded, I thank you. I am upset, somewhat sullen, and slightly bitter, but still owe you thanks.

I had some prior investment experience. Nothing too serious. I'm a frugal person who saves a lot. I've passively invested--in the most elementary of ways through a few stocks, Roths and IFs--but never took the dive to properly understand the market, its mechanisms, and its movements.

Over the past few weeks, I've gained some insights on these. But I have come to the full realization of just how little I knew. I've attempted to grasp too much too quickly, and had left myself holding a bag. I fell victim to the hype and prospect of gaining a stronger economic footprint amongst a pandemic-driven job market, and have lost about 15% of my net worth. Thankfully, I gambled money that wasn't necessary for bills or debts. Most of my emergency fund is gone, but that will come back soon enough.

What will remain is the cemented, constant caution of DD. The understanding that a core community, whitewashed by popularity, can generate momentum in which they aren't heeded. The reiteration that financial success in these markets is not one of kindness, altruism, or hand-holding.

For all the gaslighting, satire, and lulz, I hate you. But I also understand; you cannot continue to preach the truth when fanaticism dominates the discussion. I've been on the internet long enough to expect nothing less.

Thank you for creating this space. I will take my losses. I will **lurk**, **listen,** and **learn.**

Gather around the fire place and let me tell you a story I once read upon the great great internet. It was about the Great Squeeze of 2021. In the cold nights of January when hedge funds of dubious morale had their asses handed to them by a bunch of apes with bananas and lust for a stonks. Dirty tricks were played by brokers and other establishments of Wall Street as they waged an ongoing struggle against the common man. This story starts as the struggle seemed lost for our brave apes with bananas.......

GameStop is falling. Whether the hedge funds covering is legal or not doesn’t matter. If it’s done illegally, they’ll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.

Robinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that’s it. They might get a slap on the wrist, maybe some will have to remove certain features, but that’s it.

There won’t be a great retribution. There probably won’t be “justice”. Sometimes you just lose money. This is the danger of fomo and looking at the market as a get rich quick scheme. MOST people lose when they do this, only a few win, and usually you have to be in early enough to win anything substantial.

Sometimes being a retard pays off, but most of the time you just lose. There is almost never some some great conspiracy theory. Almost always it’s just an L.

GameStop ran up over 1000% in a month. It’s very likely we’ve already experienced the short squeeze. 

AMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.

There is a ton of money to be made with our collective minds, but spending your energy justifying GameStop is not the way to make that money. If you genuinely think that the short sellers are not currently covering their positions at the prices over the past 2 days then you’re delusional. Take your emotions out of the market and you’ll make a lot more money.

You were suddenly seeing more green in your portfolios than many of you could have ever hoped for and you were hitting the 🌈🐻 where it hurts, their pocketbook. 

Where you went wrong was taking that small victory and doing full blown retarded things to celebrate. Things like flying banners over robinhood, buying billboards, and just generally taking focus away from your goals and the path to them. You’ve poked the bear and now the bear has swiped back. 

Instead of going full retard, which Robert Downey Jr says you should never do, take these moments away from the market to self-improve. Learn to read, research financial topics, evaluate your past plays and the emotions involved, just do more than screeching at the hedge funds for such a small victory. Think about how you, the individual investor, can continue hitting the shorts and start showing the red on their balance sheets again.

Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS),8565,lb9j2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb9j2l/why_gme_is_still_in_the_game_to_trigger_moass/,933,1612336592.0,"Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

**Harley Davidson DD- WILD HOGS🐖🚀🐖🚀**

WHO IS READY TO GO HOG WILD! Harley announced earnings and got spanked- no worries… we will go the moon.

If intellectually disabled (🐒) look at the TL;DR

**BULLISH SENTIMENT:**

Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.

· he became CEO of Puma – making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time – and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands

· he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.

His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.

Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.

**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**

Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.

**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**

the chart shows 3 price gaps up and a large island formation, a correction is inevitable as the value is overestimated. That pattern and earnings should force this into decline.

Like many others I would imagine, I am done with Robinhood. I wasn't even in GME, but I cannot in good conscious support a company that distorts the free market. Yesterday, when the restriction was 1 GME share, I bought at $246 out of spite. Limit set at $10k if they want it back (so they can't loan out the share). Fuck em.

I have been exiting all my positions yesterday and today and have been transferring the funds to TD Ameritade because I like the Think Or Swim platform.

https://valueofgrowth.com/recent-posts/f/the-3-best-stocks-to-watch-in-2021-with-huge-upside?blogcategory=stocks

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. 

**Positions**
Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

Corsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   


**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire & their Q3 report.**

Net revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.

Operating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.

Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.

Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.

As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.

The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.

u/thechosenguy1 said ""These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad?

**You didn't do your research:** GME (and to a lesser extent NOK/BBBY/BB) has been a work-in-progress for months.  This wasn't something organic and spontaneous; there was a very small window to catch the lightning.  Once in, you took the advice from random internet strangers who want you to buy/hold to increase the value of their positions.

**You FOMO'd:** If you knew about this before $100 and didn't jump, you probably should've sat it out.  If you found out about this after $100, you should have watched from the sidelines and taken notes for the next time.

**You didn't have a plan:** Sure, your spaceship emojis are cute but they're free and you can't buy anything with them in the real world.  If you're buying stocks, you're doing so with the intent to make money.  Money is only real when you sell.  Set a goal, stick to it (or make small adjustments; it's ok to change a goal as long as it's REASONABLE).  This includes taking profits and then, if you want, buying back in on a dip.

**You made it personal:** Stocks aren't your pets; they're fucking cattle.  Get what you can out of them and then move on.  You don't buy stocks to join a feel-good movement about sticking it to the <insert target group here> or because ""I like to company/stock"", you buy them to make money. 

**You made it a group activity:** Unless you're pooling resources and winnings, all these ""Ape"" comments are fucking retarded.  That's code for, ""please don't leave me I don't want to be the last one holding bags""

**You missed the obvious signs:** WSB goes dark and all the meme stocks collapse a the same time, that's a sign.  All of the meme stocks move in-sync, that's a sign (algos are in charge, not retail investors).

**You used money you couldn't lose:** This ties into the group mentality and DD where you just hopped on the bus without asking where it was going or how; NEVER spend money you can't afford to lose in the stock market -- there are no sure bets.

100% this will get removed by all the fucking idiots in this sub so do yourself a solid and copy/paste it for reference; hopefully it'll add value to your future endeavors.

WARNING FOR ALL THOSE LOOKING TO JUMP FROM RH TO FIDELITY **READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR MOVE**,1,lb8qyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8qyg/warning_for_all_those_looking_to_jump_from_rh_to/,0,1612334420.0,"Hi there fellow autists. After the bullshit that Robinhood pulled last week I, and many others on this sub, decided to jump ship for another brokerage. I read the fine print as I hope at least some of you did. I understood my stocks would be in limbo and I would be shit out of luck for about a week. What I did not know was that Robinhood's ""instant deposit"" or w/e they call it basically turns your account into a margin account. So when my stocks made it over to Fidelity everything showed up as being on margin. There was a sweet $2k deficit on there as well. That deficit was the result of an unsettled deposit to RH from a few days prior to my initiating the account transfer. Just fucking wonderful. After being on the line for over two hours with Fidelity's customer service to find out what the actual fuck is happening with my stocks they explained that because there was a deficit and the stocks were on margin they would be rejecting the transfer and sending everything back over to Robinhood.

So what's the takeaway here? Make fucking sure any deposits, purchases or otherwise are SETTLED before transferring over your account. Else you will be in the same boat and stuck back at Robinhood.

Be safe out there retards.

"Data-Driven DD: I analyzed 265,000 rows of SEC Short Fails-to-Deliver data so you don't have to! (Extremely important data for Counterfeit Stock theories)",8348,lb8hjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/,522,1612333790.0,"# The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either — if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure — when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream — GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

&#x200B;

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&#x200B;

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

&#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

Snake then leave tall grass and say loudly, ""Banana only worth $10 now, you sssaw us buy and sssell it for $10. It could go down to $3 sssoon! We will pay $10 for all your banana!""

Copied from Tradesmith. Author: Justice Clark Litle.
I removed some words to prevent auto mod

Over the past few days, the level of hedge fund short interest in GameStop fell sharply. Or did it?

On the evening of Monday, Feb. 1, Bloomberg reported that “GameStop Short Interest Plunges in Sign Traders Are Covering.”

Two separate research firms, IHS Markit and S3 Partners, reported the drop:

“Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop’s short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.”

The reporting coincided with a big drop in the value of GME shares. This is clear evidence that the hedge funds are winning, and that the Reddit army is losing.

Unless the short interest data is being manipulated, which is also a real possibility.

If the U.S. Congress does any real digging when it holds hearings on the GameStop situation, it will uncover some very interesting quirks of the market, many of them revolving around shorting practices.

Most people understand “naked shorting” to be an illegal thing, and it is — sort of.

On the other hand, there are plenty of instances where naked shorting is more of a gray area — not so much a violation of the law as a minor infraction worthy of a parking ticket — and other instances where certain players can short a stock beyond 100% of the float, or short nakedly, in a wholly legal way.

This is where the reported sharp decline in GameStop (GME) short interest gets intriguing.

There are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining — giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts — even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.

The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.

If a critical mass of holders on the long side of GME started selling to realize profit in GME, that would have given the hedge funds an opportunity to cover their shorts — via buying back their shares — at progressively lower levels as the share price fell.

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out.

The notion that the squeezers broke ranks, and that the hedge funds are winning, is certainly the perception that was created. The Bloomberg article strongly suggested that the Reddit army has lost.

“Short squeezes can only last as long as there is a large short position in a stock,” the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. told Bloomberg. “Once that dissipates, the situation changes completely.”

But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate.

If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.

That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions. 

In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short — with tens of billions of dollars on the line — could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.

The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can read it here via the SEC website.

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.
It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.”

In plain language, “Trader A” in SEC parlance could intentionally be giving the appearance of closing their illegal short position — when in reality they have no intention of doing so (or no ability to do so).

Under normal circumstances, tricks like these were used to help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located.

The GameStop squeeze is a unique scenario, however, because it is a very public fight to the finish between the Reddit army and the hedge funds that are short. Either the Reddit army wins and the hedge funds pay four-digit prices ($1,000 or more) to cover their shorts because of margin calls, or the hedge funds win and the GME share price falls back to the low double-digits.

In a battle like that, with public coverage influencing both sides, perception is a weapon. As such, if the hedge funds can generate the appearance of having covered most of their shorts, while driving down the GME share price through aggressive selling on low volume (something known as a “short ladder attack”), then the hedge funds increase their odds of breaking the squeeze — in part because media outlets will report things like “GameStop Short Interest Plunges” without looking deeper.

To be clear, it is also possible the first scenario is true.

GameStop shares may have fallen precipitously, with hedge fund short interest falling alongside, because a critical mass of long GME holders simply lost faith and tried to sell before the squeeze was complete. 

But it makes a lot of sense to question that narrative, given the wide array of deceptive tricks that some hedge funds (certainly not all of them, or even most of them) have used to perpetuate questionable or even illegal shorting tactics for a very long time.

And again, these tricks are so pervasive and old, the SEC wrote a “risk alert” memo about them in 2013.

As such, whether the drop in GameStop short interest was real or smoke and mirrors, the fact that changes in the level of short interest can be faked — with hedge funds making it look like they have closed out, but haven’t — is a serious compliance loophole that should be forcefully addressed.

As a side note, the answer to this problem likely resides in the (removed)

Apart from market maker privileges, the three big reasons hedge funds can play games with short positions — delayed reporting requirements, time windows of days (or even weeks in some cases) for trades to settle, and related transactions being executed in different places, or with different counterparties, for the sake of deception — could all be answered with a (removed)-based settling and clearing system where transactions are noted instantly and made visible to all parties (plus the SEC).",2021-02-03 23:43:03
VIAC AND MSOS MY PICKS FOR THE YEAR,21,lbnr1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbnr1x/viac_and_msos_my_picks_for_the_year/,8,1612388532.0,"VIAC and MSOS my picks of the year

Two fantastic picks to look at for February and 2021 
VIAC and MSOS details on calls below. Positions listed below but I have calls and equity on both 2-26 3-19 calls 45-60 on VIAC and 2-19 calls 42-50 MSOS  see details below. 

ViacomCBS investor day will price the stock far above current valuations based on Pluto Tv Paramount plus and showtime. This will be one of the most significant Investor events in 2021 on pair with the Disney investor event in December. The VIAC trade is based in many factors including the growth of free streaming globally and production capacity. Look at the trends coming from Netflix and Amazon who both look at Viac for content production capacity. Pluto TV just signed a major content deal with Netflix for narcos I expect to see more from this as NFLX chase towards profits. Before discounting VIAC look at Pluto Tv. 

Next we have my favorite US pure cannabis ETF which focuses on the big four stocks and sold off big Today. This will print money an 🚀🚀🚀 after the second week in February when the cannabis stocks all beat earnings. More people
Smoked weed in the last month of 2020 than any month before. Facts. This will translate to the ETF across the board and I alread the took advantage today and bought the equity and the calls see below. 


Long VIAC calls around 2-24 because of the investor day. 
Long the equity and the calls. Strike dates 2-26 3-5 3-19 strike prices 50, 55 ,60 coverage all over both dates and prices for near maximum upside. 

US pure cannabis ETF is one of the best plays around with the industry set to explode over the next 5 years and legalization in the next 2 years 
 
Also long MSOS calls and equity because of the big surge in cannabis demand and how it translates to the stocks. 2-19 calls for MSOS 44 45 46 47 48 49 50

WHAT CHANGED SINCE FRIDAY HERE AND WHAT NOT I AM ASKING MYSELF. SO LETS COUNT BANANAS:

I checked daily the [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

&#x200B;

On Friday (market closed) we had: 

SHORT INTEREST    68,13M 

SHARES SHORT       97,685%

DAY TO COVER         6,31

Right now  February 3, 2021 we have the following data:

SHORT INTEREST    61,78M <-----------  DOWN 6,35M

SHARES SHORT       88,58% <------------  DOWN 9,105%

DAY TO COVER         2,81     <------------  DOWN 3,5 Days

You may now say that the values haven't changed that much, or in a reasonable way and still GME is rank #1 worldwide for the most amount of %Share Shorts AND still have 2,81 Days to cover the shorts.

BUT I FEEL A LOT OF APES ARE TELLING THIS THING IS OVER AND THE SQUEEZE ALREADY HAPPENED. NOTHING MORE. BYE FOLKS? LETS GO BACK TO NFLIX?!

You want to tell me those hedgies will delete all their positions without buying back and we have a boring tearful week without anything really happening to the price anymore?

There's 330 million people in the us, maybe less now because of Covid.

And the reason is simple: a huge buttfuckton of the students, the people, have shitty internet access, no internet access, or live in some feudal comcast net neutrality repealed fucknut kingdom.

A real quick search of one group I'm in shows that for one district in michigan, they have 50% of the student body without ANY internet access. Yeah, digital age coming along for those people.

Why do you people keep raving about the digital age when so many people don't have an internet connection strong enough to download an IOS update in less than 5 hours, let alone a COD update.

Those people aren't living in big cities, but rural centres. Still, their internet is almost as good as mine, in Australia.

Most of the people here -have- privileged internet access. But I bet my fucking balls there's more than a few people here who have average, or poor internet. Some issue with their biller.

What does't cost internet? Physical shit. And in a place like the US where I'm sure there are people in lower SES communities afraid of doing a craigslist buy for a secondhand disk because they might get robbed, fleeced or shot, there's a huge market for a middleman who at least won't disappear of craigslist after you find out the game is scratched or broken.

That also doesn't include how a huge proportion of gamers are now women, and who don't have the male privilege of not viewing everything as a potential attack, especially given the virality of #metoo in the last 10 years.

More than a few people have boasted about using funds gained to buy things they need, or to donate things like a switch or ten to a hospital. Because we all know that when life really fucking sucks if you've got a video game you can play then you are able to at least escape, just for a bit. I'm gonna play super metroid after this.

What does all of this spell? It spells that half the reason that people are betting against gamestop is because a bunch of old people, due to their own privilege and inability to understand the social economics of why and how people play video games, have failed to understand that regardless of gamestop's need to pivot to the lucrative metropolitan market, that until there is ubiquitous internet access for ALL americans, Gamestop has a VALUABLE place in the market as a safe place for pixel purveyors to do business.

As the reply to the reply, yes amazon is a big online retailer and makes big money because people who like convenience also shop there. True. But also good luck returning what you bought from amazon, and good luck selling shit on there, it's not ebay, and inaccessible for the average punter.

In sum of my short, poorly referenced sociology post,

FUCKING BUY GME and HOLD IT LIKE ITS YOUR LAST WANK BEFORE NO NUT NOVEMBER

This is also not financial or legal advice. This is just logic.

Look at the Pluto TV acquisition from VIAC and you see the winner winner chicken dinner, WS is betting on the wrong streaming play with Netflix, look at the future of streaming and subscription fatigue. Pluto TV is the cure. There has been a lot of press and DD but no one is paying attention, investor day is 23 days away. After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I don’t think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. 

from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. 

But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see  that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit. 

If you missed the point don’t feel bad your like most of Wall Street today. VIAC is value in plain sight and it’s a growth stock in a hyper growth sector. We won’t see another streaming opportunity like this. After investor day on 2-24 the world will realize what has been silently growing for years. This is a huge opportunity and I’ve posted my positions before but I will again.

GME: Check....mate?,329,lbmum3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbmum3/gme_checkmate/,94,1612385469.0,"Theory: What if we, WSB/retail, push the issue and call our brokerages to demand copies of our share certificates? It's a bit old school and there may be fees involved, but if we can demand proof of ownership of our shares, or proof that brokerages cannot provide proof of ownership, wouldn't that place the onus on the people who oversold the stock?

There may be fees involved to submit the request for stock certificates, but the upfront cost of authenticity may be worth the potential gains of exposing counterfeit shares and having a legal leg to stand on forcing a buyback from the institutions that ~~oversold short and~~ are failing to deliver. Triggering the greatest squeeze the world has seen.

**Please proof my logic:**

Shares were sold/issued by GME to investors/institutions.

Institutions took those shares and placed bets against them.

Other institutions took those bets and resold them to other firms.

Other firms traded those bets all the way down to the retailer.

I want proof that the share I own is a legitimate GME backed share.

I go to the broker and say, show me where my shares came from.

The broker says, here are your stock certificate ID's.

If the hypothesis that retail owns more of the available float is true, then brokers will be unable to provide CUSID's on the shares issued. 

They will have to go back to who they bought the shares from and say, ""I need to see ownership of these shares.""

The institution they purchased the shares from will have to provide proof, ""These are the shares we sold you."" 

This traceability should be able to go all the way back to GME for verification, but if someone somewhere along the way produced counterfeit shares, this will identify who the culprit is. Then we have a fighting chance.

The past few day have been rough for many of us. I can only remotely imagine how some of you feel, that literally have put their life savings into our holy grail. Those are the days, when conviction is shrinking, the shills are turning against us and the portfolio is going tits up. 
I am very grateful for the people here that spend a lot of time posting their dd on the current option and short interest situation. You are giving people faith in times when our Ape-hairs are turning gray or just fall out. However, I feel urged to remind you of your situation:
- can you cope with your entire position going tits up (🌈🐻 - case basically but needs to be taken into account)
- if you have a major position in $GME, do you have a clear case for what is supposed to come?
- Does your dd rely on objective data-sets or rather emotional bias? We are all prone to confirmation bias. Thats why I browse the sub so frequently

One final take: try to avoid margin as it restricts your freedom and might force you to 🧻👐 at the worst situation due to a margin call. If you are in it with your life savings you dont have to double down with money you dont own. Otherwise you might as well sell your kidney...

Here is Why:

The GameStop Short/Gamma Squeeze worked because we had 3 things on our side

1. Surprise: We were underestimated in the capital we could bring to the table
2. Focus: A huge focus of our readers was on a single Stonk
3. Momentum: Fast growing crowd and upswing.

However in the past few days we lost all 3.

1. Surprise: The surprise was clearly gone, the second the news started reporting on us. This is theoretically ok as losing the element of surprise could be replaced by an increase in both focus and momentum. This was especially important because of the volume of short interest initially.
2. Focus: Our bets went from a laser focus on a $200m GME to a spread out focus into AMC, NOK, Etc. This was when we needed the focus the most, as GME's market cap rose over $20 Billion
3. Momentum: This was literally stopped dead in its tracks the second that the brokerages pulled our ability to purchase more shares. This is not something that we could have expected, it was a fundamental shift in the rules of the game, but it happened.

This is not to say GME won't or can't go to the moon, this is to say that in order for GME to move forward there would need to be a different set of elements that would need to come together.

You are welcome to hate on the post, disagree with my logic or just not agree with I am saying. But, for this and future plays I think it is important for people to be thoughtful of what caused the run up and where we are today.

I'm not saying to buy or sell GME, but this is where I believe things stand.",2021-02-03 22:41:16

$SCHW just release its daily average trade summary for January 2021.

It has seen daily average trade growth from 5.13 million in October all the way to 10.3million by the end of January.

This number will continue to increase as retail investors growth continues to boom and upset traders on Etoro, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive broker flee to Vangaurd/Fidelity/TD/Schwab the few companies who didn't restrict trading.

https://preview.redd.it/t9vbj0ina9f61.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc9dc2b2fe100127e9cd2faa618c693db3a8bd03

**Revenue Sensitivity (daily average trades)**

Taken directly from their winter business update which was released online yesterday.

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_2021\_winter\_business\_update\_020221.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf)

Calculating revenue growth just on the daily average trades we can see that they will be experience increased revenues this quarter of:

10,326 - 6,543 (average daily trades for all last quarter) = 3,782/ 100 \* 60M = 2.2 Billion increase in revenues just as a result of increased daily trades. This is assuming the 10,326 daily trades stays flat for the rest of the quarter. I expect the daily trades to continue to rise as a result of increased retailer activity and market trend. Lets say 2.5 Billion increase as a result of retail investor growth.

To put this in perspective they reported 4.1 Billion in revenue in Q4 last quarter. If they are to report 6.5 Billion plus this stock will jump 30%+ next earnings. Combined with cost savings with the TD merger Net income will see a increase of over 50% from last quarter sending this to $80-100 after next earnings report.

**Margin Balances:**

Schwab had to restrict the use of margin balances on select stocks during the January boom as retail investors started to opt to use margin to increase their holdings and risk. Margin usage has seen a drastic increase per their Q4 statements and I expect Q1 to follow suit with continued growth.

**Part 1 DD Summary:**

**Average Daily users:** 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

Etoro, Webull and RH will be facing lawsuites and scrutiny as a result of their trade restrictions. Do you want your money sitting in a brokerage with possible liquidly issues as a result of lawsuites.

**Balance Sheet Strength:**

Schwab has the strongest balance sheet of any brokerage on the market. With Trillions of dollars under management. This means that they will not need to restrict purchasing power of shares when there are substantial new deposits.

**Quote directly from Mark Cuban's AMA:**

When you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts and wont blink an eye.

**GME and AMC Round 2**

For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.

**Monthly Activity Report**

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth.

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys 🚀,328,lbma8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbma8f/gme_brief_recap_why_did_you_buy_gme_in_the_first/,80,1612383309.0,"TLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.

I am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.

**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**

I think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.

You know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. 

Note: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.

**Microsoft revenue sharing**

GME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?

**PC building kiosk**

Know microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:

\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently

\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get 🚀. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.

\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.

**Conclusion**

GME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.

Position GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth. 

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

Calls are cheap.

All I can say is that in the past days they've been trying to do EVERYTHING they could in order to make you sell, and it wouldn't surprise me if they'd try to do build up your hopes to then crush them down just like they did to $GME in the last week.

One good thing to do if you decided to HOLD: for every post saying ""tomorrow is the big day"" expect to hold at least one day more. 

Set your upwards stock variation notifications to an higher value than actual $GME price, and take some time to relax.

They want you to feel stressed, they want you to shit your pants, and now is the time to believe in what you thought when you decided to buy. 

You should have known they weren't going to go down so easily. 
This is exactly the part where they're proving that: they're powerful, very powerful, and no weak ass 🙌🧻 bitches will ever hurt them in any way.

In the moment you bought, you decided to fight. Now it's the part where you have to do the fighting.

If you can't afford to lose this fight, you should use your brain and take a decision, if you really believe in your past week's plans, then what happened in the last few days probably shouldn't really mean anything to you.

Don't forget many of us are not here just to make money,
we're here to change a rigged game, and if you thought clicking a few buttons on your phone would have been enough to win, you were obviously wrong.

It is in our possible losses the hope to build a better future for who's to come. Change comes with a sacrifice.

Those who stand by those beliefs will never lose.

I really am not a financial advisor nor a financial expert, I'm barely an enthusiast. I'm retarded for sure.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best. 
Yours, Jordan. 

P.S I really appreciate that your email address is on your article because even if I don't get a reply it makes you seem very easy to contact... A feature not shared with a lot of journalists. So thank you!

Robinhood's imposed buy limits coincide perfectly with $GME's stock plummeting.

If the demand for stock is: buying it > selling it, it rises.

If it's selling it > buying it, it plummets. And $GME is plummeting because of Robinhood's buying restrictions.

The only hurdle right now is Robinhood's decision to limit $GME share purchases. But everyone is either against or on that case ([Sherrod Brown](https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1354881250922819585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354881250922819585%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Ted Cruz](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354833603943931905%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [Attorney General James](https://twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN/status/1354914072194592776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354914072194592776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Faoc-and-lawmakers-call-for-hearings-on-robinhood-for-freezing-trades-on-gamestop-stock%2F), [AOC](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1354830697459032066), [Elon Musk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/01/elon-musk-robinhood-clubhouse-gamestop/)).

As long as you don't sell your shares, the sky-fucking-high demand for $GME right NOW is gonna skyrocket its prices—it's garnering worldwide attention.

So hold, even if it's one share. 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Edit (Feb 4, 15:19 GMT) : The logic definitely is over simplified, but I wanted to be short and to the point. Couching my point with a bunch of esoteric financial terms is only gonna obscure what I'm trying to say. Robinhood definitely isn't the only reason the share prices are plummeting. I may have come off that way. I acknowledge that plenty of other brokers have placed purchase restrictions as well. I only  mention Robinhood because they're arguably the biggest source of demand for $GME.",2021-02-03 21:35:03

As people dislike this discrimination there is already an angry shitstorm on social media in Germany. Many who have kept their concert tickets to wait for an alternative date are now returning them out of indignation and want to boycott the company in the future.

Maybe there is a possibility to earn money through actions on the stock exchange due to this fact and on the other hand to harm the company to the maximum.

Definitely a good opportunity to ""short"" the shares if you have the chance.

With this @GME, I thought that maybe it was time to try and ‘play’ with the stock market, so I dug up $100 bucks I had laying around and bought some fractional shares at @418.

I’m down 70%ish but my mind could not have been better. I literally don’t care if I lose this money as that was my mentality going into this.

Like the rest of you retarded apes, I’m holding forever.

The TA is best inverted, while the shitposts like ""my friend who is UPS delivery driver says it is the busiest it has ever been so I'm YOLOing into calls for earnings"" somehow print.

Yes, there are a plenty of autists here pretending to be retards, but most are retards pretending to be autists and their bravery to YOLO away their student loans sustains erections worldwide from the glorious loss porn, and they are honored for their sacrifice.

Adding $BBBY under $30 per share to your Short Squeeze Arsenal is a crazy smart play right now.,12,lbl8k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbl8k0/adding_bbby_under_30_per_share_to_your_short/,30,1612379060.0,"My Ape brain went in for 37 shares of $BBBY (Bed Bath & Beyond) last Wednesday at $38 a share (along with 12 $AMCs at $16 & 1.45 $GMEs at $324 [HOLDING]) And today I went to dump the $BBBY shares, but after looking into it, $BBBY under $30 is the best bet for a short squeeze play on the market right now, because even if the squeeze doesn’t happen, the stock will gain value.

Reading this you will learn: 
1. $BBBY has a constant uptrend 
2. $BBBY has staying power 
3. $BBBY’s uptrend will continue through the Summer and possibly Fall 
4. $BBBY stock will not only give you a Short Squeeze opportunity, But is has long value of 10% in 6 months over its current price



AT ITS CURRENT PRICE $BBBY HAS LONG TREND VALUE (EVEN AT 6 MONTHS). During this Cycle (which I’m starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line: https://imgur.com/dhbfPzw


$BBBY is a healthy company, but so called ‘smart money’ thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call “Nesting.” which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. We’re not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the “Nesting” trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY. So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at: https://imgur.com/ml6swYO


NOW HERE’S THE BEST PART: Most Apes on here who pay attention know that this stock is shorted by 65%. Here’s a list if you’re new: https://imgur.com/Nm4hsxQ


Of all the companies on this list, $BBBY is the only one with a very healthy trend line compared to it’s current stock price. Even at a stock price between $25-$30, which is above $BBBY’s current ‘Higher-Low’ trend line, in 5 months $BBBY will be worth $33. There is still a 10% growth there. A LOT OF RETAIL AND INSTUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE HIP TO THIS, AND THEY LIKE THE STOCK, SO THEY ARE HOLDING!


If another GME Sort-Squeeze is going to go KABOOM on another stock, its probably going to happen to $BBBY and soon. The last settlement date for shorts was on Friday with 51 Million shares, but have 11 days to cover. The Next settlement date, Monday, February 14th, 62.5 million shares have only 5 days to cover. On February 28th, 64 million shares will need to be settled with only 5 days to cover. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bbby/short-interest


If $BBBY is a healthy stock that has a current price under $30 and a long price of $33 for July 2021 (10%+ its current value), it’s being shorted at 62%, retail and intuitional investors are holding, and 126million+ shares are going to have to be settled by the end of February….


Here’s my observations on why Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY stock is going to be healthy for a long time. I call them the “Doubles”:


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES IN 2021! “Hedge Fund” belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but there’s going to be long ramp up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and campaign parties (these are actually pretty fun. I don’t drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc… are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath & Beyond sells party supplies? I’m not talking about just paper plates and napkins; I’m talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over… all the stuff someone would want for a party.
People don’t have time to wait for an online order to show up when they’re preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIEND’S HOMES! Long distance family and friends haven’t seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family “Back Home” or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; they’re going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS! All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH & BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them.
Here’s a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 & 2022 because people like links in these DDs: https://www.insider.com/weddings-will-be-more-expensive-after-pandemic-2022-2021-1


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS! A ton of new college kids didn’t move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys, lamps, etc… And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH & BEYOND


WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER –ITS NOW HERE TO STAY! And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: “You know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now.” Or, “Remember how so and so’s dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.” When squirrely hits, you aren’t going to wait around for an online delivery, you’re going to go get it NOW.


 $BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling. Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. Bed Bath & Beyond is already reported to have a good quarterly report coming next week, plus all the variables I laid out are going to continue the company’s positive earnings for the year.


Oh yea, some Key company factors: 
1. As per their last report they got $2.2 billion in the bank. They’re Liquid 
2. 15 million have downloaded their store app 
3. 2.2 million new online customers last year 
4. Other important financials that IDK what they’re about

Why you should hold. Opportunity still exists. *Long read 10 Min* Realistic outlook.,618,lbkzob,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbkzob/why_you_should_hold_opportunity_still_exists_long/,118,1612378015.0,"*Im holding shares of GME at a average price of $56, my view may be biased but I tried to look at all evidence and not be.*

I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have what’s best. Don’t listen to random people online.

However I’m going to let you know why I’m still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who haven’t sold yet and aren’t planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares (*200+*) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didn’t have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities (*$124 to $300 for example*) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF aren’t out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding. 

*So what’s the game plan?*

Well firstly I think the HF couldn’t have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying (*people normally not involved in stocks*) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers (*decrease buying pressure*) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI (*2 weeks ago date*) and I’m assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they won’t fold (*some can’t sell*). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100. 

Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved (*retail got bored/lost too much money and isn’t financially involved with GME*) there will be less competition to buy shares. They don’t want the whole world’s eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at there’s prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone who’s shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they (*shorts*) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.

TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldn’t want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind. 

Here’s some emojis for you retarded apes 🦧🦍🚀🪐",2021-02-03 20:46:55
DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?,158,lbkyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbkyne/dd_why_gme_valuation_is_valid_at_300/,44,1612377886.0,"The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

Why invest in Vaxart Inc. (VXRT),14,lbksik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbksik/why_invest_in_vaxart_inc_vxrt/,46,1612377111.0,"I expect today Phase 1 results before Vaxart speaks in the early afternoon (ET).

The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !

And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (e.g neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)

Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.

Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.

It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.

I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.

It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.

In any case if we do not get news Premarket - this would be indicative that something very big goes on behind the scene. But zero doubt that the phase 1 data would disappoint. Keep this stock, it may change the fate of this pandemic but also your financial being",2021-02-03 20:31:51

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

THE DIRECTION OF THIS RALLY,134,lbkbqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbkbqq/the_direction_of_this_rally/,33,1612375119.0,"Where is the direction of our rally going?

Listen up, it's late as hell and I want to get this off my mind. 

There's been many comments and posts saying to get off this journey before you loose too much. Yes, I agree - get out if you're on the verge of eviction and need to pay your fucking rent to survive. 

But we're drifting off a clear direction. Yes, we're all looking to profit and take some tendies home. But the fact that DFV didn't sell everything proves that the direction of this movement has changed. It's not all about profits anymore. It's about exposing the game we're playing and the rules set. 

Sure we can play the same game for years and follow advice from r/stocks or r/investing and take our 10% yearly profits. But this isn't what this fucking sub was about. 

!!THIS SUB HAS NEVER BEEN A SOURCE FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE!!

Millions of new people joined this sub and thought everyone's becoming a millionaire but never saw a loss porn in their life til recently. 

So let's take a step back and see what we've accomplished and what we can accomplish further.

We've disrupted the media, Wall Street, and even politics. What did we find out? That there's so many behind the door rules that we don't know about. 

When Elon asked Vlad what the formula is that determines the cost of the Clearinghouse operates, the Robinhood CEO doesn't have a clear answer. He just states that the people behind those doors are good guys and that volatility is a big role. He goes out to defend them but doesn't explain clearly the rules of the game as to how the numbers add up. Take it from an engineer, if 1+1 is not 2, that bridge is held by fucking twigs and will collapse during the next 100year flood. 

Now what about the logic behind shorts decreasing from over 100% to 50%? The price of the stock kept going down from weird transactions with the trading volume so low. 

It doesn't make sense. And we need an explanation. We're playing a numbers game where the rules are set by people that are keeping the rules from the Public. And with that, how the hell can the normal working person live a life with financial freedom?? 

We the people are large enough to seek an answer. It's time the people behind closed doors stop controlling the rules they set to keep themselves comfortable while risking our daily livelihoods. Their actions affect us too much and we need to find a way to separate from their chokehold. 

Sure you can listen to ""logic"" and cash out. It might benefit you personally. 

As to those remaining in the fight, we need answers. We need to know what's going on behind those closed doors. It's time the game stops and the power goes back to the people.",2021-02-03 19:58:39

GME: Calm the Fuck Down,440,lbk9gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbk9gg/gme_calm_the_fuck_down/,53,1612374836.0,"Let me start this by saying that I have GME and I’m holding. I very much want it to go back up and I think it will. But it’s going to take a while. 

Stop with the posts that say “the last time it went to $112, it then jumped to 420.69”. Even if that were true: so what? You can’t use past behavior to predict what is going to happen, especially here in this particular case and especially when that past history is a week ago. 

Also, stop with the magical TA posts. It’s great that you have crayons, but drawing random lines doesn’t mean the stock is going to follow the pattern you think you see. Especially in a period of high volatility.

The short squeeze may not even happen (or maybe it did and fizzled, though I don’t think so). There’s no law that says it must. It won’t happen unless there’s a reason shorts have to sell en masse.

I get it, confirmation of your biases feels good. But living your life that way is begging for disappointment. 

For posters: would you post your predictions if it meant a permanent ban if your prediction was wrong?

For readers: do you think posters would post their optimistic predictions if it meant risking a permanent ban from the sub?

Calm down. It could still get very bloody and if you’re holding, you might have to do so for a long time.

We can potentially cause the entire situation to blow up. Imagine a situation where at least half the sub buys at least one stock in the same day guess what happens the couple of hundred of shares in the short ladder attack don't matter anymore and due to the low float we could easily see a price increase of over 200% in a single day which will inevitably cause some paper hand shorts to cover causing the short squeeze 2.0.

TLDR; Buying on low float can easily cause GME to double or triple in a single day causing Short squeeze 2.0

This is us, the diamond hands, standing our ground next to the King DFV]",224,lbjv0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjv0f/motivation_wednesday_gme_my_diary_notes_remember/,38,1612373067.0,"Day three of the second week of the fight.

Dear diary,

Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.

We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we weren’t market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.

However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.

However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didn’t know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.

The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do: *WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.*

And that’s what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack… We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wife’s boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response…

But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.

This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.

BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?

Another Perspective for GME,157,lbjle0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbjle0/another_perspective_for_gme/,43,1612371880.0,"This truly is a long play (I know, obviously — but want to write it out for people worried or on the fence). I think GME didn’t issue more shares at the inflated prices because it would have angered retail and risked even the slightest thought of GME also being a bad guy — given the intense amount of people on the hype train and the Twitter storms etc. It also would have given institutions a legit reason to drive price down.

I think Ryan Cohen and crew are waiting for this to die down, lose media attention, and let the price bottom out and consolidate before they continue to announce things. I also don’t think they’ll do a share offering until a couple of quarters from now (when price has risen steadily but big). The more I think about this, the more I think it’ll end up like TSLA. I think GME is about to have a stellar year or next two years, while squeezing shorts to <10% gradually. Shorts also won’t give up until GME starts putting up consecutive, big earnings numbers and milestones; just like Tesla did. 

I believe Ryan Cohen will turn this company around. He is proud (and rightfully so) of how he built Chewy and is clearly a success-driven leader. I am sure he is already getting excited to come out of this as the hero (just like Elon). 

A few popular DD’s were posted about this but last Thursday nearly (I think missed by minutes) triggered an explosive move and the real squeeze of GME. Now that it has been suppressed, I unfortunately believe a rapid squeeze won’t happen; and again, I think GME will rise steadily — and have some big weeks this year. I know it’s not the confirmation bias we all seek, but there has been some solid level-headed DD come out recently and I think if people aren’t setup for the long haul, they need to take a step back and position for that. For example: imagine getting in TSLA at $200 with a ton of shares and LEAPs; now, those folks are sitting on +300% gains and know the true meaning of holding long. 

Position: 3/19 175c (will be cutting soon and pushing out expiry) & 30 shares (avg. cost $172) 

TL;DR: Reposition for the long haul — retail will win in the end, it just might take the rest of this year.",2021-02-03 19:04:40

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion.

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.",2021-02-03 19:04:25

"PLTR Upcoming ER, Lockup, 13F 🚀",144,lbj2b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbj2b5/pltr_upcoming_er_lockup_13f/,56,1612369452.0,"Many of you clicking on this post are probably aware that **PLTR**🚀 has officially announced their **earnings** date for Tuesday, **Feb 16th** at **8am.** This means that the **lockup expiry** occurs that **Friday, Feb 19th (3 days after Q4 earnings release according to the S1 filing)**. [Link to PLTR Investor relations website](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Announces-Date-of-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Release-and-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

Everyone knows, in the majority of cases, going into lockup and the day of lockup the share price declines only to immediately start to rebound the day following lockup. In PLTR's🚀 case, lockup has undoubtedly been a drag on the share price with many 🌈🐻 shorting and fellow palansmarts waiting to buy in because of it. In this post I will provide my reasons why I am holding through lockup and why I think starting to scale in before earnings and lockup is a good idea (Also I am a retard so don't take anything I say seriously).

&#x200B;

1. Having earnings before the market open usually means that earnings is bullish, or so I have heard, because management is confident enough in the quarterly numbers to not give the market time to digest them. With all of the new contracts PLTR's🚀 earnings should be a healthy beat.
2. February 16th is the last day for institutions to file their 13F with the SEC to let everyone know what they have bought or sold for the 4th quarter. I am guessing based off of PLTR's🚀 run this past quarter that many institutions have taken up position and that will be revealed on the 16th/17th. The reveal of these big buyers will cause a bit of fomo and look bullish, giving the market reaction to earnings a bullish bias.
3. Just because something like 80% (I have seen % ranging from 80 to \~66%) of locked up shares will be available to trade doesn't mean insiders will actually sell. We know that at the very least Karp and Peter are planning on holding shares/ownership stake through private investment firms that they own (Mithril Capital Management). That said there should be selling pressure... the obvious play. 
4. PLTR🚀 is currently \~31% off of it's intraday high from 4 days ago! There has been heavy shorting on low volume going on before yesterday's official earnings announcement. Now that we have a set date and the uncertainty has been removed we could see a bit of a run up into earnings. This is currently, in my opinion, providing a good entry point that may not last. 

The fear of lockup is probably worse than the actual event.

I will likely hold for at least a year unless PLTR🚀 decides to moon and free me from my 9-5.

I've been a member of this sub for a long time. I know this post is going to get downvoted, but I've got to make it because I am very concerned that we could have a wave of self harm urges depending on the way GME moves.

Please. For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.

Eventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you. 

Once the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.

When things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.

I've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.

Some people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck. These kinds of movements are super exciting, but getting trapped with a large amount or margin amount high up on a flimsy spike can lead to self harm.

Which is why I want to urge you to use the hotline. If you're in a very bad place right now, please, use the hotline. Please don't use a permanent solution.

I love all of you guys. I love the memes you make. This part of the internet has been my favorite place for a long time. And I want all of us to keep making memes and having fun. Please be safe.",2021-02-03 18:21:47

Brief Thoughts on GME,67,lbixik,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbixik/brief_thoughts_on_gme/,51,1612368850.0,"""by the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian—that is, a creature acting by instinct.""

Firstly, a few things:

1. People are here to make money, getting too attached to a stock by emotion and not rational analysis is not the way, as individuals, we should be looking to make plays with the maximum reward adjusted for risk (multi-baggers are nice, but what is the probability of it happening in each case? consistency is better). So if you can't defend your thesis, or even have a thesis on your position, you shouldn't hold or even buy. Sticking it up to wall street or buying it because everyone is doing can convince you to buy, but it's not a thesis. Understanding the opposite side of your trade and their thesis is an important part of this.
2. In order to have any sort of reasonable discussion, the participants need to agree on a common factual basis, and the scientific method in that anything can be disproven if given enough evidence. If data is a part of your argument, the source is of the essence. People laugh at antivaxx or flat earth groups, but they do the same thing (be dismissive and ignore all evidence against their beliefs) when it comes to ""truths"" they hold dear.
3. All investments are fundamentally a matter of price. The best company can be overvalued and the worst undervalued. The same GME is obviously a radically different investment when your average is 40 vs 400 for the individual who is investing. Let's say both embraces the possibility of losing their money, and aim for 1000. Well with the same probability of succeeding the odds are 1:25 and 1:2.5. There are much more opportunities in the market for 2.5 baggers than 25 baggers.

The Bear Case hinges on:

Given the amount of information at hand, what is the fundamental value of GME right now, how much should one price in Cohen succeeding in transforming the business? Those who short will be using fundamentals, since the momentum of the short-squeeze will eventually revert to a fair price. What that fair price is is debatable. How long that reversion happens will depend on the relative positioning of longs and shorts. But is likely that institutions have little faith in the ability of retail traders (who are majority long) to diamond hands.

So if you agree with the following:

1. GME is currently overvalued.
2. The short interest is low relative adjusted for time and probability of GME reverting back to fair value due to retail investors being fundamentally feeble: institutions are willing to hold much longer (see how much Melvin Capital blew up on their positions) until their thesis play out versus people who may not even have a thesis (not necessarily WSB, but retail who got sucked in past few weeks in general).

Then it obviously makes sense to short, some firms may have blown up themselves shorting at much lower levels, but other firms may have seen GME as an extremely attractive target while it soared past 40 and into the hundreds, there were even people on CNBC who blatantly said they were opening put positions, so this isn't much of a leap in faith.

My thoughts:

I would much rather put my money on the fundamental value of GME expanding rather than betting on a low probability event happening (the easy money has already been made, stop being greedy thinking GME making another 20x is at the same conditions as the last 20x). If we put the short-squeeze out of the equation, the drop from 469 is making GME rapidly approach a level where the risk-reward ratio based on fundamentals is something I'm comfortable with.

TLDR: Best time to enter/add is when the fundamental bull case for GME stands on its own, looking to enter around 40 where I will diamond hands until more signs of whether Cohen will succeed or fail in turning GME around (which will be a 10-20 bagger based on around 3B valuation)

positions: Sold 20C at cost basis 11 on 1100 shares so call me retarded

EDIT:

Anyone who thinks I'm bearish on GME is retarded and has not read the post. I have great faith in Cohen, but it's not a certainty, I am opening a position with a favorable risk rewards ratio with regards to how likely I think GME is to succeed in the next year to next few years.",2021-02-03 18:14:10
How and why NOK will reach the moon?,263,lbitv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbitv7/how_and_why_nok_will_reach_the_moon/,59,1612368388.0,"NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.

&nbsp;


**Information advantage**

- The hedge funds will always have quicker, better access to information than all of WSB. 

**Coordination advantage**

- They are one big organized entity, and can move their entire “Army” of bets with infinitesimal speed. 

**Size advantage**

- The hedges have more money at stake and in play than all of WSB put together.

**Ally advantage**

- They have powerful collaborators. The media, who doesn’t want a hedge fund to go bust. You can assume, the US government (and every other government), because they don’t want a stock market crash. And everyone who colludes with hedge funds, i.e. all of corporate America.

**Propaganda advantage**

- Whether it be social media posts, bots, articles in mainstream media, they have enough money to blast out as much fake statistics and propaganda as they like. WSB does not.
 
**Mathematical advantage**

- A lot of trading has become complicated math. You can assume that every single analyst they have/need is working on the math to get them out of the hole they have dug themselves in. We are less good at math.

**Speed & Precision advantage**

- They can make trades and bets much faster, with a much higher precision than WSB.

**Strategic advantage**

- You can assume the hedge funds know your position, but you don’t know theirs. This in my mind is the most powerful of all advantages for them. Imagine you are playing chess against an opponent and have to decide which pieces to move, but aren’t allowed to see where theirs are? But they can ever *read your thoughts* (i.e. this forum).

**Legal advantage**

- Given the very very light penalties even for something patently illegal in financial manipulations, it is in their very interest to do anything whose cost is “cheaper” than the potential cost of the actual monetary loss, whether it be legal or not. If you were the CEO/Fund manager, you too would decide for illegality.

&nbsp;


So, the question then becomes, given this situation, in which for the hedge funds not only billions are at stake, but the narrative of their ability to make the market, and the propaganda of expertise they disseminate, how does WSB win and force the Short Squeeze? What are WSB's advantages? How do you make best use of them? Who are WSB's allies? How can they be activated? How do you deceive the enemy? How do you overwhelm them, tactically?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

A few initial thoughts on counter-strategies (Feel free to suggest more, and I'll add them in):

- The strongest narrative that might influence public/politics is that the stock market is a casino, and the house is not just taking its fees, but cheating. The stock market is no longer a ""free market"", but a place where big players make the rules, and use their wealth to make more wealth for themselves.

- WSB needs to find and activate allies. These might be the company itself (GME), value investors who believe in the free market and its efficiency, political/investment figures who want investment to actually mean something.

- Some disadvantages need to be turned into disadvantages. For example, it will be difficult to impossible for WSB to move in concert without alerting the ""enemy"" to its own ovements. So, how does one coordinate a move in which transparency becomes an advantage?

Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 -﻿ If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&#x200B;

2﻿ - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&#x200B;

3 -﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&#x200B;

4﻿ -﻿ Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product.

Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?,331,lbi6em,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbi6em/do_the_the_skeptical_claims_about_gme_even_make/,80,1612365524.0,"Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.

**1. The shorts have covered!**

The poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \~120% going into Friday, down to \~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions—purportedly \~70%—on Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares *en masse,* as is being claimed.

**2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!**

No, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and ""hide"" the supposed *massive* covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down—at least, it would not have decreased from \~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been ""averaging up"" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.

**3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)**

Again, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing *en masse* while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.

It seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted **and** without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?

Maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.

If the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.

If we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was ""the squeeze."" That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.

Hopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable. Am I just retarded?   💎🙌",2021-02-03 17:18:44

Are you sure Melvin is still short GME?

First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.

Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. 

Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.

In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.

Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.

All the best.",2021-02-03 16:59:27

All it's going to take is another small yolo. The market cap for ornamental gourds is very small and stupid Big Hedge Fund is shorting wrecklessly. Don't believe me? Just look at this chart:

I don't know about you, but this clearly looks like a cup and handle pattern to me. All the ingredients are there. Shorts, cups, gourds, and a small market cap. All we have to do is BUY and 💎✋ until the 🍆s go 🚀🚀🚀. I know it's been a hard week, but scared money doesn't make money. Take another mortgage if you've already withdrawn your pension fund. **All in on ornamental gourds futures.** Put on your helmets.

Buy ornamental gourds futures if you want your wifes back.

Every time short sale ratio goes up we hold and buy the dip. As they lose steam we pile on and stonk goes higher. 

**Push and Pull**

1/27 onwards it seems traders have got involved heavily and while short ratio has remained consistent  (>50%), most of the volume is downtrading suggesting paper hands are being shaken out. As data suggest, new short positions were opened at peak price on 1/27 . While, Most of the squeeze happened with heavy volume in first round. I guess, the question to ask is what is required to trigger second round.

1) buy volume increase / reduced short sale ratio ? ( fellow retards currently waiting for account transfers)

2) Failure to delivery deadlines approaching ?

3) More good news from management/board, RC etc.

The bootlickers over at TradeRepublic gave this sorry excuse today for their GME shenanigans,44,lbhu8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbhu8u/the_bootlickers_over_at_traderepublic_gave_this/,13,1612364094.0,"DEAR W1ND,


we look back at a special week with unprecedented developments in stocks like GameStop or AMC.

We want to personally apologize to you, if you have been affected by the buy restrictions on those stocks! We haven’t done a great job explaining the reasoning behind our decisions. Below we answer many questions that you have asked us in the past days.

Those decisions were difficult and within a special market environment. Eventually, we failed to explain our thoughts to you and didn't get to the bottom of the problem in our communication. Some of you criticized us for our actions, others have been understanding. Thank you.

We have not managed to live up to your expectations towards a modern, democratic and free broker. We will continue to work very hard to improve things, while trying to be open, transparent, clear and to the point.

We started Trade Republic five years ago to build a better bank. We are excited that you are a part of Trade Republic’s community. Part of a group that empowers people across Europe to have easy, fast and free access to capital markets.

Many thanks
Christian, Thomas & Marco
Founders of Trade Republic



Why did Trade Republic stop buy orders for stocks like GameStop or AMC on Thursday?

We started the last week with new highs in transactions, active customers and without any problems. On Thursday, shortly after 7:30 a.m., our trading venue Lang & Schwarz Exchange (LSX) suffered from a significant outage. This was due to database overloads at one of LSX's service providers. We then switched to our fallback trading venue Tradegate Exchange. After a few hours, the tremendous increase of orders in stocks such as GameStop or AMC led to delays in the execution of orders. Trading had to be temporarily suspended to increase capacity.

Trading started again in the afternoon. This was followed by another heavy load on the systems with several thousand orders per minute. To prevent further outages, we decided not to accept any buy orders for six stocks, including GameStop and AMC, after the XETRA close at 5:30 p.m. We decided to do this to ensure the availability of our service for our customers. There were concerns that there could have been rapid declines in prices for stocks such as GameStop and AMC in the wake of particularly high volatility. Technical delays could have resulted in losses for you. That’s what we were referring to when mentioning “risks to you” in our first message.


Why did Trade Republic block only buy and not sell orders for those six stocks?

Essentially, the additional number of orders for those six stocks overloaded the systems. However, we wanted to continue to allow sell transactions. It was important to us to give customers who held those highly volatile stocks the opportunity to sell the shares to take profits or limit losses.


Why was the limitation of trading lifted again on Friday?

We worked through the night and our team massively scaled up our resources. Our tests have shown that the systems remain stable even with a considerable order load. As a result, we decided to start full trading on Friday before the market opened at 7:30 a.m. On Friday we again saw peak activities but our systems ran without problems.


Why do you say in the first message that you want to protect the customers from risks?

Trade Republic stands for free access to the capital market and offers various asset classes. We do not want to tell our users what to invest in. Our first message to our customers was misleading. We did not distinguish well enough between the explanation (technical risks) and the information (risks of volatile stocks). At Trade Republic, many people are investing their money in stocks for the first time. Due to the unique events in the markets, we wanted to inform about the risks associated with volatile stocks for our customers who are invested in those. More risk information will be added to the app in the future.


Has BaFin ordered the resumption of trading?

No. Trade Republic is in constant exchange with the BaFin. Trade Republic has informed BaFin about the steps mentioned above. The decision to resume trading was made independently by Trade Republic. Contrary to media claims, Trade Republic was not admonished about non-compliance with regulation by the BaFin on Thursday. Following incidents and outages, Trade Republic continues to report to the supervisory authority and provides comprehensive information on the case.


Can something like this happen again?

Our systems easily coped with the maximum load of trading last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as Friday. Without the technical error of the service provider at Lang & Schwarz Exchange, Thursday would have also been a quiet, normal day. As a result, we have greatly increased our server capacity and load testing. At the same time, we are investing massively in our technical infrastructure to improve our offering further.


Has Trade Republic responded to third-party pressure? Does Trade Republic have relationships with hedge funds?

No. Trade Republic has never had and does not have any relationships with hedge funds or similar market participants. The decision was made by Trade Republic independently and only from a technical point of view.


Did Trade Republic respond to pressure from clearing houses? Were there liquidity bottlenecks?

No. Trade Republic settles all transactions with HSBC - one of the largest settlement providers in the world. There were no limitations in clearing & settlement in any way. Trade Republic does not have to maintain liquidity for clearing.


Does Trade Republic sell data to hedge funds so they can trade against it to make money (""frontrunning"")?

No. Trade Republic conducts its trades through the Hamburg Stock Exchange which is controlled by a supervisory authority appointed by the Hamburg Senate. Trade Republic does not sell any data to third parties. Trading takes place at reference market prices, e.g. from XETRA. Different to what is claimed in the media, the business model of Trade Republic is not comparable to the model of Robinhood.


Does Trade Republic lend out my securities?

No. Trade Republic never lends out securities.


Thank You!

His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

                          -----   

“What the fuck do you mean you’re out of money, Dale?!” His father bellowed.
Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.
If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

They said I’d make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There’s no way it could’ve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-

“Did you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?”
There’s no way out. I’m fucked. I don’t have any money. I need to tell him.

“Yes.”
“WHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!”
Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.

""Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!""

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?
I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.

""Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-""

“FUCK!”
His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders.
Yummy!

A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:

Start of part deux of the GME short squeeze,147,lbhmsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbhmsd/start_of_part_deux_of_the_gme_short_squeeze/,33,1612363197.0,"""**If  long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new buying opportunity,  we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short squeeze.By Ihor Dusaniwsky**

**The momentum against GameStop picked up on  Tuesday morning as the short-squeeze rallies fueled by traders on  Reddit's** r/WallStreetBets **forum started to unwind. Shares of the retail  investor favorite were sent tumbling as hedge funds and Reddit traders  alike were left to wonder what’s to come for the volatile stock.**

**Yesterday, GME saw continued short covering,  but to a much smaller extent than it had experienced over the last few  days. With today’s stock price weakness, we should expect short covering  to be minimal, with the possibility that momentum shorts jump into the  trade. Stock borrow availability has increased so shorts are once again  able to add on to or initiate short positions.**

**And GME’s fall may not be over: What may  exacerbate its stock slide are long shareholders trimming their holdings  and realizing some of the unrealized gains they’ve earned as GME’s  stock price skyrocketed.**

**S3 data helps tell the whole story. Now, GME  short interest is $5.81 billion, with 26.09 million shares shorted.  Traditional SI % Float is down significantly from its highs in the  140’s% at the beginning of January. The SI % of Float is st 51.13% and  the S3 SI % of Float, which includes synthetic longs created by short  sales, is at 33.83%, telling us that there’s ample stock loan supply for  short sellers to access, should they want to short more shares. The  stock borrow fee on existing shorts is 19%, while the stock borrow fee  on new shorts is 10% to 20% fee.**

**Over the last week, the number of GME shares  shorted has decreased by -37.24 million shares, worth $8.4 billion, a  decrease of -59% as its stock price rose +193%. We saw just over 1  million shares covered yesterday. Shorts are down -$9.5 billion in  year-to-date mark-to-market losses, -278% for the year, and are up  +$3.08 billion in profits on today’s -52% price move ($107.00).**

**If long shareholders begin to sell their  positions, expect short sellers to jump in and help GME’s stock slide  continue. But if long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new  buying opportunity, we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short  squeeze.**

Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.

If there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.

Hopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the ""value"" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.

It's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.

The unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.

I'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a ""movement"" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.

DFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.

If you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.

So now everyone is getting on the GME bandwagon because that’s how DFV made his money right? Yes, he did invest in GME but he did it by buying LEAPS. 

If you don’t know what LEAPS are they are options a year or more out. DFV bought low priced leaps and it paid off big time.  The thing is, in the last year, anyone could have basically invested in anything  and made a profit. 

The second thing he did was go big. Investing $100 isn’t going to change your life appreciably except in the most improbable circumstances. Risk what you can, but be willing to lose it all.

Some questions about GME,132,lbgs9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbgs9s/some_questions_about_gme/,62,1612359828.0,"Alright retards I think there are some questions that need to be answered as far as GME goes. All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand, 🦍 together strong means GME will go to the moon. 

Look I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media.

I know this is starting to sound negative, but I’m not a 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I’m not fucking selling💎👐.

With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I’ll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.

1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We’ve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren’t going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?

2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I’ve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I’m wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?

3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They’re obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they’ve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?

4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can’t read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven’t had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What’s going to happen going forward with RH?

5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?

That’s all I got for now. I’ll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren’t relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard. 

Would love for other people to comment any questions they have as well, so we can get a bigger picture of GME going forward.",2021-02-03 15:43:48

SweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states

SweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US & more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

>Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying “woah”. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you’ll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF** – *Loud without the cloud*
>Not for the un-inspired, RIFF’s brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer** – *it is always sunny with Solei*
>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

Future of Manufacturing: Desktop Metal (DM): short term and long term play,65,lbgiy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbgiy0/future_of_manufacturing_desktop_metal_dm_short/,29,1612358844.0,"Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read 😌,27,lbg9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbg9oc/skt_dd_tanger_outlet_malls_value_play_please_read/,42,1612357867.0,"9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

Takeaways from GME - Where do we go from here?,124,lbg9ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbg9ha/takeaways_from_gme_where_do_we_go_from_here/,105,1612357846.0,"**The Free Market Isn't Free**

I have learned a lot in the last two weeks and I hope that some of you have as well. And I'm not talking about the fundamentals of investment, trading, or strategy. I'm talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another. Obviously this is an ever-evolving situation, but I think it's worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we, both as a community and as individuals, can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice.

I'm not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this. It's immaterial to my thesis. What was exposed, first and foremost in my mind, is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors. If possible, we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages and/or mirror them for the retail investor. I'll get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later, but first let's dig into the advantages themselves.


**Advantages Afforded to the Institutional Investor**

*Access to Assets* 

One of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets. Hence, there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party, an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing. The events of last Thursday show us this is not the case. Many, if not most brokerages, restricted access to an in-demand asset, leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely, but not to buy freely. Again, this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect, only an observation that it was the effect that occurred. In my opinion RH had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way.

Institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does, instead trading directly between one another. This creates a sub-market that exists direct-to-seller that retail investors couldn't dream of. As such, they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in. Moreover, insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile, it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale.

*Access to Information*

This one is quite a bit simpler. Institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves, up-to-the-millisecond data on market-wide trends, in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move. In short, while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate, it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor.

*Access to Capital*

The impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways:

First, the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to single-handedly impact the market for a stock. This is why GME went down into the low single digits to begin with (along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts, which are illegal as fuck). This ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the People's Short Squeeze™ is essentially the same thing. So in that sense we're on an even playing field, right? Wrong. In order for our side to achieve the desired effect, we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable. As soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands, the whole thing falls apart. Now imagine what would have happened if Melvin weren't a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will. Realistically, half of them would have paper-handed out long before they shorted 140% of the free float of GME and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point.

Second, access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead. This is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is Citron/Citadel/Melvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there can't possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose. There is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor.

Finally, access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless. If institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million, you'd better believe they'll do it every time. Their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs. Whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority. Meanwhile if you or I get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo message-board, there's a very real possibility we go to jail.

**Mitigating Disparities of Access**

So, the game is rigged. We've always known that. But the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how that's achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that we've never before been empowered. If you don't know how you're getting fucked, you'll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you... that's what my dad always told my anyways.

*Anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities, but the key here is that we start having the discussions. If every idea I pose gets torn down because it's retarded (and I'm sure that they all are) I'll still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth.*

I think it's time we start to completely re-imagine the way that small money invests and that we'd be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to, and completely independent from, the existing stock exchanges of the world. This secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities.

So how do we achieve these goals? Here's a list of guiding principles I've come up with:

- This marketplace should be open at all times, without closures or halts to the sale of any security.
- Member traders have access to all their assets at all times. 
- To ensure this, no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would; the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into, out of, and between one another. 
- Such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect, and allow for built-in avenues for both direct and community-wide communication between its member traders.
- To prevent the manipulation of this exchange, limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred INTO but not out of an account. This allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money, while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market.
- No liquidity should be required by the exchange itself. To achieve this end, trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed
- All accounts should be linked to existing brokerage/bank account(s) belonging to one person and validated against gov-issued ID. This prevents bad-faith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts.
- All members’ profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual, but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out. This allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading.
- Stocks only; no short positions. Don't get me wrong, shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and re-selling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns.
- All Intra-Market trades and trends should be visible to all member traders.

I hope you've enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard. My ideas are probably garbage but they're garbage born of a desire to find a better way. Even if I haven't done that myself, I hope that we can do it together. Apes together strong. Have a good night.

""...broker-dealers  are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as  exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their  documented policies and procedures. Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception.

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

Quick DD: Why S3 Partners' Short interest data is either BS or it is saying shorts doubled down,196,lbfzw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfzw6/quick_dd_why_s3_partners_short_interest_data_is/,31,1612356968.0,"Courtesy to u/smohyee for inspiration and picture

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 """"it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) """"

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

Who in their right mind would take massive losses and sell their shares when the price is, say, $5/share? Why not just hold and hope for a brighter day down the road? They have to keep the price above a reasonable level so that those shares wont be locked up.

Most of those 👨‍🚀🦍 who got in at <$30 are locked in on principal or are playing with the house's money. They aren't going to budge. The easiest people to shake will be those who bought in late. We are now below the $100 psychological level where paperhanded bitches will fold given enough time.

My guess is the play COULD be to seesaw from maybe $50 to $90 with occasional blips down into the 30s or lower to make it APPEAR as if the price is both settling and volatile enough to warrant a rapid descent. It could go on for days or weeks depending on what their books look like. That will scare a fuck ton of the bitches out of the game AND put the diamond handed retards in a position where they might actually consider selling.

So what's OUR play? As always: HOLD. This can only go on for so long. The shorts have to get covered. They are lying and manipulating to minimize losses but those who stay in the game will be rewarded IF we all call their bluff.

This is a fact. 

They are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position, proof included.

[This shows](https://twitter.com/Laowai_Koala/status/1356603457424171015?s=20) the massive net short position that banks have in the silver futures market.  And if you want to look it up yourself you can [right here.](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f)

Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes

Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it’s the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.

You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that’s your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We’re not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn’t try to ban one another. 

There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.

Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged. 

When it’s speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it’s the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn’t affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.  

This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won’t use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don’t use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won’t be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.

The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it’s pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.  

Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents. The trade appeals to a broader audience than just WSB though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.",2021-02-03 14:54:30
FISV WILL DOUBLE BEFORE EOY,3,lbfw9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfw9l/fisv_will_double_before_eoy/,30,1612356602.0,"Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it’s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here’s a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL’s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that’s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square’s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPL’s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn’t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it’s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader.

Post $GME and $AMC - Next Potential Short Squeeze Target ($TLRY),0,lbftmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbftmg/post_gme_and_amc_next_potential_short_squeeze/,75,1612356334.0,"For those of you still holding $GME and $AMC, Congratulations! Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the ""early part"" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

Thank you and trade well,

STOP OVER THINKING EVERYTHING AND SELLING YOUR FELLOW APES SHORT.

If you have to talk about how cool you are,  you're not that cool.   LIKEWISE - IF YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'VE COVERED YOUR SHORTS - YOU HAVEN'T BLOODY WELL COVERED.

What we are seeing is manipulation on a positively MASSIVE scale.  They will continue to:  insult us, distract us, mislead us and spread FUD at full fucking throttle.  Do you know why? 

THEY WANT YOUR BANANAS.  THEY NEED YOUR BANANAS.

IF THEY DON'T GET THEM,  THEY LOSE BIG.

So - my furry friends, bust open your favorite Final Fantasy, MMORPG or whatever other video game you have on your platform du jour  AND FIGHT A BOSS.  There are phases,  tactics,  nuanced mechanics that you have to master to win.

Tune out the noise and realize that WE ARE IN THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS BOSS FIGHT.  THE BORING PHASE THAT EVERYONE HATES BECAUSE YOUR DPS DOESN'T MATTER AND YOU HAVE TO WALK HALFWAY ACROSS THE MAP TO FINISH AND WILL PROBABLY DIE OF BOREDOM ON THE WAY. 

YOUR MOVES HAVEN'T CHANGED AND ARE STILL 9000+ POWER LEVEL. THEY DON'T GET TO REGENERATE FOR FREE.

HOLD, BTFD AND YOU WILL MAKE HISTORY WORTH READING

"GME urgent RE-EDUCATION - unify, clarify, focus and execute",7881,lbfq7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfq7d/gme_urgent_reeducation_unify_clarify_focus_and/,696,1612356006.0,"How can I start this.. the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification  if we are to steer this thing back onto the road.Whether we want to admit it or not, we're fucking drifting atm. The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability (""we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy"").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!!,151,lbfhhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbfhhd/do_not_buy_calls_in_margin_account/,19,1612355178.0,"It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I’m buying more tomorrow, see y’all in space.

TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I💎🤲 until it hits $10 a share as it’s 5G grows in the coming years.

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

In the above article you see the outline of the new Air defense platform the army has purchased. It shoots Raytheon Stinger missiles.  It also shoots Lockheed Hellfire missiles. Some varients can shoot raytheon lockheed co-developed Javelin missile. Some have been delivered. To EUCOM first for NATO Air Defense missions, with more ordered for more Army units that haven't even been created yet. 

In 2012-2014 the army did an audit to determine that Short range Air defense was majorly deficient in numbers and capabilities. There is demand for their services. And they do other things besides missiles. Like CIWS and LPWS.
