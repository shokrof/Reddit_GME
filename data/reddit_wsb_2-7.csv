The robinhood tin foil stuff may or may not be true.

Never once did I see anyone on wsb say anything about sticking it to the shorts, or the inequality of wealth. It was always about an opportunity to make some money, same as always. This sub was rarely ever political in its discourse. 

Fast forward to the peak of the squeeze, it‚Äôs all anyone is talking about even way outside of our little finance/stock market/casino world. They were talking about GameStop on espn, ‚ÄúNew mets owner involved in GameStop short squeeze??‚Äù Anyway, even before robinhood limited trading, the media started to build this narrative that we all colluded on this forum to take down Wall Street. As someone who is on this sub every day, I never heard anyone say a damn thing about taking down Wall Street until the media started peddling this story and millions of new members flooded the sub with their far-left ideals. For those of you who have a negative opinion about Wall Street and got in on GME to try and take down a hedge fund, that‚Äôs fine you do you.

GME IS NOT OVER. PURE FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS: (WHY HOLDING AND BUYING WILL ALLOW US TO WIN),1000,le04ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le04ps/gme_is_not_over_pure_fundamental_analysis_why/,213,1612655281.0,"Short interest was 140% at one point. But please try and understand; this means that even if they were to purchase all outstanding shares, there would still be artificial stocks left over which need to be bought to cover their positions.

Because this is true, every-time someone buys more shares at this time (whether it‚Äôs to cover or hold) an I-O-U and an FTD are generated simultaneously.

If there are no authentic shares left to cover for short positions, whenever an investor purchases a share then a broker has to generate an I-O-U instead. This is what creates the artificial supply of stock in the market, and this is precisely the huge problem for institutions.

Every-time this happens, the amount of phantom stock that needs to be purchased to to cover all of the I-O-Us in the system increases. The system is not supposed to have shares that are unaccounted for, and someone (the people failing to deliver on short positions that generate I-O-Us in the system) will eventually need to buy them to restore the balance of the system.

Usually this isn‚Äôt a problem for them, since they are able to drive the price of each share so low that they are able to acquire all of these phantom shares at a ridiculously low cost to where it just doesn‚Äôt matter - they still generate a profit even if they have to buy a bunch of shares that don‚Äôt actually exist.

However, we have the power to use their own strategy against them. By forcing them to generate more and more counterfeit shares to meet the crazy demand that they create when they ‚Äòstrategically fail to deliver‚Äô (by generating I-O-Us they need to pay for later) we can force the cost of shorting to increase and force the price of shares to rise. This has the potential to create an even bigger squeeze (if my assumptions are correct).

So, the plan is the same as always: hold and buy relentlessly. The more we do this the more times their short positions fail to deliver. The more FTDs = more I-O-Us. The more I-O-Us there are, the higher artificial supply rises. This raises short interest whilst bringing the price of each share down. However this causes a chain reaction if people continue to buy during this period. The cycle wont end and they will be stuck forever generating artificial stock/counterfeit shares to cover the debt of shares they created. This will dry up their liquidity and cause them to cover massively very quickly eventually. This will cause squeeze 2.0.

Essentially, it‚Äôs like musical chairs (but with a few twists) As long as the music continues, more participants can play than there are chairs available, but when the amount of FTDs and I-O-Us in the system increase and deplete liquidity, the music stops and everyone needs to find a seat. 

Even if all the retail players left (sold) and they had all the chairs to themselves, there still wouldn‚Äôt be enough chairs for them to keep the game balanced. Instead, they‚Äôre hoping that all their players that got to sit down are allowed to leave after this round. This way they need less of their players to sit down next round and the game can become balanced once again. We cause problems when we all decide to join the game and play with them - since there will never be enough chairs for everyone.

Eventually, there are loads of players, but hardly any chairs. When the music stops, demand for a chair is high and each one becomes more valuable. All the players that didn‚Äôt get to sit down now have to pay the host to allow them to continue playing. But they need to buy our chairs off of us if they want to eventually leave the game alltogether. 

So my message is this: Please do not get discouraged. This moment is unprecedented. I really don‚Äôt think people understand how crazy 140% short interest is/was and the implications of this. This is what Michael Burry was referring to in his tweet about his broker not being able to find his shares in May (or March? I cant remember) 2020. There were so many counterfeit shares in the system even back then that he realised this and I feel like he was implying that this is how we win. By gaming their own game.

Elon Musk is no Tony Stark,0,ldzseq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldzseq/elon_musk_is_no_tony_stark/,65,1612654217.0,"Elon Musk (South African) is just an early investor who invested 6 million he had won selling his Paypal stocks months after Tesla was created by Eberhard and Tarpenning (Americans)

Elon likes to take credit for Tesla and the Tesla vision and mission, but he had nothing to do with its creation. 

In 2009, Elon used his lawyers to force the original founders Eberhard and Tarpenning through a lawsuit, that Elon won with his power, where he was granted the ""right"" to call himself a co-founder as well.

No wonder he supported Trump. He is just like him. He likes to take credit for things he did not even create.

He is no Tony Stark. He is just a bully investor who stole the credit from two American engineers.


He has used his persuasive tacticts to accumulate a cult of young minions that have invested all their savings in a company that produced losses until 2020. 

In 2020, Tesla had a positive net income for the first time since it was founded. The 2020 net income was a microscopic 721 million, which is nothing compared to the tens of billions that Honda and Toyota made in 2020.

Based on car sales, it is worth 12 billions.

Tesla is recalling a big portion (+130,000) of its cars while it only produces 500,000 a year. That forced Elon Musk to appear on Instagram this week to persuade his brainwashed young investors to buy the dip. He is a master manipulator.

Young investors will get burned, and he doesn't care.

Tesla is a bubble. It will make many investors lose a lot of money. See GME, individual investors got burned really burned while hedge funds made hundreds of millions in profits.

Hedge funds are already pulling out of the Tesla bubble. All the naive investors will get hurt again when Tesla collapses.

Tesla has not grown in a month. It already achieved its peak weeks ago, and has been declining.

You should realize your gains.

Ford and GMC are making better and cheaper Electric vehicles than Tesla. Ford and GMC will lead the EV market in one year. Europeans are no longer buying Tesla. Tesla was not even in the top 2 Evs bought by Scandinavians last year.  

The company was productive for many years but it already reached its peak. There is no more room for bubble growth. The cyber truck failed that's why it is not out yet.

It is all a frenzy.

Many scientists have always had their credit stolen by bullies throughout history. This is just another example.

GMC and Ford will dominate the U.S. EV market.

Tesla does not even have repair Tesla shops to handle the recalls. Tesla has to get into agreements with local repair shops to fix that mess.

Tesla is not Space X.

Elon did not just bully the real Tesla founders. He also bullied his employees, and they took him to court.

I am about to go full Auntie here so bear with me.

Reddit is my ""home"". To me wsb is like a frat house down the street. There is always a party, if I wander in I am left shaking my head at the ""silliness"" and what seems like carelessness with money. However, these guys and girls mind their own damn business and apparently business is good. 

Last week 8 million? people walked into their home. Party right? For a day, maybe. The sub was flooded with nonsense posts and comments, flooded with people asking basic investing questions. You know what these guys said? 'If you need investing advice, you're in the wrong place, and you should probably sit this one out.' Some of them cheered with you (emojis... hold...diamonds...etc, etc) because the outlook looked great. New people started talking about risking way too much and these guys partied with you for a minute, then some of them said, 'wait...don't bet everything"" because they know better. New people booed and downvoted, the same people who were days before asking for investment advice, explained to these silly seeming experts how it was done. So, they said, 'oh okay...you do you'. 

Everything peaked, everyone celebrated, these guys told you to get the fuck out before it fell too much. New people downvoted them, called them bots and shills and screamed over them. 

When it kept falling some new people had the fucking audacity to say they had been used by wsb in a pump and dump scheme. Never mind that all of this was in motion and rolling before most of us had heard a whisper of it. They didn't need you, they didn't invite you, though they would have at one time welcomed you. 

Now the new people left are spamming the board and they've stopped giving you advice because they're being downvoted and generally treated like shit in their own home at a time when they would probably like to reflect on what just happened, and do mathy, geeky, chart reading things with their friends. Instead the new people just put ""What's New Pussycat"" on the jukebox for the millionth time, and keep telling the homeowners what they're supposed to be doing in their own home.

Meanwhile, these people are being scrutinized by the freaking world, this party is over, some of them lost money, some made money, and their home is trashed.

You just made an entire post on this sub, the equivalent of tapping a glass and declaring all must stop and listen, then when they respond to you, you ask them why they can't just be quiet in their own home.

I do hope my ADHD brain made all that make sense because I'm not going back to edit. I don't know the people in this sub but I've been following all week just like everyone else. WSB may be the rowdy frat house next door, but as a fellow redditor they're our rowdy neighbors. They will surely welcome anyone in but the best advice I can give all the new people is Talk Less, Listen More. Give them a minute.

It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers,1,le4c62,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/,0,1612667228.0,"Repost, because gaybears admins üêªüåà
Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen?
It‚Äôs simple. Let‚Äôs use the worst possible numbers here.
Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let‚Äôs say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short.
Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let‚Äôs say they covered at 300. You‚Äôre telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we‚Äôre still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would‚Äôve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover.
Hold your fucking shares.
Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.
Edit 2: I know I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised you retards don‚Äôt understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking ZERO. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= -$45 Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I‚Äôm getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money.
Please get your head out of your ass. if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.

**$VISM - Visium Technologies**

It is no surprise to anyone when I say that Cyber Security is a high growth sector of the market, with a lot of young innovative technology. Visium Technologies has created the pioneering CyGraph, which is responsible for stopping the hacking attempt of SolarWinds in December. The hack has now been linked to Chinese hackers, as they were trying to obtain the SolarWinds platform and the sensitive information of SolarWinds clients. (https://www.accesswire.com/621538/Visium).

A month later, Visium Technologies has now attracted the attention of other potential new clients in the Cyber Security sector. In October, it announced the integration with AWS. Now in late January (https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-01-22/visium-technologies-announces-streaming-integration-of-cygraph-with-other-major-cyber-platforms), Visium has announced the integration of joining platforms such as Splunk, Nessus, and NetFlow. This will allow Visium to attract new customers and seamlessly use their CyGraph functionality efficiently and more securely on new platforms.

And now the best part? Visium Technologies has just won a dismissal of the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against the company. The Court ruled in Visium's favor, dismissing the involuntary bankruptcy petition and allowing Visium to file a motion with the Court seeking compensatory and punitive damages. In addition, Visium plans to file an affidavit of fees and costs incurred in connection with Visium's defense of the Involuntary Petition. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visium-technologies-wins-dismissal-involuntary-140000500.html).

NO MORE TOXIC DEBT! MORE CASH FLOW! MORE PLATFORMS! MORE ROOM TO RUN! And let me tell you, CyGraph is a pioneering technology and there is a good chance that big tech may buy this company out as well to add to their portfolio of products. 

The CyGraph technology may have stopped the SolarWinds hack and now they are grabbing the attention of big corporations. Everything has been moving fast lately, but all is pointing in a positive direction for Visium Technologies $VISM. Their latest cryptic tweet was in binary, however, have no fear, as it decodes to ‚Äúpartnership, billion $$ company‚Äù. (https://twitter.com/VisiumAnalytics/status/1357710182168559617).

Update to my post about 68k to 1.25 million in 11 month since people asked me about my strategy,73,le3a7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le3a7j/update_to_my_post_about_68k_to_125_million_in_11/,31,1612664315.0,"Hi All,

I got a lot of requests about my strategy of how I got 68k to 1.25 million. So I decided to share it publicly. Do not mimic my trades but just see how I go about things. Here is the screen shot of performance:

&#x200B;

I benefited from one key point. When March dip happened my analysis pointed to a V-shape bounce back which I think will continue for the foreseeable future. Timing and taking big positions is important. I was short GameSt0p but immediately reversed my position when I saw trends changing. I went long and sold above $300.

What I usually do and have been doing for the past 11 month was using 80% common shares and 20% options strategy. When things got interesting I would even use synthetic shares (long calls/short puts). I do NOT use leverage which helps me sleep better at night.

I do almost 100% of my DD on options strategy and anything interesting that I cannot be bothered with I buy common. When I buy calls I go heavy. For example look at my calls for my latest DD:

In this current environment with stimulus pending it pays to be aggressive. Dance till music stops.

I like to publish my DDs because people can have a constructive discussion about it. For those of you who want to see the type of DD I do here is what I did for my current bet:

=========================

This company is a deep value company left for the dead, but analysts are slowly waking up to the idea. It‚Äôs a reopening play. It is the most similar stock/company to GameSt0p. It is very cheap. It‚Äôs new expansion in Europe is not priced in. Collectors are going nuts over Pops due to stay at home. Prices for Pops are increasing. It is becoming the new beanie baby fad. Downside is limited but the upside is massive.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uehl8sijewf61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=d170fea17a5549d00bc6ad0f30e6556fe1780f46

**Sales trends have reversed and going up:** It saw a sharp drop in demand about a year ago. Hence the price dropped in anticipation of low demand. But that trend was temporary as you can see in google trends graph demand is back. So now it‚Äôs a cheap deep value stock that is poised to make a comeback. It‚Äôs cheap with lots of upside potential. At all time high it was $29.08. When it was selling less pops it was more expensive. Analysts haven‚Äôt realized that this company's sale trends have reversed. The price is suppressed due to being lumped into mall/retail business but this company pivoted hard to ecommerce.

**Collectibles are back:** We saw the price of Pokemon cards, Silver, used games, and collectible stamps go up during pandemic. The stock price for GameSt0p, Collectors Universe, et st has gone up. This company has all the same characteristics but because it‚Äôs a smaller company no one really woke up to its potential.

**Ecommerce expansion in Europe:** European payment processors are reporting high transaction volume in regards to this company. This made me clue in to the increased demand driven by e-commerce. Most analysts are using USA data but the is missing a major part of the expansion plans that this company set in motion in 2019 and became fruitful in the second half of 2020.

**Reopening stocks are poised to outperform**: If you are not interested in any other thesis about the company a simple sector rotation is the only reason many need to buy this retailer. Will the malls open in 3-4 month? Yes. So this will jump back up to its previous levels just by the virtue of that fact.

**Great collaborations:** Need I say more? Disney has been killing it and their pops are produced by this company. The following is from their website:

**New Fad of collecting Pops: (This is the new Beanie Babies)** A world record was set just recently for collecting Pops. You just have to do a simple YouuTube search. It's nuts. The most impressive is that 1.7 million people viewed the video. This brings attention to the hobby of collecting pops and people who were buying little have started buying more. Prices for out of production lots have started going up.

**Clear uptick in demand.** These are trends on google shops: nuts!

**Analysts are waking up to the trend:** This company had a sell/hold rating just last month. Look what‚Äôs happening. Now it has a Strong buy/Buy rating. The price is going to reflect this soon.

&#x200B;

**GameSt0p Similarities:** GameSt0p sells Pops and have full shelves dedicated to this. People are going to go to GameSt0p more and Pop sales will benefit from increased foot traffic. Buying this stock now is like buying GameSt0p when it was below $5. Profits are made before the run up starts. The run up on the stock is starting now. It has taken the first step of it‚Äôs spirit to new all time highs. This company is the most similar company and stock to GameSt0p.",2021-02-07 04:18:35

All of this market manipulation from HF's over the past week may have just been what digs their grave deeper ‚õè,77,le3264,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le3264/all_of_this_market_manipulation_from_hfs_over_the/,30,1612663676.0,"Most people keeping up with the GME & AMC charts this week will have noticed or seen posts about the blatant correlation between them on the graphs, I saw a few posts yesterday in particular.

At this point it's pretty clear that there's not much organic movement going on when you notice how the spikes and dips were almost moving in unison

If it's an orchestrated or algorithmic trend that's being injected as a scare tactic to increase the volume of panic sellers, it probably started out as a great little idea. Bravo hedgies! üëè Probably treated themselves to a round of Don Perignon and a circle jerk after coming up with it.

But now that the week's shaken out and the prices are at a fairly low point compared to how the week started, it's probably time they realised how much of a short-sighted double edged sword they actually threw into the mix .

The psychological games would have no doubt worked on masses of paper handed bandwagon jumpers who bought 3 shares because their buddy gave them a Trading212 referral code and told them it was guaranteed money by Thursday. 

But that being said, with the Yin & Yang of how the stock market is. The consequences of them artifically dropping the price and scaring all of the flies with 3-6 shares a piece, is that they're just attracting the hornets who've analysed technical data for months/years and have amassed a decent amount of money in their portfolio to throw at the cause. 

The type of people that are holding at this point are the one's who see the bigger picture and are generally keeping an eye on volume/float etc.

And they're no doubt gonna want to capitalize on their chance to buy a dip and drop their average, not to mention the mentality shown across the board on this subreddit that says ""Every share we buy is a big fuck you"", to their chances of clawing back on this hefty bit of interest they're starting to accrue.

Like holy shit this last week has been amazing. But the accompanying stories have ruined my loss boner, so it‚Äôs time to address this. 

There have been increasing posts of people pouring their life savings into GME and other meme stocks, hopping on the hype train hoping to make a buck. This is an absolutely terrible idea. **You should absolutely never invest money you cannot afford to lose.** And if you made some money, take out your initial investment and play with the gains, it‚Äôs free money after all.

Us OG‚Äôs want to see you make money. That‚Äôs what the sub is about. We want to see people take stupid fucking risks, but not lose their livelihood doing it. Please also remember to do your own DD. Or at the very least, click on some of the links people put in their DD and try and understand how they reached that conclusion.

Next, recognize what a *‚Äùpump & dump‚Äù* scheme is. We‚Äôve seen a lot of them come through this sub in the past, so we know what to watch out for. Many new folks however, aren‚Äôt familiar with any of that. If you see someone try to hype up a security, do research into it before you buy. If there‚Äôs no new news out or they‚Äôre a tiny company, absolutely **DO NOT** get involved. You will get burned. 

Finally, it‚Äôs okay to take profits. You never lose when you‚Äôre up and cash out, you‚Äôre just securing those gains. It‚Äôs also okay to take the loss and reinvest in something else. There are no rules dictating you have to make that money back in that same stock.

And remember this saying: *‚ÄùBulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù*

Don‚Äôt be a pig. Don‚Äôt get greedy. 

Welcome to the casino. Stay a while. But remember to check out some other tables/machines. Don‚Äôt go all in on craps when you don‚Äôt know how to play craps.

Believing the stock would logically go up after the weekend and that you wouldnt just have a giant sell off immediately on Monday. Obviously, this didnt happen. The people who claimed to hold were simply manipulating the market in their own right, so the stock price would go up and then they would mass sell. This is, legally, fine since they said its not financial advice and used a meme to hide it, but is also pretty much pump and dumping without outright being able to be charged with it. As the stock dropped, i sold, and you know what, it prevented me from being $700 in the hole because i saw the writing on the wall. Right now im only $200 in the hole now. There was no hedgefund short ladder attack or whatever. It was redditors selling, simple as that. 

Truth is, the ""diamond hands"" thing was market manipulation, by reddit, to drive the price up of a stock so those that bought it cheaper can sell, they got their money, while most of you got your dick in your hand and the feeling that you ""held the line"". Looking back on it it was obvious this was gonna happen and although this a meme sub, i am not gonna feel bad if DFV gets dragged through the legal ringer since he encouraged so many people to hold while claiming it was gonna hurt hedgefunds and be a political thing when both of those were an absolute lie. He deserves whatever comes to him, unjustly or not.  

Wallstreet i doubt even got hurt by this either. Yeah they lost $70 billion dollars in two days, but they still are gonna get bailed out by the government, and mark my words, the hedgefunds that were hurt by this arent gonna be hurting next year. They will be back because they are run by multi-billionaires with 40+ years of influence and experience in this stuff. It was a rough year, but not a bad one. 

What my opinions are on GME. If gamestop becomes the next netflix for gaming, then thats the only way i can see any of us getting our money back. I hope for some of you that were tricked into buying GME during the hype that this happens so you can get your money back. I have 3 shares left i plan to hold in case this happens but im not holding my breath on it. It could be years tell that happens. 

Long story short, we got played, hard, and now its time to just wait and see if the new people gamestop has on board is able to rocket the company back to over $200 a share. Its possible imo. Also what i was able to get out of this is to play the stock market smart and never bend into FOMO. Hedgefunds cant be hurt economically and this is proof. They rule the money.",2021-02-07 03:56:27

**So let's tell them what it would take for them to increase revenue.** 

1. Used games should be slightly more than Ebay / Amazon Used. Going to get the game you want off the shelf has value and none of us care about the extra $5-$10.

2. USED GAMES - why the fuck aren't you doing this? Partner with stadia and rent games. Tons of MMO's and stuff I never touch bc I hate buying games and regretting it. 

3. DEALS - Selling 2 properly priced used games to get me in the store to pre-order a game is smart. SELL ME ON THE value. 

4. Website - your website has been the same for years. I used to go to it for upcoming releases. Provide good lists and recommendations. TRAFFIC.

5. Incentivise Employee - I've never seen a salary worker ""work hard"" without an incentive. Give them things to do and reward them. Stop asking me for a warranty on my games. Know who did that? RADIOSHACK, look where they are.....

6. Imagine if gamestop was the only place that wasn't getting hit with bots when selling the PS5. Walmart is bc they don't care. but just imagine how much more business they get.

The sum of all the unrealized losses here easily is in the millions, and I'm sure legit researchers could use some funds.

This seems to be a much safer play to do good instead of hoping that some hedge funds are ""bleeding"" through interest rates.

"PLEASE READ: I work at Fidelity Investments in the Margin Department... Horror Stories of the shitshow that is Robinhood, told by someone who is reviewing & processing your ACATs - PART 1",12891,lec568,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lec568/please_read_i_work_at_fidelity_investments_in_the/,1616,1612690241.0,"So, I'll start this by saying: Yes, if you look at my post history I mostly just openly troll you autists.  I've made fun of the conspiracy theories (mostly bc 99% of you don't understand the importance of market integrity) and I've openly mocked the simps who joined WSB so they could be ""join the revolution"".  I'm OG WSB... this sub was about autistic YOLO plays that made no sense, coming up w/ retarded strategies, bragging about tendies, and telling people to long $ROPE when they blew their accounts up and cried about it.  I'm the WSB equivalent of an old guy yelling at you kids to get off my lawn.

***\*\*\*\*\*HOWEVER\*\*\*\*\*,*** the things I've seen over the past week as Fidelity is forced to restrict brand new accounts (bc of RH), reject perfectly good ACATs  (bc of RH), and watch as clients are shocked to hear the **actual** rules behind trading that the ENTIRE REST OF THE INDUSTRY USES are **100% lawsuit worthy.**  

In the interest of time, ease of reading, and the desire to answer questions I will break these up into multiple parts.  

*Feel free to AMA in comments and I will respond as best I can. Assuming people find this helpful, part 2 will be coming soon.  If this post just ends up deleted by the bot then /shrug at least I posted it.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part #1: Securities purchased using margin in RH accounts when the client had cash available to cover the position.**So, RH is one of the only (the only?) firm where you just get margin as a part of opening your account.  Now, when I say margin I mean the thing that allows you to buy more stonks than you have funds in the account.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Please note:** Having margin *ON* an account is different than having a *MARGIN ACCOUNT.* A margin account simply means that you have the ability to have the proceeds available for trade immediately after placing a sale.  Not all securities are marginable, which is why some securities (like GME the other week) required that you wait for the trade to settle before those funds became available to trade again).  Having margin *ON* an account, means your brokerage firm is giving you a line of credit through which you can purchase more stonks than you have the cash to cover (they charge you interest for this and this is how you can be margin called simply by holding stonks that you paid for).  Having margin *ON* an account ALSO means that, unless you sold the stonk within a few days of the initial purchase, you pay interest for using their money to buy/hold said stonk.

FIDELITY ACCOUNTS REQUIRE THAT YOU FILL OUT A MARGIN AGREEMENT in order to have margin ON your account.  As such, when a security that has been purchased on margin hits an account without margin (like a freshly opened Fidelity account) the new account is restricted, the ACAT potentially rejected, and/or the client immediately is faced with a margin call at Fidelity.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU:** Check your RH accounts!  If your positions show as being held in margin when you have cash available there is a good chance that Robinhood (rather than using the available cash to facilitate your securities purchase) instead purchased using the margin on the account.  In many cases, we are seeing clients who are looking back and realizing they've been being charged margin interest without realizing it.  THIS IS NOT LEGAL.  If you have the cash available in your account to purchase a security, unless you specifically state otherwise, Robinhood is required to use your available cash FIRST.

**IS THIS HAPPENING TO EVERYONE?** No.  It seems to be sporadic but roughly 50% of the over 1m new accounts that Fidelity opened last week have had margin related restrictions slapped on them because of this issue.  However, one person we talked to had to close his bank account (at one of the big three banks) because, after transferring his Robinhood account, they started DEBITING HIS BANK ACCOUNT because they claimed he owed them margin interest.

**MORALE OF THIS STORY: Review your account and make sure that your stonks and options (when applicable) are being held IN CASH if you know you had the cash available to purchase the position.**  Review how much cash is in your RH account.  If RH says you are holding positions in margin and yet you have cash available to cover those positions then IMMEDIATELY contact Robinhood and insist that your positions be converted to CASH POSITIONS.  This does not require you to sell your positions.

Review your statements, trade confirmations, and account to see if you have been charged margin interest.  If you used $10k in cash to buy $9.5k in GME stock, then you **should not** see any margin interest charges.  If you used $10k in cash + $5k in margin buying power to buy $15k of GME stock, then seeing interest charges makes sense.

He has more balls than I do. That being said, my advice here is for all the rest of the  GME  ‚úãüíéüíé‚úã. Basically you have an end point coming soon, so you need to plan accordingly. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. But just to give you a heads up.

DFV has half of his position in GME as call options expiring in April. 

DFV has two options. 1. Sell those call options before expiration. 2 Rollover said options.

 If he chooses one, which will most likely happen anywhere from now till March he'll be good. If he waits for April, those options will be destroyed by time decay and be worthless at expiration. So if I had to guess mid March if he chooses to act the latest.

 Now if he chooses number two, that would be fucking insane. Why would you rollover, which will guarantee you losing money when you are so far ahead.

What you do with this info/thoughts is up to you, just plan accordingly. 

Good luck ‚úãüíéüíé‚úã",2021-02-07 09:01:45
Definitive Guide: New Members and the Market,7,le6uos,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6uos/definitive_guide_new_members_and_the_market/,1,1612674428.0,"So you jumped in on $GME and now you wanna try your hand at the market. Alright, I‚Äôll help so you don‚Äôt start bitching in the comments about someone‚Äôs DD after 4 days of trading. 

**Rule #1:** The first one‚Äôs always free. Did you jump in brand-new and win big on GME? Good for you, but realize, you don‚Äôt know shit about shit, and you should be grateful that you made that money, now don‚Äôt go losing it on a fucking BioTech YOLO because you think you understand how the market works. Ignorant confidence will get you burnt in the long-run. 

**Rule #2:** LEARN HOW TO DO YOUR OWN DD, JESUS CHRIST. Did ‚Äúpussyslayer420‚Äù just make a 6 paragraph post about $ROPE? Did you read it and understand maybe 20% of the words and throw money in because the comments enforced that mentality? Well, let‚Äôs fucking hope not, but if you did, good job, you‚Äôre at least retarded and belong here. Now, watch like the first 7 minutes of [this video](https://youtu.be/eUrycMEVZ7Y) and you should start to at least slightly understand how to research the financials of a company. After those 7 minutes, [READ THIS ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/due-diligence.asp), and if you ever see anyone shit talk Investopedia, tell them to fuck off. 

**Rule #3:** How you should be using your money. Who am I to tell you how you should use your own money? Well I can tell you this, ***I‚Äôm not a licensed professional and none of this is financial advice, just my personal opinion.*** Now that I‚Äôm not legally fucked for giving my opinion, let‚Äôs continue. 

Only use money that you‚Äôre okay with losing. Pay your bills, buy groceries, and take care of your debt. 

Next, taking profits isn‚Äôt a sin. See the BIG FUCKING GME GAIN POSTS? These are the people who saw money laying there for free and said ‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll take that money.‚Äù, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, GME hasn‚Äôt been squoze it seems, so she still has the potential to rocket into the stratosphere. But, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with leaving a trade when you‚Äôre comfortable with a gain/loss. You can even sell enough to get your initial investment back and let the rest ride if you‚Äôre bullish. But at the same time, I got murdered when I started trading because I was a paper-handed bitch. Go with like, stone hands, difficult to break, but realistically they can be broken and sometimes need to be broken. 

**Rule #4:** DONT FOMO YOU RETARD! If you say ‚ÄúAm I too late to the party?‚Äù You probably are. You MIGHT not be, but, you probably are. Best chances if you‚Äôre FOMO‚Äôing to get in, ride the wave for a slight while longer, sell out, and then never look back. Which leads us into ‚ÄúNEVER LOOKING BACK‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a bad idea most of the time, I bought into $NIO at $18, and sold at $21. I was happy with my gains at the time, and I didn‚Äôt look back; until it was inevitable and I saw people talking about the rocket, yeah it was fucking depressing. That‚Äôs why I recommend you don‚Äôt look back, it‚Äôll just make you angry, or depressed, or feel like a retard (that‚Äôs where I was), and it‚Äôll fuck up your mood. If you made money, don‚Äôt look back, keep it schmoovin. Now finally. 

**Rule #5:** Treat it like a business. If you‚Äôre trading as a fun hobby, you likely won‚Äôt have the motivation or commitment needed to keep learning and stay strong when you go tits up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, is the market fun? Sometimes, fuck yeah it‚Äôs fun, other times, it‚Äôll make you walk down the street yelling into a flip phone like some angry wallstreeter whose wife hasn‚Äôt fucked him since the new boyfriend moved in. It CAN be a hobby, but it‚Äôs a hobby that requires a lot of time and effort to be put into it and you don‚Äôt get a weekly paycheck. It‚Äôs more like a shitty business, you‚Äôve got taxes, expenses, losses, risk, stress, uncertainty; but with enough time and dedication to LEARN and CONTINUE LEARNING (the market changes everyday) it will start to become a PROFITABLE business. 

For those of you who plan on staying, this sub is a great time. We insult each other, we waste money for the meme, and we love coming here everyday. 

But just understand, when you see someone say something like ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt go tits up!‚Äù or ‚ÄúDD too long, I‚Äôm buying‚Äù just know, it‚Äôs likely a joke, or just a bad idea.

Anyway nerds, thanks for coming to my TED talk.",2021-02-07 07:07:08
New people (and experienced).. GME is over.

Honestly, you could‚Äôve gotten very rich and made huge gains.. BEFORE it spiked. Everyone who was smart enough has cashed out their big returns, and if they‚Äôre holding anything at all, it‚Äôs a few shares they don‚Äôt mind losing.

It was really interesting to see the kind of power a community like this is capable of. That being said, this ‚Äúfight‚Äù is pretty much done. Sure, billionaires lost money, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it dropped low enough for them to recover a lot of it. (Which is why robinhood is letting you buy more, duh.)

So, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I can‚Äôt predict the future... but I can give you some sound advice: if you‚Äôre going to dump all your life savings into GME right now, expecting to get rich.. you‚Äôre playing a VERY risky game, and you might lose it all. Want to hold GME? Sure, do it. But do it with money you don‚Äôt mind losing.

Edit: Just to be clear. I‚Äôm not hating on GME or telling anyone what to do. It‚Äôs friendly advice. I feel like some people didn‚Äôt bother reading past the title so I‚Äôll 
TLDR: 
If you want to buy GME, be smart about it. Will it go up, down? Who knows. All we know is it‚Äôs definitely not the same situation it was 2 weeks ago, so the chances of you losing your investment are higher.. therefore, ‚Äúinvest‚Äù, don‚Äôt ‚Äúdump all your money and hope for the best‚Äù.",2021-02-07 02:17:40

CHECK YOUR ACOUNT STATUS NOW - SHADY BROKERS,362,lel3zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lel3zx/check_your_acount_status_now_shady_brokers/,62,1612727616.0,"Many brokers have sneakily converted your cash accounts into margin accounts in order to loan your shares to shorts.

If we all convert back to cash it will force the brokers to call in the shares and the shorts will have to purchase new shares to cover the outstanding. 

This could well cause another squeeze of unimaginable squeezyness if enough people are able to do it before the 9th.


Copied from /u/pandaemonium 

""Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?""

Yes.Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.

Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.

If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).

Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.

edit: /u/rozhasi says ""Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can‚Äôt lend your shares to short sellers.""

edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though new Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into.

edit3: from /u/brewlee. In DEGIRO you can check it by clicking ladder in top left corner, then triangle right to your name, then its second position from top. You can check your account status there. If it's not custody, I am sorry, you pay for the hedge's. The account at DEGIRO is unchegable. You have to make new account and transfer funds

Think of all that it takes to run thousands of servers in the cloud.. the infrastructure is enormously complicated and there are tens of thousands of servers constantly switching tasks based on demand. Tech has developed cloud deployment and management tools like Kubernetes running Docker and the like. This field is called DevOps and it‚Äôs the playground of DevOps engineers. 

Now what if you want to automate as much as possible these incredibly complicated systems? How do you monitor diagnose and alert based on problems you may not even know exist? Can you build automated repair and optimization systems that go beyond the basic building block implementation? 

Enter Dynatrace, which is solving these problems with AI. They have AI anomaly detection, AI automated cloud management, and AI driven optimization.  

The potential for AI in the space is incredible and Dynatrace has only begun to capture market share. They are lightyears ahead of traditional DevOps tooling. 

They recently had a great quarterly report and have broken out of their trading range. A host of analysts have upgraded in recent earnings. As the market realizes their potential I believe there is massive upside especially in this tech bubble.

My thoughts on firearms and ammunition companies as an investment strategy,19,le0fm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le0fm5/my_thoughts_on_firearms_and_ammunition_companies/,53,1612656176.0,"Good morning assholes.   


I see a lot of people in firearms-adjacent jobs and lifestyles talking up buying stock in gun and ammo manufacturing. I'm not, because I think it's a trap. And not because of any apocalyptic predictions, either. Hear me out.   


Manufacturing both firearms and ammunition requires a substantial investment to set up for, in terms of time and capital. Additionally, these companies can't get support in the form of loans from \*most\* banks because of being reclassified recently as ""high risk"" for money laundering. I don't agree with this, but what's right and what is real don't always intersect perfectly.   


Because of the temporary nature of the surge in demand, I believe that companies such as Fiocchi and one or two others which have recently added production floor space, \*only\* did so because they were already planning to do so for some time now. So far as I know, there have been no reactive expansions of production as a result of 2020's state of non-stop panic.   


Because after the hype settles down, ultimately, demand will eventually return to normal, most likely way too early for any expansion in production capabilities to lead to an increase in market share or saturation.   


A FEW POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS:  
1. 2020 saw an unprecedented number of new gun owners. Won't that cause an increased long-term demand for ammunition?  
\-Probably not. My feel for the climate right now is that most of those firearms will end up rotting in a safe or getting resold secondhand for cheap and no longer contributing to a consistent demand. This surge in new owners is likely a major contributing factor to the current shortage. Once they all have the requisite one or two boxes that their gun-owner friend recommended they grab, that's probably it for them. That's still MILLIONS of boxes of ammunition, but unlikely to contribute anything in terms of long-term repeating purchases for the majority of new owners.   
2. What if new legislation is enacted?  
\-Then manufacturers will probably pivot toward compliant manufacturing and designs, much like what happened during the last AWB. Demand will surge for a short period and then drop slightly. Puts or shorts may be a better option than stocks or calls if you expect this to happen.  
3. What if nothing happens and things go back to normal?   
\-Then the price of stock should do about the same.   


TL;DR -   


Just because demand appears huge now doesn't necessarily mean there's much in the way of money to be made. A lot of the apparent surge in demand comes from a number of factors that make things look way worse than they really are, and none of these things is likely to last past the next year or two.  


I think buying an actual M1 Garand might be a better investment strategy, seeing as how they never actually seem to get any cheaper.",2021-02-07 02:02:56

As we're the currencies of many other countries since that time.

Central banks have just been printing more fiat currency since then. Using debt to pay down debt, and needing more debt each time to pay off previous debt. It's a giant Ponzi scheme. 
This is devaluing the money at an astonishing rate, nothing is really getting more expensive, it's just our money and wages are continually being devalued.

But all fiat currency goes to zero value at some point. As it always has throughout history. 
I think the hyperinflationary debt crisis is coming soon. Just like Weimar republic Germany where they needed a ""wheelbarrow"" full of money to buy a loaf of bread.

Fake money can't go on forever.  And this time its global, because the world reserve currency is the USD which is backed by nothing.  China and Russia probably know this and that's why they're buying and hoarding gold.

Im sure this is what the whole ""great reset"" is that the world economic forum keeps talking about. Surely anyone who understands a few basic fundamentals about money and history would know this whole Ponzi scheme is going to blow up at some point.",2021-02-07 01:42:56

I don't really know what to do about that, but I'm clearly not a bot and if you can think of a way for me to prove I'm not a shill, I'm all ears.

Second, as some of you know because you've complained about it every time I do it, I've been posting a help message into the big threads on this subreddit, telling people that they can reach out and that they're not alone. I've received messages from over 500 people in the last 4 days, and they're all just happy to have someone to talk to, and to listen to them. Some of them only have a share or two of GME or a few dozen AMC, and some people bought in for over $100,000. 

Almost all of them are selling, or have already sold, and absolutely none of them are buying more. I would estimate, conservatively, that 4 out of 5 people who message me have already sold, and half of the ones who haven't tell me that they're going to ASAP.

The money I put into my meme stocks, I am just going ti consider a total loss, and if it goes up at all, GREAT!!! If not, ok, I already consider it a loss.  In the mean time I have learned some valuable lessons and I learned a ton about the stock market, corruption, news/media and how it is controlled, and emotional investing.

This was a great experience and I am better because of it.  

My plan, at this point, is to hold what I have and diversify from here on out.

They have the DBX suv coming out, which I think will be a big money maker once they can get the production line started which will help.
They are getting back into F1 which could help their price depending on how they do. 
They have brought on some big names from Mercedes-AMG to help run things.
Short version: I think this one is going to go up quite a bit in the next year or so.
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",2021-02-07 01:33:31

Manage your hedge fund, with your yes men. Take your allowance from Daddy, and invest in. Take the ethics of business, shame and molest them. Contribute to inequality, harm the people, stress them.

More effective than an RH shutdown. When the corrupt mods got washed out & drowned, all the decent Redditors congregated, gathered around. Some sacrificed their presence here: martyrs vs. entitled clowns. Ironic sub, for selflessness, to take the champion's crown, at the end of the war, when the cavalry came to town.

Hope you enjoy your movie deals, and ego-driven feels. Credit with others as a human just rotted, and congealed. Your last bet is having enough cash to cover your back-stabbing ass, for real. How long did you think your conspiracy would remain concealed? The fat lady didn't just sing for you, she squealed.

This is a good day. I have to grin, and nod. All the effort, and intelligence, that countered these self-absorbed mods... I've learned more about stocks, which were confusing, and odd, on here for 30 minutes than a class back in Aug...

I'm not here as a subscriber to get rich. I'm here because this sub has integrity, and grit. People like that? I'd like to align myself with. Learn from, and honor, while we all co-exist.

I'm a penniless artist, and this is my art. The toxicity you guys beat has moved my entire heart. The poor aren't stupid. They're resourceful, and smart. That's why Wall Street had to take back their shopping cart. We damn-near walked away with it. We went THAT hard...

CEO's aren't impressive to me. One Redditor helped this sub exist, for FREE. Blew the whistle, when the vultures returned, to feed. Their return to this sub, something we need!

So to anyone involved...to anyone who had the decency to make sure this problem was solved: This world can be awful, and some think it revolves...around their egos, colossal, even though they lack balls, backbone, or competence. Quivering lips on their jaws. Subscribed this sub, because it proved to the WORLD, that Wall Street: It's flawed.

The pampered and wealthy, so shocked, in awe. Here's a salute to you all! May their hierarchy fall...

DD - Back to Business,40,ldyytx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldyytx/dd_back_to_business/,38,1612651611.0,"
Last week companies like PLTR are back up and trending in the right direction. (I do hold PLTR) I think the EV stocks are about to do the same again as this other sideshow levels out.

Company - Quantumscape - QS  

Product - a lighter, more efficient battery for EV's. Charges faster than a Tesla battery. Protected with Patents so this is not common technology. Gets about 85% charge in 15 mins which is amazing.

Virtually No Debt. The biggest liability on their last Nov Balance sheet was deferred underwriting expenses. 

Volkswagen owns 20% of the company so there is a big potential customer with skin in the game and who can offer vehicle manufacturer feedback and input. They paid $300M for this so its not a gimme to get a good partner. One of their Execs sits in the board.

Bill Gates is also an investor - like him or hate him dude is smart.

After the big GM and Ford announcements this EV thing is real now. Its not just a Tesla thing or the odd product out of the majors. Big money is being put towards product development. This could be an argument for jus going to buy Tesla but its an expensive stock and has the good already priced in. So trying to find others is the challenge. These guys don't have the issues a manufacturer of cars does. Battery technology will have uses outside of vehicles. So that's why I like this component.

Quantumscapes battery is not a full Lithium battery. They are solid state Lithium. Lithium isn't great for the environment but it is the future of batteries so smaller and more efficient is a bonus.

Downside: this is not in major production right now. Its a great technology but is not actively in vehicles. Read: No sales.

The recent sell off was probably due to over excitement and the insiders sold shares after the lock up. However the remaining 95% of insider and employee shares are locked up.

This is not likely a moon shot tomorrow as these things take a while to fully develop but the SPAC gave them a piss pot of cash for R&D.

Next earnings release is Feb 16. If you are feeling good, you can get in before then. If you want to be conservative, wait until this is public. I don't expect there to be any sales. This will be an update on the battery technology and if they have taken on any debt. The last release was a $0.20 loss per share. This is not an all in share and should only be considered if you have some spec space in your account. 

Do your own homework. Check out the company's web page, read some articles. See if the difference in the solid state battery technology versus Lithium Ion makes sense. Forbes has a negative article on the company but its all based on valuation from companies who are not emerging. 

My brokerage firm shows 6.34% short interest. I will look at that as positive for the direction and not a positive in anticipation of a squeeze.

However, January/February is historically the slowest travel period of the year. Stock prices for airlines and hotel services are already low due to:

(COVID-19 travel restrictions) + (Low Travel Time of Year) = Low Share Price

***HOWEVER*** Please know that some airlines and hotel services took on A TON of debt that will take a long time to recover from. Others relied on large cash reserves to make it through the pandemic and took on minimal debt.

The ones that borrowed the least amount of money from the government over the pandemic will be the ones with the largest and quickest bounce back when this summer's travel season hits with lifted COVID travel restrictions and the urge for people to want to get out of the house.

Minimal debt will make it easier for these well-off travel companies to be able to meet the sudden increase in demand this summer and get themselves back to pre-covid financial stability relatively quick.

The ones that accrued a ton of loan-debt will be the ones that you won't see much gain from for *YEARS* as cash reserves are *slowly* built back up.

***The Main Point***: If you are interested in investing in travel companies during the current off-season of travel, ***DO YOUR RESEARCH*** to find the ones that have the strongest financial strong-hold when the travel season hits.

Take a walk, watch a movie. Maybe try recouping your losses with index investing, or something safer to get your mind off the market.

Posting on my alt, since a few people know my legit account and between money and mental health issues, it's just easier to avoid. 

But I've lurked for at least 4 years, but hadn't post in a while. 

So, here I am, divorced 2 years, young kid, awful depression & very suicidal, seeing a shrink twice a week who threatened to institutionalize me, and I'm newly medicated. (So I'm in bad shape, but doing what I need to for help) 

My start up was already hurting, and tanked from covid, ex is trying to take kid to far away land. Dwindling savings which means I need a shitty, damned near free lawyer to not lose my kid. Late December get a letter from previous employer that they are gonna mess with a 401k l didn't move. Decide to move it. Due to a bunch of paperwork issues it took a while for the account to be funded. 

18.5k mostly yoloed into GME options while half drunk on the couch of the woman I've been with on again off again since divorced. Knew how stupid this was because was a broker in 2008 when everything went to shit. I know enough to be dangerous, but in many ways clueless. Never actually did an option before. 

What have got to lose? I mean I'm literally shopping for drugs to off myself every few nights. (Nembutal is realy hard to find) Ex gets 2nd interview in far away land. If lose my kid I'm 100% fucked mentally. Day after she tells me this account hits 100k. Was in bed with my quasi-girlfriend, and she saw the intraday high as double her annual salary. 

Feeling weird anxiety all weekend. Wednesday account hits 250k, decide to take the options off the table and keep the majority of shares since this is enough for me to live at least 2 years and still have lawyer money. So, maybe this shit saved me from myself.


A bit of an epilogue:  took out a chunk, got a good lawyer, lawyer said there is little chance for me to lose my kid, and I'm in good shape.

I saw something then I heard more and it that got me thinking and wanted some thoughts on it. With a huge wave of coming demand I wanted to look for opportunities in the periphery of EV‚Äôs.

There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don‚Äôt see any companies that are focused on this.

There is an ETF $LIT. I‚Äôm not thrilled with it though.

So my thoughts lead me to EV battery material mining. With shortages this could be a good play but I‚Äôm not sure about long term potential.

With no deadline on the time in which they have to cover their shorts and pay back loans (in the case of melvin 20+% on a 2.3 billion loan) , it‚Äôs a game of chicken. For every day they don‚Äôt cover, they stand to lose a lot of money, and they are BLEEDING. They are using mimetic warfare to get you to lose confidence. This is called psychological (informational) warfare. If you‚Äôre holding, I say do you DD and maybe look at the underlying reasons (the short position) as to why the stock is a good hold. A the end of the day, fuck these bots/shills and fuck the SEC. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Bought in 3.5 shares at 290 and still holding. Diamond hand guys.

Obviously yes, you can infact blame the individual for giving into a sheeple mentality. This is just the norm. 

But different markets come with stricter regulations.  My favorite example is the tobacco industry.  If the rest of the market was under the same scrutiny as the tobacco industry most leaders would be in jail.   Tobacco has limits on how when and where they are allowed to market their products,  they incur heavy fines and penalties at all levels of sales when people outside of their authority abuse the product.   And they're only allowed to earn the specific profit margins set for them by tax laws and min max price regulations.

This isnt a lobby for relaxed tobacco laws,  just my own realization of how fortunate we are to still be in a freeish market.  And how careful we all have to be to not fall victim to the big corps when they tell us were wrong.",2021-02-07 03:29:37

GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,57106,le235t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/,5051,1612660942.0,"DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
   
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)‚Äîor 125% (25 √∑ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

$RIDE or die,20,le1s8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1s8b/ride_or_die/,7,1612660040.0,"  

Listen up, I‚Äôm about to hand you undeserving miscreants a 5-bagger, maybe 10, just by buying and holding.

[Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/) ($RIDE), makers of the [Endurance](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance), the only EV truck with four independent, hub-mounted motors.

**The Company** 

Lordstown Motors is named after Lordstown, Ohio, site of a giant [mothballed GM factory](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/gms-lordstown-factory-goes-dark-as-automaker-closes-underused-plants.html). The factory spit out 16 million cars and trucks before being shut down two years ago. Car manufacturing was what Lordstown was built around, but people stopped buying sedans, and this factory only made the Chevy Cruze. You know anyone who drives a Cruze? Exactly. No one. That‚Äôs why they shut down.

But you know what people want? TRUCKS. You know what else people are buying? Electric vehicles. Too bad there are only those ridiculously ugly Cybertrucks that will someday, maybe, eventually, get built and sold at ridiculous prices. Too bad there‚Äôs only that hydrogen one that runs on MS Paint and vaporware. Too bad the other EVs are Chinese, so when you retards lick the windows, you get cancer.

Meanwhile, there are entire fleets of commercial vehicles looking for something to fill their needs. And you know who knows how to build all of that? A bunch of fucking unemployed people in Lordstown, Ohio! Enter RIDE. They made a deal with GM to buy the plant and get prototypes for fleet vehicles rolling off the line within a year. 

**The Truck**

My God, look at this beautiful beast. Look at those sexy headlamps. Look at those MFing solenoid coils in the wheel wells. Those taillights look like Cyclops and Geordi La Forge had an LED love child. Wanna touch it. Makes me hard.

75 MPGe. 7,000 lb towing capacity. 1.5 ton payload. 250 mile range. 109 kWh battery pack. Unnnggghh. Read it to me again, but slower. Aaahhh yeah.

Most important differentiator? The hub motors. They‚Äôre directly on the wheel, so there‚Äôs no transmission devices of any sort, so no wasted motion, no wasted energy. They‚Äôre designed specifically for the type of stop-start driving that fleet vehicles do. Think package delivery. And because they‚Äôre independent motors, they can individually deliver power, allowing true 4WD on muddy job sites, not the actually-its-just-2-axle design.

OK class, can anyone name a group of [aging delivery vehicles that might need to be replaced real soon](https://www.wired.com/story/biden-wants-government-run-evs-not-easy/)? Preferably from [an American manufacturer](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/)? Can you say ‚Äú[regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)‚Äù? I know you can!

Who‚Äôs making the parts, you ask? GM. RIDE has full access to the GM catalogue of parts, so the company can just copy and paste the behind-the-dashboard stuff with confidence that it‚Äôll work, that suppliers will come through, that costs will be reasonable due to bulk production in other GM vehicles, and most importantly, that the company doesn‚Äôt need to pay for the R&D. It‚Äôs already been done. RIDE is reinventing the wheel, but the rest of the truck is taken care of. Like your wife, it‚Äôs got that label on the outside, but it‚Äôs really someone else‚Äôs junk in her.

Who‚Äôs making the batteries, though? Samsung. Nuff said. And the motors? [These guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbCuwC_UwE).

**The Money**

Cool truck. Fine. Whatever. Can‚Äôt eat a truck, only tendies. So look at the numbers. The truck will sell for between MSRP of $52500 and an actual price of $45,000. Let‚Äôs take the lesser. It costs, the company estimates, $42k today and $37k by 2024. The plant will ramp up from just a few thousand this year to 100,000 by 2024. From there, the plant can produce 600,000 trucks per year. Dayum! That‚Äôs a lot of product! Isn‚Äôt that way more than anyone could sell? 

No, retard. Look it up. The Ford F150 sells 900,000 trucks every year. The Silverado, about 600k. Nobody‚Äôs buying those boomer dinosaurs. 100k is nothing. It‚Äôs easy, especially when you‚Äôre the most badass EV truck available, and unlike the competitors, you actually exist in real life.

So let‚Äôs pencil in 100k trucks per year, sold at 45k and costing 37k. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs $130 million to run the G&A. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶$726k in profit by 2024, more every year after. Look, I understand most of you just want to SEC (middle word = Elon‚Äôs) all day long, so you don‚Äôt really understand the concept of profit yet, but trust me, it‚Äôs a good thing!

Right now the company has a market cap of $4 billion. It can make ¬æ billion in a year. That‚Äôs a P/E of 5. What‚Äôs Ford‚Äôs PE right now? 10. If RIDE gets to the same PE (and it will go much higher because it‚Äôs not a boomer truck) it‚Äôll double. If RIDE sells as well as the Silverado sells now, the PT is $222 at a minimum. That‚Äôs 10 times today‚Äôs price. In 5-6 years.

You‚Äôre welcome.

A Tale of Two Stocks,9,le1rdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1rdy/a_tale_of_two_stocks/,10,1612659985.0,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.

Thanks to industrialization, large portions of the population were uprooted and were herded together in large centers. This new form of existence, with its mass psychology and social dependence on the fluctuation of markets and wages, produced an individual who was unstable, insecure, and suggestible. He was aware that his life depended on boards of directors and captains of industry, and he supposed, rightly or wrongly, that they were chiefly motivated by financial interests. He knew that, no matter how conscientiously he worked, he could still fall a victim at any moment to economic changes which were utterly beyond his control. And there was nothing else for him to rely on.

The captains of industry, most of them in the United States, chiefly motivated by financial interests, did indeed infect the entire planet with their greedy materialism. One concomitant of such materialism is the spiritual confusion of our modern world. Another has been the hollowing out of money, which in the near future will make all savings illusory. A third is the emptiness of Western materialistic values, which has led to the degeneration of the individual personality. 

Success doesn‚Äôt mean the gaining of wealth, position, or other advantage, implying things like advancement, upward mobility, getting or being rich, having power or status, achieving a prominent social position, or gaining acclaim or a respected reputation in one‚Äôs career. 

The new success is people taking up their individual responsibility, accepting the challenge of personal change, achieving transformation, turning problems into opportunities, moving into their own power, working with those less fortunate, developing visions to inspire and energize others, and challenging the status quo.

When the time is fulfilled a new orientation will irresistibly break through, a thing unheard-of before: the right man sitting in his house and thinking the right thought will be heard 100 miles away. Neither propaganda nor exhibitionist confessions are needed.

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the commission-free stock trading & investing apps are a pretty neat idea.

Everyone üíé ü§ö for $1000 and why we should be hoping for 3:1 x$100 instead,22,le1qyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1qyd/everyone_for_1000_and_why_we_should_be_hoping_for/,35,1612659959.0,"Think about this. Bulls and bears squabbling back and forth. HF‚Äôs dealing with massive potential losses willing to potentially taking legally questionable actions. Retail investors losing big gains and getting tin foil hat sick. GME‚Äôs market cap roller coaster making company moves difficult to plan. 

If GME split shares 3:1, it could solve a lot of the problems for all sides. 

1. Retail investors. Let‚Äôs say you bought in at $300 and now we‚Äôre down to $60. If a split occurred, your share would turn to three valued at $20. Demand surges from HF‚Äôs to help cover their shorts as well as üìÑ ü§ö/new retail investors sending the stock back to $100. Your one share losing $240 is now 3 shares worth your initial investment. Also allows people to average down. For those average share under $300 currently, gains. 

2. HF‚Äôs. If HF‚Äôs are short, they can grab a good chunk of shares to cover ~1/3 of their short position at a discount. The HF‚Äôs shorting at $400 currently would only need new shares to stay under $133 to cover. Stabilizes the beasts by their direct surge in buying the lower value shares to bring value up, positively impacting retail investors. Nothing will change some folk‚Äôs sentiment about HF‚Äôs, but it would be at least a more legal way for them to play their games while not borking the retail investor like they have been. 

3. GME. The roller coaster stock prices/market cap make planning for investments/pivots by the new leadership difficult to calculate. By splitting and seeing a surge to find a common ground, in this scenario, GME‚Äôs market cap would be $21B. A lot for a ‚Äúfailing‚Äù game store (HF thesis for shorting) and to pivot for massive company evolution (bull retail investors/‚ÄúI like the stock‚Äù crowd). 

Ie. I have 100 shares. If it meme‚Äôd out and got to $1000 each, who‚Äôs to say the brokerages could universally (looking at you RH) pay out for people who dip out at $1000?  My 100 shares I bought close to the top ($300 for $30k) would then become 300 shares at $100, bringing me back even on investment but now in possession of a valuable asset I could choose to sell. GME has a stockpile of cash from these adjustments to make major moves in the market. If I hold my now recovered $30k, GME could go up based on new initiatives (especially after all this free publicity). If I don‚Äôt really love the stock, I can get out and get my money back. For those who averaged below $300 a share or hold shares from the before times, you end up with some pretty significant - and stable - gains with 3x as many shares in a company poised for a massive pivot. 

Not a pessimist, üíé ü§ö all the way. But, if I could triple my stake in a company I believe in and see my initial investment get back to close to even, watching GME have the capital to make some gigantic leaps at the expense of the HF‚Äôs fixing their mess by jacking up the new diluted share price, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly be mad. Plus new investors/people finally able to average down would see gains. That looks to me like 3 parties (current holders, GME and new retail investors) winning at the expense of HF‚Äôs fixing their garbage hands while jacking the price for shareholders.",2021-02-07 03:05:59

Someone recently did [a great DD on LULU](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klxhx6/lulu_to_the_moon_and_here_is_why/). I want to add a few things:

\- The stock price has been struggling in the past 3 months (down 5%) but has started an upward trend last week.

\- Q4 earnings coming out on 3/25, and given how busy the stores were during the holidays can bet it's going to be awesome.

\- Currently, the most popular (highest open interest) option for this stock (across all expiration dates and strikes) is 380C 3/19/2021, so it seems smart money is betting on a big move prior to the earnings (although it's possible these positions were opened mid last year when the stock price was higher.)

Otherwise, the average person on here probably wouldve just paid off rent for a year or two? Or two nice vacations from the potential earnings had they sold @ 450$. I quite frankly dont give a fuck about the 5 digit missed profits or unrealized losses, I can make it back in half a year tops if Im lazy. Technically, I didnt lose anything yet as I plan to hold my shares @ average of 40 to the grave or give them to my great great children but you get my point.

It wasnt my first degenerate gamble and the logic and maths were there. It was a once-in-a-lifetime play. What grinds my gears though was when momentum was totally cut off last week and shit started crashing when no one could buy. We were on track to soar but we didn't count on brokers taking a piss. It blows.

I'm OK losing money I was willing to gamble. I have no problem sinking with the ship at this point, but not in an unfair game. Imagine sitting at a blackjack table and the dealer busts just for him to take a card off and say 'Oh yeah, I changed the rules. I unbusted! Hooha!!' What I'm upset about is that they had to bend the rules to beat us. We were on track to hit 1000$ per share had RH and other fuck faces not halted all ability to buy GME. What ever happened to a free market and land of the free?

My second disappointment isnt with the system, its in myself. Many moons ago, I used to work 9$ an hour scanning pineapples and bananas as a kid. Soon after college I worked a construction job for 15$ an hour till I found a more stable job with my college degree. I bought my shares @ 40$, I couldve sold each for 200,300, or even 400 easy. What happened? I got greedy.  Lets be honest with ourselves, most of us did the same shit. Everytime I hit the refresh button I was printing 2K and imagined ruling the world from a yacht in the Hvar with my GME shares. I was too fucking high off benjamin franklins to sell each share for 5-10X what I bought them for that I phoned my broker and set each share at 10,000$.

"The ""Gamma Squeeze"" Explained: Gamma Theory for Monke",1337,le1kor,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/,198,1612659524.0,"Since GME's gamma squeeze 2 weeks ago, every monkey seems to think that GME is primed for another ""gamma squeeze"" every single day. Veteran WSBers almost certainly understand what a gamma squeeze is because a) It's not complicated b) Gamma was all the rage last March as SPY plunged into oblivion...but the 6M monkeys that have flooded into these sacred gates within the last 2 weeks seem to be pretty oblivious. So, I want to help spread some knowledge so our community isn't filled with fucking idiots. **I'm going to try to explain some basic gamma theory, diluted-down so even you peanut-brain baboons can understand.** *You do have to be literate to understand this, so maybe there is no hope for many of you.*

You need to have a basic understanding of *options greeks*, namely delta and gamma. I will briefly discuss them so we're all on the same page, but I'm not going in-depth because there are hundreds of posts in this sub explaining them in-depth, not to mention all the boring bullshit that gets posted in places like r/options.

EDIT: Putting this at the top since apparently many people are confused. **A ""gamma squeeze"" has absolutely nothing to do with a short squeeze**. Gamma squeezes are driven by large numbers of OTM option buying, whereas short squeezes have to do with short hedge funds buying back shares to cover their ass. *A short squeeze can happen without a gamma squeeze, and a gamma squeeze can happen without a short squeeze.*

DISCLAIMER: *I have no idea what I'm talking about. This has nothing to do with my career and I've learned all of this gamma shit from reading tons of shit online. This is not a lot things, and it's definitely not financial advice.  There are probably tens-of-thousands of people in this sub that know way more about this than me, so if I say something incorrect, I will happily edit this to reflect that.*

*If you understand basics options greeks, skip ahead.*

For the following, assume you paid $100 ($1.00 per share) to buy-to-open 1 call contract with strike price $10 (I'll refer to this as $10C). You are now ""long"" this $10C. If you sell an option, you are ""short"" it. Each option contract is worth 100 shares, so you multiply delta/gamma by 100 to get net delta/gamma.

* **Delta**: *For every $1 move in the underlying, your option's price/value will change by delta.*
   * For example: If your delta is 0.25 (or 25, same thing), then the value of your option will increase by $0.25 for each $1 the underlying increase. I.e. Stock goes from $5 to $6, then your $1.00/share call increases to $1.25/share, netting you a profit of $25. Stock goes from $5 to $4, then your call decreases to $0.75/share, netting you a loss of $25.
   * Long calls are positive (+) delta, short calls are negative (-) delta; long puts are (-) delta, short puts are (+) delta. Delta gets larger in magnitude as you go in-the-money (ITM) and smaller as you go out-of-the-money (OTM).
      * At-the-money options (ATM) have a delta of approximately 0.50. The delta of deep ITM options approaches 1.0 as you go further into the money. The delta of deep OTM options approaches 0.0 as you go further out of the money.
* **Gamma:** *For every $1 move in the underlying, your* ***delta*** *will change by* ***gamma.***
   * If you have taken any basic physics course, this will sound like **acceleration** to you...because it basically is. It's the 2nd order derivative of your option's value function.
   * If you have no idea what any of the above means, think about **gamma as the gas pedal in your wife's boyfriend's car**: when he floors the gas pedal, the car goes faster and faster, increasing in speed *exponentially*. Once the car starts moving, it starts picking up speed rapidly because of the acceleration, and you go flying into the back of the trunk as your wife gives her boyfriend a quick handie in the front seat.
   * Long options all have positive (+) gamma, regardless if they're a put or a call; **short options all have negative (-) gamma**. **Gamma is largest at-the-money** (ATM) and decreases as you move both ITM and OTM.
   * For example: Delta is 0.25, gamma is 0.05, underlying price is $7. As price goes from $7 to $8 (approaching your $10 strike), delta increases by gamma to 0.30 and gamma increases to 0.10. As price then goes from $8 to $9, delta increases to 0.40 and gamma increases to 0.15. As price increases from $9 to $10, delta increases to 0.55.

>***As gamma increases, delta grows exponentially***...and gamma increases because you are approaching the strike price. If that makes sense, then you basically understand how a gamma squeeze works.

Now before I explain what a gamma squeeze is, I need you to stop slobbering all over your keyboard- you're an ape, not a dog. Just because your wife's boyfriend disciplines you like a delinquent poodle doesn't make you one. You're a fucking ape, have some pride.

Okay anyway, I want to explain what **market makers** (**MMs**) are because most of you orangutans clearly don't understand them either.

**Market Makers**

>*When you buy an option, another degenerate isn't selling it to you- a market maker is*.

MMs are large banks/institutions that have special agreements with your broker (sometimes they are your broker) to go behind the scenes and fill trades, providing essential liquidity to the market so you can get fills on your faggy delights (FDs). MMs make money by A) getting paid by the broker to create liquidity B) Scraping margins on bid-ask spreads. That doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you're filling millions of spreads those pennies add up fast.

Since MMs will basically take any trade and *make money regardless of how the trade goes*, they want to **hedge the trade so their risk is essentially 0**. To do this, they try to be ""**delta neutral**,"" meaning they want their net delta to be 0. If net delta is 0, when price goes up or down the value of the overall position/strategy doesn't change.

""*Hedging! I've heard a lot of people use that word when talking about gamma!*"" is what you're probably thinking. Congrats, you chimpanzee, you're sort of starting to connect the dots.

**MM hedging is what creates gamma squeezes.**

>*How do MM's hedge options?*

Let's go back to that $10C you bought for $1.00/share (delta 0.25, gamma 0.05). A MM was on the other end of that transaction: they sold-to-open (or ""wrote"") the $10C for $100. Now the **MM is short a $10C**, so they have ***negative delta*** **and** ***negative gamma;*** their net delta is -25 and their net gamma is -5. They want to be delta neutral, so they buy 25 shares of the underlying (every long share has a delta of 1.0) and ~~wallah~~ (edit: I'm stupid) voila! -25 + 25 = 0.

*But, what happens when price increases?* You add gamma to delta. Your delta increases to +30, and the MM's options delta decreases (becomes more negative) to -30 (-25 + -5 = -30).

>*Because MM's have negative gamma, their delta gets larger in size*. ***Negative gamma creates gamma squeezes.***

*Uh oh,* now the MM's net delta is -5 (-30 from the short call, +25 from the long stock)...so they re-hedge by buying 5 more shares bringing their net delta back to 0. That share buying can push price up, leading to a vicious cycle of buying/re-hedging.

**The Gamma Squeeze**!

>Everytime MM's adjust their hedge by buying more shares, that can potentially **further increase the price.** This means delta will increase, and force MM's to **buy even more shares to re-re-hedge**.

*""Gamma"" is in the name, so where does gamma come into play?* As the underlying approaches your strike  price, gamma increases in size. This means that delta increases exponentially. As a result, MM's increase the number of shares they buy each time: first 5 at a time, then 10, then 15 at a time. As price goes up, **MMs buy gamma** **to hedge their short call.** **As gamma gets larger, MMs hedge with more shares.** *Without gamma, the squeeze would fizzle out quickly.*

**The setup:**

>Gamma squeezes don't happen all the time. *You need the proper setup for a stock to get ""gamma squeezed.""* That setup involves **leverage** and **HUUUGE** (like the size of your wife's-boyfriend's-dong big) **AMOUNTS of deep OTM options**, two things every fucker here loves.

Let's say a stock is trading at $15. A few million idiots load up on cheap, deep OTM options at $30 and $50. These are stupid fucking options with deltas of basically 0, so MM's don't need to hedge them *initially*. In most cases, these will expire worthless. For whatever reason, the underlying's price starts picking up speed and starts approaching those strikes.

Now, all of a sudden **those worthless calls have a non-zero delta, and that delta is rapidly increasing by a further-increasing gamma.** All of a sudden, MM's start buying a bunch of shares to hedge and the *rate at which they buy is increasing with gamma*. This is all exacerbated by the fact that these FD's were so dirt cheap that **tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of contracts were purchased** by fucking brainlets.

So let's revisit 2 Friday's ago, January 22nd. GME opened around $40. The most OTM call strike was $60C with an open interest of 35k to start the day. By the end of the day, the volume at that strike was **180,000**. We can't always assume those are all buying-to-open, but looking back I think it's safe to say most of them were probably buying-to-open. Those options were **dirt cheap** at the start of the day because their delta was basically 0. By the end of the day, GME closed around $65 and all those $60C expired ITM, meaning a delta of 1.0.

>**MM's actively hedge during the day as price moves**, so that means they had to keep buying shares as price moved closer and closer to $60. Because of this, **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.

Again, you can't assume that all 180,000 $60C contracts were bought-to-open, but let's be reasonable and say 100,000 were bought-to-open. *That's the equivalent of 10 million shares that were purchased by MM's during the day to hedge their short calls* (total volume for that day was 200M) *- and that's just for the $60C alone*. Thus, this was a textbook gamma squeeze that inevitably helped drive GME's 50% increase in price that day.

**Will the GME Gamma Squeeze repeat:**

>Now that you hopefully understand the basics of a gamma squeeze, I want to re-emphasize one point: *YOU NEED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEEP OTM CALLS FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE.*

Why did we get a gamma squeeze on January 22nd? Because the $60C were **dirt-fucking-cheap** so degenerates could **leverage themselves to the tits with calls.** Thousands of calls could be bought for pennies - these calls are worthless until they're suddenly not, forcing MMs to rapidly hedge and yielding *the glorious gamma squeeze.*

What's different now? Implied volatility (IV) has been record-settingly high on GME options for the past week. Like 700-900%...values that were pretty much unthinkable until this event. That insane IV leads to options prices that get JACKED UP multiple times what they were before, especially at deep OTM strikes.

>***So those deep OTM options that fueled the first gamma squeeze are now multiple times more expensive, which leads to significantly decreased purchasing and thus cripples the prospects for a gamma squeeze.***

Are MM's inflating prices intentionally to prevent a squeeze? Sort of- it's rising IV that's raising the price, but that works in their favor because it stifles the chances of a gamma squeeze.

**Parting Thoughts**

1. A gamma squeeze almost undoubtedly contributed to GME's rise, but I think whales took over after the initial squeeze and kept pumping the price. Maybe some shorts covered somewhere in there too. I honestly have no idea, which is why I'm not touching GME - although I am rooting for you monkeys to become bajillionaires.
2. In my opinion, **GME is not currently setup for an upwards gamma squeeze because there is not enough deep OTM call buying.** When you compare recent volume with what happened 2 weeks ago, it becomes obvious we're no where near setup for a call gamma squeeze
3. HOWEVER; as IV continues to decrease, that will make OTM call options cheaper again. **I am not recommending you buy those deep OTM short-term call options because chances are they will expire worthless**. With that said, that kind of ape-strength-fueled OTM call buying is what fueled the first squeeze...and it can certainly happen again. Although I'm not betting on it.

**Some important notes**

* **MMs hedge constantly throughout the day** as delta/gamma change. The idea that options expiring ITM or OTM will lead to a gamma squeeze after hours is ridiculous because MMs are actively hedging into close. If your long call expires ITM, the MM is already long the 100 shares by market close. This is why **gamma squeezes happen during market hours**.
   * The exceptions are when ATM options expire with non-zero deltas at expiration. In those cases, there is stock tied to those options at expiration and that stock will most likely be unwound in afterhours. This is probably not what happened with GME.
* Gamma squeezes can go **up or down**. Many of you seem to think that gamma squeezes only go up, but this is just wrong. **Squeezes follow the negative gamma** (MMs have negative gamma when you buy an option). If there's a lot of deep OTM call buying, that sets up for an upwards gamma squeeze; if there's a lot of deep OTM PUT buying, that sets up for a downwards gamma squeeze.
   * Right now, GME put buying heavily outweighs calls so, if anything, we're setup to squeeze lower.
* When there is **net option buying** (be it puts or calls) that creates **negative gamma** (the MMs) **which fuels volatility** and exacerbates price movements.
* When there is **net option SELLING**, that creates **positive gamma** **which suppresses volatility** and favors mean reversion to the largest gamma strike.
   * I'm of the belief that positive gamma creates a lot of support for SPY, and I use it to guide my SPY positions. It's worked out well for me, so that's why I use it.
* **Seriously, don't buy deep OTM short-term options**. 99 times out of 100 you're throwing your money away (that's why the delta is basically 0).
* There is a lot more nuance to this, such as options expiration, IV, long/short positions, and other things that are too complicated to discuss in one post. I've tried to simplify things, and hopefully I didn't make any mistakes in the process. When you consider that MMs are short some options and long others, it makes things more complicated.",2021-02-07 02:58:44

# **Fiscal stimulus prospects and strong earnings tailwind may propel stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/fiscal-stimulus-prospects-and-strong-earnings-tailwind-may-propel-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the week ahead with a tailwind, as investors focus on a hefty fiscal stimulus package and the solid earnings season against a backdrop of rising interest rates.
*****
> There are several dozen S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Cisco and The Walt Disney Co. On the data front, there are just a few reports in the coming week, but the consumer price index inflation report is the important one to watch when it is released Wednesday.
*****
> Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell speaks mid-week at a webinar hosted by the Economics Club of New York.
*****
> Stocks surged in the past week, with the S&P 500 jumping 4.65% to a new record high, in its best week since November. The S&P 500 closed Friday at 3,886.
*****
> The hyper-activity around short-squeeze names, like GameStop, receded in the past week. Market chatter turned to rising interest rates, the steepening yield curve and market expectations for inflation.
*****
> ‚ÄúRates are actually going up as really an expression of the potential that economic activity is likely to start accelerating, and we‚Äôll likely see some inflation,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> Hogan said investors will stay most focused on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which Democrats are pushing forward. If it is signed into law at its current size, the total federal spending due to the pandemic would be $5.3 trillion, according to Cowen, an investment bank.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the path of least resistance has resumed to a higher level. I think we had a mini correction a week ago and I think it happened pretty quickly,‚Äù said Hogan of National Securities.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think we continue to grind higher and the only bumps in the road that I can see are a delay in fiscal stimulus or some exogenous factor come in and changes the dynamics,‚Äù he added.
*****
> The market is also depending on continued improvement in new virus cases, said Hogan.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The prospect of more spending and an improving economy drove Treasury yields higher in the past week.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% late Friday, after edging to 1.18% earlier in the day, near its recent high of 1.19%.
*****
> The 10-year is the most closely watched, as it influences the rates on mortgages and other consumer and business loans. Yields rise as the price of bonds decline.
*****
> Market pros have also been watching another bond market metric: the yield curve.
*****
> It is the spread between the yield on a short-term Treasury, like the 2-year note, and a longer duration Treasury, like the 10-year. In that case, the spread widened to reach 1.06% over the course of the week.
*****
> That is the highest level since the second quarter of 2017. A steeper curve ‚Äî which is what we‚Äôre seeing today ‚Äî is viewed as a sign of an improving economy.
*****
> Strategists say the move higher in Treasury yields so far is not detrimental to stocks, but instead is a reflection of the economic bounce that could come from the stimulus package.
*****
> Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the steepening curve is good for the stock market, creating a tailwind for his ‚Äúepicenter‚Äù trade in stocks that will benefit from an improving post-Covid economy.
*****
> His preferred sectors are the cyclicals ‚Äî including industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, energy and financials.
*****
> Lee said the selling by hedge funds after short squeezes in a number of stocks and the record decline in the VIX, the volatility index, has led him to change his view on the stock market. He previously expected a sell-off in the first half of the year.
*****
> Now, Lee sees a ‚Äúhigh probability that the first half 2021 correction is over.‚Äù The VIX, which is based on puts and calls in the S&P 500, started the week over 33 and fell to 20.87 when the market closed on Friday. A low VIX signals lowered expectations for market volatility.
*****
> The sectors that did well in the past week were mostly the ones that will do better in a financial rebound, or in a higher rate environment. Financials were 6.6% higher in the past week as big banks rose along with the yield curve. Higher long-term interest rates are a positive for bank profits.
*****
> The industrial group rose 4.9%, and materials were up 3.9%. Energy, lifted by a jump in oil prices, gained 8.3%. Tech recovered some ground, gaining 4.9%.
*****
> Sectors that do not do particularly well with rising rates, were up less, including utilities, up 2.3%, and real estate investment trusts, up 3%.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about having an economic boom, allowing policy to support that boom,‚Äù said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key driver of why the curve is steepening.‚Äù
*****
> Some strategists say the curve is also steepening because of the U.S. will be issuing a lot of debt to pay for the trillions in fiscal stimulus, and that would cause interest rates to rise.
*****
> That has also triggered concerns about increasing inflation. While economists do not expect inflation to spike, they do see the potential, for the first time in years, for inflation to move meaningfully above 2%.
*****
> Markets will also be monitoring the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which begins Feb. 9.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt will get a lot of attention. Do the markets care? Maybe not, but everyone will be paying attention,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?

> There‚Äôs an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, ‚ÄúAs goes January, so goes the year.‚Äù This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.7% on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.

> # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?

> Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to ‚Äúlose less‚Äù rather than ‚Äúearn slightly more‚Äù than the value of the loan extended.

> The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the U.S.

> However, negative yielding debt does affect U.S. investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn 0.37% after hedging costs, compared with the -0.45% current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for U.S. debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and dampen the outlook for fixed income investors.

> What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of 1.25‚Äì1.75%.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/wallstreetbets.",2021-02-07 02:58:22
"PSA for ""diamond-handed apes""",11,le1jom,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1jom/psa_for_diamondhanded_apes/,50,1612659441.0,"""It's not a loss until you sell""

Guess what?  You can never gain unless you sell either. 

Trading is fundamentally easy:
1 Buy low
2 Sell high
3 Repeat

You broke rule one or two (maybe both), now you're holding a bag, and trying to find a greater fool to take it off your hands at more than $450.

Here's some tough love: You won't find one. 

You can run with the herd, but when it changes direction and runs the other way, be prepared to change your mind.

There's no rule that says you have to make your money back on the same company you lost it on.

Next steps if you actually want to be a trader:
Cut your losses. Lick your wounds. Learn a lesson from all this. Commit yourself to actually learning your craft. Recapitalize. Put on your big-boy pants. Get back in the game.",2021-02-07 02:57:21

üöÄ's are red

üçÖ's are red

üöÄüçÖüöÄ

üçÖ's üåàüêª's soon to be üíÄ

*(Real TLDR's at bottom)*

***‚ÄùWhy the !@&amp;? would I want that üçÖ growing stock?""***

Yo, brother, calm down that anger.

I'm not providing investment advice so stop right here if you like.

We're just having a casual conversation about a bunch of things on a stock [I'm personally YOLOing 65k on](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lddvy7/vff_getting_ready_for_its_next_take_off/). (Aka my positions, no ban!)

If you're unaware though, this 30 year produce (üçÖ) growing company has been utilizing their decades of experience to grow Cannabis with stellar results so far and with 2021 looking to be really good for them.

Specifically, this will be on show these first two quarters of the year.

An important side note is that as of November 2nd, they now privately own the full 100% of Pure Sunfarms, their Cannabis subsidiary.

***""Oh I should get in NOW, huh? I see that $***üçÖ ***ran recently, why would it keep running?""***

Great question brother! Of course, that's up to you! But...

$üçÖ actually has multiple aspects as to why this has a very likely chance to run, then stay at a price that is probably higher than you would think ""reasonable,"" and then still have more runs throughout the year.

First way to try and back this up, is pointing out that this low float stock of only 77,820,000 shares has a CEO that owns 12% of the stock himself, and a total of 13.6% owned by the Management and Board.

On top of that, another +12% of the float is held by institutional holders for an immediate 25% of this already low float stock off the table.

More on the float in a moment, but with that quick knowledge we next just need to take a quick peek at how $üçÖ's main competition's Share Price (SP), Share Count and Market Caps (MC) compare.

AFTER EACH COMPANIES **MARKET CAP (MC)** IS HOW MUCH EACH COMPANIES **SHARE PRICE (SP)** CAN GROW PER MARKET CAP GAIN OF $1 BILLION.

*As of close on February 5th:*

*Canopy Growth*: SP - $42.93 - 373,730,000 Shares

- $*16,044,228,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.68 per $1B MC

*Cronos Group*: SP - $12.01 - 356,190.000 Shares

- $*4,277,842,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $2.81 per $1B MC

*Aphria*: SP - $16.67 - 312,570,000 Shares

- $*5,210,542,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $3.20 per $1B MC

*Tilray*: SP - $25.72 - 148,260,000 Shares

- $*4,070,447,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $6.32 per $1B MC

*Aurora*: SP - $12.88 - ""183,660,000 Shares""

- $*2,365,541,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $5.44 per $1B MC

$üçÖ*/Village Farms*: SP - $15.09 - 77,820,000

- $*1,174,304,000 Market Cap* with SP growth of $12.85 per $1B MC

So, not only are they way behind in Market Cap, *even to Aurora*, but the amount that $üçÖ can gain in Share Price to get there is unmatched.

I'm not saying the other companies should go down...

I'm just sayin... look at this...

VFF - $2,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$üçÖ - $25.70

VFF - $3,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$üçÖ - $38.55

VFF - $4,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$üçÖ - $51.40

VFF - $16,000,000,000 Market Cap?

$üçÖ - $205.60

***‚ÄùSo what? They are THAT much behind the competition.""***

Hey, I get it brother, we've only talked only about superficial stock related info so far. 

Just setting the base in understanding it's growth potential based on their industry competitiors.

We're getting there, I promise!

Just one more thing about $üçÖ's current positioning though, which factors in a bit of a short squeeze.

Now, don't get it twisted, this is not a post about some one-time short squeeze, just a brief mention.

Just, *in this moment*, it so happens the timing could cause a little extra pop for this incoming next fundamental and technical run that will establish $üçÖ's new base level.

[Check it out, from 1/22 - 2/2 an average of 50% of the daily volume was short](https://fintel.io/ss/us/vff). Averaging about 25% of volume going short daily on either side of it as well.

This heavy shorting came at the heals of a recent company action that caused quick downward pressure on the Share Price and in turn gave *greedy* üçÖüåàüêª's ability to try and push it down unreasonably.

Did you notice the most recent closing price is $15.09 on Feb 5th?

You might not have noticed though, that on January 14th, $üçÖ had a mini run and peaked at $15.05.

The next day, on January 15th, $üçÖ dropped for a close of $12.65.

Closing above that previous mile stone means every short since the raise is now underwater. Just sayin'.

***‚ÄùWhat happened that caused that drop?""***

Good things happened, brother. Good things. And... *they got shorted for it*...?

$üçÖ announced a direct share offering that injected US$135Million cash to the bank @ $12.60, giving shorters a bit of strength over the last two weeks of January.

This semi large difference between the offering and Share Price at the time is indicative of something very important about this raise.

This was a planned raise that had nothing to do with the run $üçÖ was going on *IMO*.

*IMO*, don't mistake this raise, *that closed on U.S. Inauguration Day*, as anything other than preparation for growth and expansion. They are already executing profitably, they in no way needed this for normal functions.

You have to understand, our ol' üçÖ is extremely diligent and resourceful in their approach to Cannabis so far, and will continue to going forward.

Their lack of splash is probably why you likely haven't heard or considered them yet, but the precise and profitable execution is why you should do DD on them.

Oh, by the way...

$üçÖ has some of the best positioning and assets for the now inevitable U.S. legalization of Cannabis.

***‚ÄùHow is this Canadian LP, $***üçÖ ***, any better set for the U.S. market than their competition?""***

Again, stellar question's brother.

And, again, multiple factors to this.

Our first factor is a direct shout out to that $135M raise.

Quoting the üçÖ CEO from their most recent earnings report conference call and in reference to potential U.S. strategies, ""...*we're prepared to look at, if we have to do acquisitions or strategic partnerships and other locations*...""

That $135M putting them +$200M in bank is taking a certain type of vision, to me.

***‚ÄùWhat, I'm suppose to believe your opinion that they have U.S. potential from a quote and your speculation?""***

Naw brother, you're suppose to understand that *fact* because they already have 5.7 Million SqFt of ""Hemp"" grow space ready to go in Texas.

Speculation and understanding how this company functions is part of my YOLO call strikes though.

A heads up, Cannabis uses the same growing system and could ""*be rapidly converted to cannabis production*"" the moment ready. - üçÖ CEO

Even beside the U.S. Blue Wave that will have some type of effect on Cannabis, Texas has put forth multiple pieces of legislation up for up for debate on it's own.

With, or without my personal speculation on their raise, their Texas assets are shaping up to be extremely valuable for them in the likely near-term future.

Icing on the cake of it all is simply that they are in no rush at all for when it happens.

They're currently profitable, and growing from their Canadian and other international positions as well, so U.S. legalization is simply a massive bonus whenever it happens, not a necessity.

*Like for some unnamed others...*

***‚ÄùYeah, so what? That still doesn't say WHY $***üçÖ ***would keep running outside of hype.""***

Hey, absolutely that's fact.  *So far.*

Now that we understand their comparative surroundings and asset ready U.S potential, let's bring in some internal üçÖ Cannabis biz facts.

Here are a couple of the most recent earnings, Q3's, Cannabis specific highlights:

*75% increase in Net Sales*

*81% increase in Gross Profits*

Impressive as that is, it's important to understand this is not some one-off fluke, but the first point in the provable continuation of their launching point for growth, which was Q3's the prior quarter, Quarter 2 2020.

I say launching point because of the execution of strategy over the last year and they have a lot of factors on why they will continue to see growth in their numbers.

The key to understanding the earnings and $üçÖ share price growth potential is in the timeline details of their release approach for new strains, products, product segments, and accessibility.

***‚ÄùWhat, a few random new products is you're point?""***

Well, it's a part of the main reason on *timing* of the moments before earnings, yes.

Because brother, it's not just *any* new products, but specific new segments of products that are brand new pies of profitability to eat from for extra growth potential generally...

...*and also how they set up their earnings reports for ""surprise"" growth effects with a specific style of WHEN they release their new products.*

This upcoming Quarter 4 Year End 2020 report with be the first quarter to have their 2.0 products available for a FULL quarter. Our feature earnings growth products for Q4 are Vapes and Oils.

Being released mid-September, the very end of Q3, that Q3 report got a nice C$1Million boost in Net Sales from the roll out and because of the timing of release Q4 will see an exponential effect of growth from that segment due to that timeline of release.

Similarly, Quarter 1 2021, aka right now, will have TWO additional new segment effects!

On December 21st, just before the end of Q4, they started offering their products for Medical for the first time through a deal with Shoppers Drug Mart.

An important key to this Medical deal is this is their first entry into Quebec, the last 30% of Canada they need. üçÖ's brand was also the first brand to offer anything in the Ounce size for the Shoppers consumers.

Seeing the ~1 week effect medical might be interesting!...

to me....

Our other brand new segment that is now fully rolled out is edibles!

Earlier in January, üçÖ announced a deal with White Rabbit, an edible company with a vegan, gluten-free craft gummy company with a manufacturing process call EAT ME. 

With this, üçÖ has started offering White Rabbit products as of about mid January.

By establishing this parternship, üçÖ now has access to that process and as of February 5th now released their own branded edibles as well.

Pretty forward thinking and sustainable to ensure to grab a good tasting vegan and gluten-free craft gummy.

This win-win situation means no messing with growing pains, straight to the bottom line move. Love it.

***‚ÄùAgain, so what? Wha..""***

Don't mean to be rude, but I *wasn't* done yet...

Both the upcoming Q4 and Q1 have additional bonus growth factors!

For Quarter 4, first week of October, aka first week of Quarter 4, saw the release of their newest higher THC and higher priced Pink Kush and D.Bubba strains were release in their large 14g and 28g formats.

When these strains released for the 7g and less formats on a similar timeline fashion, the small format sizes saw an increase of 33% on Net Sales over the Volume sold.

Like I said, simply bonus growth factors from the decades old üçÖ company that understands the importance of showing growth Quarter over Quarter in a flooded industry with such tremendous potential.

For Quarter 1, early January also saw the release of their High THC vapes in addition to their current offerings.

***‚ÄùBro, are you done yet?""**

Okay okay jeez, I get it.

*There's still just like one-ish more things though...*

On a very quick view of some Marco-level elements, many provinces had extra legal red tape on providing licenses with Ontario being one of them.

Ontario also just so happens to be üçÖ's biggest customer, and had also been known for being a province with the least amount of stores for the amount of population they have.

In August 2020, they upped the number of store licenses they were issuing from 20 to 40 per month, just in time for Q4...

In December 2020, they doubled it again to 80 licenses a month, just in time for Q1...

To put a little perspective on that, by the end of the most recently reported quarter, Q3 2020, about 190 licenses were issued.

By Q3 2021, approximately 1,070 licenses will have been issued. 

Generally, about ~90% of the licensees have their stores up and running each time Ontario reports its updates. That's a lot more stores brother.

This matters because we also know the üçÖ's brand is increasing in popularity for Ontario as well.

After being +13% of the OCS's volume from October 2019 to October 2020, October 2020 specificallywas 15% of the dried flower volume going üçÖ brand. Aka increasing in popularity.

On top of that, we were also told their brand new segment, vapes, was about *top ~3 ish* for Quarter 4 in the OCS as of November.

***‚ÄùThis still doesn't really explain why they will grow... does it?""***

Look brother, it's a Reddit post that's already too long but I believe I've shown a lot of üçÖ positive factors to add on top of what was already going to see growth by itself.

The Cannabis industry is hot right now you guys.

Beyond retail, their Wholesale segment experienced a +140% surge in volume and sales in Q3 as well, with indicators that Q4 will continue steady growth in that cornerstone of additional revenue.

Being the cheapest producer in the game will continue to have it's benefits. If you think it's Aphria, you are incorrect. Aphria is solid, but the üçÖ beats them out pretty easily. 

Aphria Market Cap is also $5B to üçÖ's $1B...

When it comes down to it, this Quarter 4 earnings report needs to speak for itself. I have my own personal opinion on what it might look like. Do your own research for your own opinion, brother.

Finally, just so you're in-the-know, my last notes are some recent analyst price targets for $üçÖ

Global Alliance - $20

Roth Capital - $22

Raymond James - $26

Beacon 1-year target - $35

Some supposedly big German Stock magazine - $30

Random people on Twitter - $+20

**Well, fun conversation brother!**

**Don't forget, this was in zero ways financial advice, but if you wanted more not intended to be the basis of any investment decision $**üçÖ **related information, or wanted to try and argue some point you think I jumped to,** [I wrote a very deep dive VFF analysis with Q4 prediction](https://justwantgainz.bobson.com/p/reddvffdd) **potentially worth checking out first (+40% Gross Sales and +60% Gross Profit conservatively predicted).**

**TLDR;**

1 ) Comparatively, Village Farms (üçÖ)'s Market Cap is 1/16 of Canopy, 1/4 of Cronos, 1/5 of Aphria, 1/4 of Tilray, and 1/2 of Auroras.

2 ) Being a low float stock with 25% institutional holders and massive recent shorting that is now underwater will likely cause an extra short squeeze on top of the incoming technical/fundamental run.

3 ) 5.7 Million Sq Ft of grow space in Texas ready for quick and immediate Hemp to Cannabis conversation at the drop of any U.S. Legislation. Also, $üçÖ cashed up for acquisition potential.

4 ) Release time line for Vapes, Oils, High THC Large Format Offerings, Medical (with Quebec), High THC Vapes, 3rd Party Gummies and 1st Party Gummies will all have debut showings on these upcoming Quarter 4 2020, Quarter 1 2021 and Quarter 2 2021 earnings reports.

5 ) Massively increasing store number from üçÖ's best consumer, continued best-in-industry grow process for continued Wholesale strength, increasing quality and popularity of their products show positive trends of growth from their current segments as well as all the new ones.

6 ) Scroll up a smidge to check some analyst price targets.

The good news about your GME story,105,le1gwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1gwj/the_good_news_about_your_gme_story/,52,1612659214.0,"WSB has a huge number of new users, many of whom are first-time bagholders as well. I think we should welcome the new users with open arms. Hi. Welcome.

I'm going to talk about the past few weeks and where things could go from here.

&#x200B;

**THE PAST**

In my opinion, no matter what happens going forward, GME was a total success. It was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence and retail traders made it happen‚Äîthat's amazing. It's now an international story. Incredible. I know it's still developing and I'm not informed enough to comment on specific outcomes here, but I think it's awesome. It happened, in large measure, because of the awesome due diligence written by some of the hyper-smart retards of this sub.

A big part of the story is DFV. I caught on to [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) pretty late, only a few months ago when his account broke $2M. I was astonished at his conviction, and hypnotized by the prismatic, dancing light refracting through his diamond fucking dick. Right now, even if GME drops back to $20 tomorrow, he will be worth something like $15M (he's sitting on $13.8M cash). That's... I don't even have a word for how cool it is. His red headband and aviators belong in the Smithsonian.

Some folks made a ton of money on GME, and some are bagholding a fat loss. That's OK. Even the best traders have losses. And it may prove to be super valuable to some of you, because that heavy bag you're holding has a voucher tucked into the side pocket. Yep, right there... no no, outside pocket‚Äîyes. See it? That voucher holds a tremendous opportunity:

**It's the opportunity to stop being a dumbass**. ***But how?***

&#x200B;

I'm gonna briefly diverge here to talk about my WSB story. I joined summer of 2020, knowing nothing, but was drawn in by these insane GAIN posts that kept popping up on my feed. I didn't know what a fucking call or put was‚Äîshit, *I didn't even know how to buy a share of a stock*. But I lurked, and obsessed, and kinda started to figure things out, little by little.

Then came Purple (PRPL). I read the extensive DD, I followed the stock price movement closely, I even followed the CEO on Twitter (he doesn't tweet much). I looked into the play as much as I knew how, and when I pulled the trigger *I was so confident*. I sunk $3.5k into debit spreads (something you too can learn!), which was more than I was comfortable losing. But I was confident‚Äîthey were going to crush earnings so it was pretty much a guarantee.

Well, earnings missed. Just a bit. The stock dipped and kept dipping. Over the next week I was down something like 80%, I don't remember exactly. I was pretty crushed. I was so mad at myself, ""Of fucking course a stock can go down, *why would you think it can only go up?*"" Recrimination, doubt. I knew I wasn't cut out for this...

But I kept coming back to WSB if only, at first, to salve my wounds with the loss porn of fellow fallen PRPL nurples. Then I watched more YouTube videos on options. And I learned‚Äîmostly from people on this sub‚Äîhow to minimize the financial pain of that loss, and maybe break even.

I bought shares, I learned how to sell covered calls. I don't remember exactly everything I did, I was experimenting and learning. After a few months I eventually I broke even.

And I kept experimenting, and watching, and reading.

Beginning of this year I deposited a bunch of money into my brokerage and put myself in really solid positions that I liked. I armed myself with knowledge, I knew my entry points, I knew when I wanted to take on more risk. **As of today, I am in spitting distance of doubling my account since the beginning of the year. That fucking rules.**

I'm still learning. I don't know everything. In fact, I think I'm still a novice, and who fucking knows I could blow my account up tomorrow. But the more I learn, the more the picture of trading becomes illuminated, instead of the inscrutable dark mass it was six months ago.

&#x200B;

**THE FUTURE**

I don't know what's going to happen to GME in the next week, month, year. No idea. If you want to hold GME forever and not really think about the stock market, that's totally fine. But, if you want to dig yourself out of a hole, if you want to keep going with stonks, here's the good news: you can learn.

So what do you do now?

**Shut the fuck up and listen to smarter people**. And read. And watch videos. And see what experienced traders and investors are doing.

Because this sub has recently turned into a roiling ocean of samethink, many of you don't know the power of this place: *you're sitting on a fucking gold mine*. I have read due diligence in here that rivals that of professional analysts, and in some cases is *more insightful and more detailed* (and always funnier)*.* And IT'S FREE.

Do you think DFV got into GameStop on a whim? Because he thought it would be a fun little troll play, and that maybe he could stick it to the hedge funds along the way? No. Go watch his YouTube channel. He knows what he's doing. He is a **fucking pro**.

Remaining stupid isn't an option‚Äîyou want to be a *smart* retard, not a *dumb* retard.

Before I get too Glengarry Glen Ross on y'all asses, here are some tough love, concrete suggestions:

&#x200B;

**Stop posting and** ***telling*** **people to buy, hold, or sell stonks**

* That's not your call and it may be illegal
* It's amateurish and cringey
* It's perfectly fine to share your positions or say you're still holding

&#x200B;

**Stop calling it a movement**

* We're here to make money, learn, and help each other do both‚Äîit's not a political movement
* It's profoundly cringey

&#x200B;

**Stop spamming posts asking if GME, AMC, BB, NOK will ""go up""**

* No one *really* knows
* *You* decide whether you should sell or hold
* If you have relevant information about the stonk, that's great! Post it. ""Will XXX go up?"" is not relevant.

&#x200B;

**Take a break from reddit, your broker, even your computer/phone**

* Staring at a stonk for hours, hoping it will go up, is not healthy‚Äîtrust me
* You'll be doing your brain a service if you step back and come back refreshed

There needs to be a truce between Gme holders and old timers,128,le1c90,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1c90/there_needs_to_be_a_truce_between_gme_holders_and/,108,1612658821.0,"This is getting ridiculous. Half the sub is yelling HOLD and the other half is yelling SELL. I'm holding my shares and i don't need you apes to tell me when i need to get out. I will when i'm satisfied. 

And GME people need to slow down with their spams and circlejerking. I agree it's making the sub ridiculous.

We can all co-exist in this sub. No need to tell people to go to another sub just because you don't like it. Things change and GME was much bigger than a sub with ~2 million members at the time. 

This unrest will destroy the sub not gme holders or old timers.

Edit: with 8 million members now, you can't just attack whoever says gme. As old timers you need to show the way of WSB. Or you can go to another sub and let this one rot. Your call.

This is one more post to remind you to remain skeptical and analyze the posts you're reading and do your own DD. I'm not a super OG here, but I've been around for over a year and it's insane how obvious the trickery is, how many super manipulative posts and comments I'm seeing that oppose this sub's mantra right now. SO MUCH sudden gain porn amount gme sellers, posts trash talking holders, saying holding is a bad strategy when you're down, and posts trying to justify selling right now in any way possible. They are designed to sound logical, or even be filled with a few logical points, with the part about how you should sell carefully transplanted in. BULLSHIT obviously. Listen, retard, you don't typically buy SHARES to try to make a fat short term gain, you trade options, so anyone convincing you that it's a normal, good idea to buy and sell shares on highs and lows in a small time frame is a dumbass. If you buy shares, you typically hold for longer than a fucking week and go for a ride for some real growth; or you learn your hypothesis was wrong or was changed by an event and you pivot. This is normal. Yes, there is a potential squeeze, which is more reason to keep your fucking pants on. Yes, the hypothesis has remained 100% unchanged, though certain news sources will try to have you believe otherwise. Missing a high isn't the end of the world, be patient and it will inevitably surpass that price in some amount of time if the company isn't doomed (it's not) and the economy isn't tanking (it's not). In this case, probably pretty god damn soon. At least if you don't listen to me listen to fucking Cuban, his words were a blessing for this sub, powerful messages to keep us united through this shit storm coming from someone that has a lifetime of experience. Remember why you bought GME, has it changed? Then continue pursuing the value play you started until it does. If you bet more than you can afford to say goodbye to for months/years, you probably fell prey to fomo and are an amateur. That's not ideal, so don't ruin your life over this shit, be realistic. If you can afford to, it's common fucking sense to hold right now. Hey, now you get to learn to weather a storm like any seasoned trader so SIT DOWN, BUCKLE UP, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Hard Truth: It's Entirely Mathematically Possible for Shorts to Cover Last Week,14,le1ate,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1ate/hard_truth_its_entirely_mathematically_possible/,36,1612658722.0,"If a share can be shorted multiple times, it can be bought and covered multiple times. 

How did 140% short ratio happened:

A has one GME share, A loans the share to B, B sold it short to C, C loans it to D, D sold it short to E. One share, shorted twice. B and D both needs to cover their shorts when they needed to. 

The same scenario can be played the other way around. 

Hedge Fund A bought 1 share from Bank B to cover and return to Bank C, Hedge Fund D then bought the same share from Bank C to cover and return to Bank E. One share, covered twice. 

Now imagine last week, the price is above $200, you are a greedy ass Wall St bank and you have a lot of GME shares on hand and a lot of shares loaned out, do you :

(1) sell it to the shorts multiple times for ridiculous gain yourselves?

or 

(2) just shrug and let the retails take this cake?

The trading volume for GME is above 300m per week for the last  4 weeks, with the highest week to be 550m.  the short float was 72m at its peak. The trading volume is enough for them to cover multiple times every week.

Have they actually covered? Your call. Fuck if I know. We will find out in Feb 9th.",2021-02-07 02:45:22

The homeless man is sitting on a park bench, rugged, clothes drenched and stained. This man has evidently been homeless for quite some time. Our friendly civilian approaches the homeless man, a single dollar bill in hand. ‚ÄúExcuse me sir, I don‚Äôt have much to give, I paperhanded GME back in 2021, but I hope this dollar helps.‚Äù The homeless man looks up, through the grime and dirt on his face our civilian is still able to recognize him. ‚ÄúOh my goodness, you‚Äôre Diamond Hand Dumbass!‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed I am.‚Äù Replies the homeless man.

The Virginia legislature just legalized Marijuana for recreational use. If you aren't familiar with Virginia politics let me tell you: this is a big deal. Virginia legalizing could be the gateway for more conservative states.I think we could be looking at Federal legalization within the next four years, and probably sooner.

 Altria bought a 45% stake in Cronos, a marijuana technology company. There are few companies I can think of that are better positioned to profit from national legalization than Altria. 

ATM Calls expiring January 2022 are only 3.40. Calls expiring a year later are only a dollar more. I think if we saw an end to Federal prohibition during the next year, we could see Altria stock move up significantly. It's down 50% in the last couple years and could be poised for a big move.

# How does the EV Sector Exponential Growth help BB?

Well, the 2020 to 2022 is a period for gaining significant momentum in the Smart EV sector and which shall rapidly accelerate from 2023 to 2025. As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.

Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.

As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.

Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.

# How is BB coping up during the COVID?

The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company‚Äôs endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.

# What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

The Company is developing a concept system to integrate BlackBerry Spark capabilities, including AI and machine learning technologies, with BlackBerry QNX automotive solutions. Have to watch out for more information during the earnings calls.

# How was the Customers growth among BB products?

**QNX:**

QNX was acquired by BB in 2010, right from that moment, BB started its journey in Automotive industry. Initially, it has launched Infotainments and Telematic under QNX product category and it was deployed on leading car manufacturers. It started branching out and was able to offer more products under QNX. Now it is has aligned itself very well for the next gen EV cars.

Adoption of QNX products from 2016 to 2020:

* 2016 - 50 Million
* 2017 - 60 Million
* 2018 - 120 Million
* 2019 - 150 Million
* 2020 - 175 Million

As we see, the growth has been substantial, and we can expect it grow more as we see more cars from new manufacturers and from existing ones and also automotive driving platforms especially in EV sector. There are currently 1.4 billion cars approximately.  In 2018, approximately¬†4.2 million heavy commercial vehicles¬†and just over 20 million¬†light commercial vehicles¬†were produced throughout the world.

It‚Äôs estimated to have at least 470 million cars by 2025.

Chen stated that there won't be much of the revenue growth from IVY until 2023.

>Under the terms of our agreement, BlackBerry will own all the commercial relationships with customers and will share revenues with AWS.  
>  
>The target is to be in the 2023 year‚Äôs auto model, with possibly potentially some professional services prior to it. While it is too early for us to provide a revenue outlook, we are confident that BlackBerry IVY addresses a very large market opportunity that will greatly increase our ASP.

# BB Revenue:

Check the Spreadsheet for the Revenue Sources.

[2021 Fiscal year](https://imgur.com/pFnGMId)

Note: Software and Services include these products IoT, QNX, BlackBerry Spark, AtHoc, Radar.

The revenue got impacted due to 2020 chaos especially on the QNX product side. According to the earning calls. There are still on track to maintain the gross margin over 70% and dollar net retention rate is above 90%.

As you see, the [gross margin](https://imgur.com/Qf6fp2n) has been consistent past few years and revenue is steadily increasing every year.

[Growth in Revenue from Products from 2019-2013](https://imgur.com/ODRyRZY)

Notes:

In 2019, due to restructuring, BB was unable to close deals, we should see +ve in 2020.

IoT: Comprised of QNX products, UEM, & Radar

Other: Handheld Devices and Service Access Fee (SAF)

Since BB was moving away from manufacturing of devices gradually, in 2020 most of it done by third party companies. That‚Äôs why we have negative growth under **Other.**

# Pricing for BB products

**QNX Pricing:**

As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.

Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.

Link: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/)

Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.

This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.

We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the above spreadsheet you saw list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using

IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.

**Radar Pricing:**

Estimation in 2017:

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.

The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry‚Äôs channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.

Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.

**Cylance Pricing:**

Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.

Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance‚Äôs AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.

At present, the market share is below 1%.

**Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:**

**QNX:**

According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $42.7 billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)

Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$ 4.5 billion by 2026

And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)

**Endpoint Protection (Cylance):**

The global endpoint security market is expected to grow from 13.58 billion $ in 2020 to 19.24 billion $ in 2025 at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period.

[https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/endpoint-security-market).

Assuming the market share in endpoint increases to \~3%. It can be around 577 million

**Asset Management (Radar):**

Global asset tracking market will reach $36.3B by 2025, growing at 15% CAGR

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995009/0/en/Global-Asset-Tracking-Market-2020-2025-Insights-Into-Technologies-Solutions-and-the-Ecosystem-Including-Major-Players.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995009/0/en/Global-Asset-Tracking-Market-2020-2025-Insights-Into-Technologies-Solutions-and-the-Ecosystem-Including-Major-Players.html)

We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It‚Äôs quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.

**Challenges:**

QNX:

Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.

There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.

IVY:

Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software‚Äôs.

Cylance:

Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.

The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.

Radar:

It‚Äôs barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).

In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.

Thanks to OP's and go give a read at these DD's too:

Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.

Positions: 400 shares @ 12 and 2 Jan 20 2023 SP 15. I plan to add more as I see the potential and growth in the newly introduced products.

Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, I'm merely a random person who loves BB and would like to see this company fly to new heigths. Cheers to everyone!!

I've never really invested in a portfolio. My whole life I was taught two things: **keep your money in safe, steady growth locations, have have multiple locations.** So, that's what I've done. I have a savings account, a Roth IRA, a retirement fund, and as of May 2020, a portfolio. I started real small, with $1000. That money quickly grew to about $1300 and I realized that I could make smart buying decisions based on the news and my friend's (who is a CFA) advice). He convinced me to invest in some tech stonks early on as well as some other endeavors that have paid out handsomely. Not much in terms of gross $$, but from a % growth standpoint the money was huge.

Over time I started putting money that would normally go into my savings into my portfolio because, well, it was growing so much faster. I had a lot of growth off of tech stock investments, and now I have my hands in some fairly lucrative pies. **I then learned about WSB in mid-January and saw everything that was going on with GME, et. al.** I was skeptical, so I watched the market for a while. I thought 'oh hey, this could be a fun gamble, let's play ball.' I bought 10 shares of BB at $10. As it blew up I prowled the posts and saw that while GME was at $50, AMC was only at $5, and the plan to squeeze was targeted at both of them. So I bought 60 shares of AMC @ $5. A few days later, specifically, on January 29th, my money had exploded so I said okay one more small buy. I tossed in for 1 share of GME at $320, three shares of KO$$ at 69. **One hour later RH restricted buying.**

I guess I should've just dumped everything right there but I loved the camaraderie that I saw here. Obviously, I knew that a reddit sub wasn't about to take down any major hedge funds, but I did see an opportunity to expose these assholes like in 2008. So I held. Then when GME started to fall, I bought another 4 shares at $85, and I tossed my remaining balance on AMC. Everything together we're looking at about $1,500 put toward this effort.

Obviously, the outlook isn't a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. And yet, I'm holding. Why? Why would I hold after admitting I made an objectively stupid series of buys? Answer: Because I can afford to, and because I like to gamble. It's fun to me. I'm not rich by any measure, but I'm smart enough to understand that this is a group of RETARDS who know very little about finances. So I wanted to have fun with it, and I decided to invest about 10% of my portfolio into this mess. That said, my portfolio only makes up about 10% of my total net worth, if even that much. **So, at best, I've invested 1% of my net worth into this ""movement.""**

The moral of my story should be clear:

# You're all idiots. I'm an idiot. This is DUMB.

But it's also fun. And you know what? If you put 80% of your life savings into buying GME at $350, you're a fucking dumbass. That is not, and has never been how money works. **These guys posting loss and gain porn on this site? There's what, two dozen of them? Out of 8,500,000?!** Come on, stop. You think you're going to outsmart a series of billionaires just because some guy who bought 50,000 shares of a dead stock in July said it might work one of these days? Stop it, get some help.

And to the ""OG members"" who think that they are just so smart for manipulating the market at a FRACTION of the efficiency, stealth, and organization that hedge fund operators do it EVERY DAY, I say you can lick my nutsack from the back. Cool, a couple hundred people got lucky and ya caught Melvin off guard for a week. But honestly, shame on you assholes for screaming ""HOLD HOLD HOLD"" when GME was tanking from 400 all the way down to 120. **People were watching their lives disintegrate because of a damn joke that they weren't in on from the gate.** Guess what, you're Melvin now. You fucked the little guy and got rich doing it. How's it feel?

The entire world was watching and NOBODY wants to be exposed to this type of event again.

I'm losing hope that this type of thing will happen again in the next 10 years.

**TL;DR - Why this won't happen again**

1. Every financial institution is now aware of this type of risk
2. They have every analyst working to mitigate this in the future
3. They are learning how to break the rules better

# What are the Risk departments doing right now?

**Background:** I was a Data Scientist in the Risk/Underwriting department of a finance company for 3 years (not on wallstreet, just a B2C company for small consumer loans).

&#x200B;

**1. They are getting their ass handed to them.**

Risk teams hate attention because it's always bad. This is their worst nightmare.

The CEO is asking why the fuck they didn't see this coming and warn them. And why a bunch of literally retarded autists on reddit knew about this before they did.

**2. They are dedicating 100% of their resources to making sure they see this type of thing coming.**

Every Analyst up to the PhD jerkoffs that thought they were going to be playing with deep neural networks are instead currently spending all of their time running queries and making plots in excel for every ""what-if"" scenario that the executives can think of.

They may have gotten fucked last month, but now they have TONS of data to train models and run scenarios with. They are going to be ready next time.

**3. They are learning what rules they can break.**

Things like Failure-to-Deliver and limiting buys on certain securities are now additional levers that they are learning how to pull and are currently building models for. They don't give a fuck if something is ""illegal"" or ""unethical"". Instead they have a simpler function to guide their decisions:

`E(Revenue) = E(Gains from doing illegal shit) - E(Legal fees and costs)`

If they make more money doing illegal shit than it costs, then they do it.

110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish!,2024,le4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4hoh/110_institutional_ownership_or_110_short_interest/,206,1612667665.0,"People were shocked to hear ""over 100% of GME shares have been shorted"" or ""institutions own over 100% of GME shares.""

**""How is that possible?""**

It's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.

Here's the simple case:

Andy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says ""I like this stock and that's a fair price"" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!

These numbers are, for the purposes of the market, ""real"" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That *may* cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.

**""But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?""**

They can't - it's important to understand that *you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.* Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has *not* loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp)

So in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.

**""This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?""**

NOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can *only* lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They *cannot* lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.

At first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.

Now, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \[current stock price\]x\[current interest price\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close... i.e. a squeeze.

(I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)

**""Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?""**

Yes, specifically his words were *""Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes.""*

[https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080)

**""Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?""**

Yes.

1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.
2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.
3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).
4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.

edit: u/rozhasi says ""Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can‚Äôt lend your shares to short sellers.""

edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though *new* Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) *If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.*

edit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending **on by default**, but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on [scrive.com](https://scrive.com)) so I'm hesitant to share it, but more info can be found here:  [https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/](https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/) .

Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock‚Äôs activity. I own shares of GME.*

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/


The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. The 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions is displayed here is old data, and the current number is closer to [177% (explained here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_gm9jjp0). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.


GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less. 

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make. 

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the ""squeeze.""

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. ""The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron.""

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy the stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently ""low"" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B. 

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a retard like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to ""cover,"" but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.",2021-02-07 05:11:45

Hello Paper Hands,

I see your posts about how you can't hold out any longer. I'm not here to tell you what to do, only to share a personal story.

I invested heavily into low and mid range Jameis Winston rookie cards shortly after he was cut from the Buccs. Retarded right? Most people thought so and card shop owners audibly laughed at my requests for them. I had them trading me Prizm Winston cards for Low End Daniel Jones and Drew Lock rookies before the 2020 season began. Then he signed with the Saints and his card value had a small jump... I could have had paper hands and took my profit then and there, but I believed the value was higher than that, I LIKED THE STOCK then as much as I do now, so I held.

Cut forward to midseason 2020, Brees goes down and Winston is not named the starter. Do I panic? No, because I trust what I see, Winston is a better QB than Taysom Hill.

Cut forward again to the NFC Playoffs, cameras catch Brees telling Winston ""This is your team now."" His price starts to climb, but hesitently as nothing is yet official. I know the Saints are not going to draft a starting QB this year, and they are in no financial situation to make a play for one on the market. So I hold, because I know the value will be higher when he is offically named the starter and the 2021 season starts.

That's 2 years of holding. Not even a scratch on these DIAMOND HANDS. 

I can honestly say the most difficult hold of all was the first one, when he signed to the Saints. The chance to get out with a small profit was tempting. Although I knew it would be a long hold, once I made the decision there was no turning back, I knew the regret of knowing I was right and went against my gut was a longer hold. I'm still holding those rookie cards btw, gonna be for atleast a little while longer. üíéüëê Right up until I believe he's hit peak value...

There is a social media manipulation campaign going on surrounding certain commodities,207,le42nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le42nm/there_is_a_social_media_manipulation_campaign/,52,1612666523.0,"I've been following the Gamestop trend on here for the past couple of weeks and, much like other people, have started to notice a lot of strange posts about silver.

Digging into some of the account histories of those promoting silver, we find some interesting things:

[This link](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ieae/i_went_full_retard_and_bought_15_kilograms_of/) - a 3 year old account with 1 month of posting history, oldest visible post on a trading subreddit.

[This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gkzfeb3/) - an account which just started posting regularly 4 days ago and posted a hilariously easy to photoshop image as ""proof"" of holdings (with 17 awards).

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72m7j/when_should_we_go_all_in_on_silver/) - 10 month old account which mainly posted about MMA until 3 days ago, since then only posts have been about silver.

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70j2t/punish_the_banks_punish_the_hedges_buy_the_one/) - year old account with sporadic posting history....until 3 days ago when they started posting about silver.

[This - one of the most obviously astroturfed posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/) - a 9 month old account with two posts 8 months ago and every post since then (in the last 4 days) about silver.

Realistically, it would probably cost around $1500 to give that many awards to that post. $1500 is pocket change to firms like Citron which hold a big stake in silver.

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l723fs/guys_now_is_the_time_for_silver_it_is_currently/) - posted 3 days ago (noticing a pattern?) - 3 year old account, just became active again after about a year.

The list goes on from that obviously.

A good chunk of those accounts appear to be purchased accounts. The tell-tale sign is a huge gap in post history and way off topic posting. Anyone with a couple thousand dollars lying around could do it. For huge firms which already held millions of dollars in silver/silver securities, it's like pissing into the ocean.

The Emotionally Intelligent Investor,4,le423g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le423g/the_emotionally_intelligent_investor/,16,1612666478.0,"All I'm trying to tell you people  is you get laid if you said

 ""Babes it was a crazy day, but i was emotional intelligent and held. ""

Emotional Intelligence challenges several long-held assumptions and beliefs, by asserting that a good investment approach starts with introspection. Too many investment gurus tell you to emulate their techniques despite the fact that you may have very different personality traits, motivations and biases. Would Zion Williams tell a short basketball player to play like him? Investors need to create a unique template for self-reflection and a framework for developing an investment approach that works best with who you are. Whereas the consensus opinion is that investing success comes from blocking out emotions and making purely rational decisions, the best money managers actually use their feelings. They actively sense what others in the market are thinking, and they employ gut instincts when making decisions. Nevertheless, virtually all investing text books neglect to mention how to best cultivate and utilize empathetic and intuitive realizations. By creating your own investment template, you will develop an investing advantage by putting yourself in someone else‚Äôs shoes. You will also discover how a stock chart is a great tool for understanding what the current holders of a security may be feeling, and you will appreciate why technical analysis works. Superior returns primarily depend on self-awareness, empathy and intuition.",2021-02-07 04:54:38

I made a post roughly 60 days ago about a 30k ‚ÄúYOLO‚Äù on GME. I purchased the 25c 4/16 with roughly 77 contracts. My cost basis was about 5 dollars a contract since I bought before earnings. I diamond handed them through the rough days where we saw GME drop heavy after earnings.

Two nights before GME took off, I sold my position. I keep going back, and I keep asking myself. Why? Why did I sell? I was so confident this would play out. I Fucking went all in and sat on my position through all of the ups and downs. Truth is, I don‚Äôt know why I sold. I believe I was bored, and just wanted to trade something. I couldn‚Äôt stand not trading. 

When the run up began, I felt sick. I threw up, and my body wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking. Life changing money for me. I kept checking the value of the contracts that I had, every 15 minutes and counting all the money I would‚Äôve had if I didn‚Äôt throw my contracts away.

I began shaking and crying. Hating myself for being such a paper handed bitch. So I went all in again on a GME weekly. I watched that weekly call double my original position, and then eventually ride to 0. That‚Äôs right. 

I blew up my account. I‚Äôve only been trading options for less than a year but at the top of GMEs run my position would‚Äôve been roughly 4mil.  

I‚Äôve gone from 20k -> 60k -> 3k -> 20k -> 36k -> 0

Everyone including friends and family keep asking if I‚Äôve heard about GME. Yeah bitch, I heard about it. It hurts to talk about. I tell my story, and they all tell me how sorry they feel for me when I tell them I could‚Äôve been a multi millionaire.

Do you want to know why I don‚Äôt have millions right now? Because of these mother fucking paper hands. 

As I watch you retards gamble your life savings at the top of GME, diamond handing it to the bottom, I can‚Äôt help but to think that you guys are fucking retarded. 

You‚Äôre all retarded but you‚Äôre like me. You belong here, and I certainly belong here. 

As we speak, I‚Äôm pulling funds out of the retirement account and going back at it. 

Why? Is it because I‚Äôm a Retard? Maybe. But I‚Äôm a Retard with a dream, and that can be scary thing and I realize that.

Godspeed to you all.

Rack your brain. What‚Äôs going to be a huge industry in the coming years that you can get in on the ground floor? Something you can buy a bunch of shares in? Why not smoke some weed to help you think? Great Scott. Of course. The solution is right there in front of you, sandwiched between a sweating Jack In The Box cup and a broken iPad used to roll joints on. You‚Äôll invest in weed stocks. Everyone likes weed and Joe Biden is going to legalize it soon! Look at that, you can buy weed stocks for CHEAP! $SNDL is barely more than a dollar share. With $80 you‚Äôre practically a majority shareholder!

You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.

I could throw a bunch of complicated DD at you right now with charts and acronyms so we could both pretend we‚Äôre smart. But it really isn‚Äôt complicated. If weed stocks are going to surge due to legalization then someone explain why when weed is legalized in certain states the price of an ounce can plummet to $60? You‚Äôre talking about a commodity literally ANYONE can grow in their home. It‚Äôs as if climate scientists expect that rain will turn to beer within the month and you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll invest in Budweiser!‚Äù

I can feel you getting defensive and I understand. Won‚Äôt some company end up being the biggest out of them all and worth a lot of money? What about peripheral industries like Akerna? Wait, Screech died? When?

Over-saturation is going to be the biggest thing with legalized weed (See: $60 ounce). Supply side will be local or at largest, regional. If I‚Äôm in Seattle why am I ordering weed and paying shipping costs from North Carolina? Or even worse getting it from Canada with all the international trade headaches? There is literally nothing they can offer me that can‚Äôt be grown or produced locally. Nor is this like the wine industry where climate conditions can influence the product. I can grow this anywhere. Which also means there is still a massive black market for weed.

When I say black market I don‚Äôt mean guys with face scars meeting in empty airplane hangars to make deals. I mean your friend decided to throw some seeds in the ground, forgot about them and now has 4 pounds of weed he needs to get rid of. Being from a legal state I cannot tell you how much free weed I get from friends. It‚Äôs like when you think you‚Äôre cooking a reasonable amount of spaghetti and next thing you know you‚Äôre the gluttony scene in ‚ÄúSe7en‚Äù.

So what about peripheral businesses surrounding pot? I‚Äôve seen a lot of talk about Akerna ($KERN) on here. Mostly people saying they‚Äôre the ‚Äúonly business of their kind in an emerging market‚Äù, etc. So have a look at their description on the website:

>Akerna consolidates cannabis technology companies to connect data points in the global cannabis supply chain. In doing so, Akerna creates one of the world‚Äôs most transparent and accountable consumer packaged goods supply chains on a global scale. We believe connected data and information will modernize and propel the cannabis industry by increasing the power of businesses, governments, patients, and consumers to make smart decisions.

This reads like an essay with a minimum word count.

Just because something is the only business of its kind isn‚Äôt a good reason it will succeed. Go find the cardboard box the guy who invented toe socks lives in and he‚Äôll tell you. If my supply side is mostly local what the fuck am I going to do with the information Akerna provides? They are a cannabis software company. A cannabis software company. Keep saying it. A cannabis software company.

How I think AMC is not worth $1,43,le38b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le38b6/how_i_think_amc_is_not_worth_1/,82,1612664164.0,"*I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks.

Hi everyone, hope you're having a peaceful Saturday. The Super Bowl is coming up, so I hope you guys in America enjoy it.

This post is for AMC, as this is what I've been playing close attention to. After doing some of my own research, I've concluded that AMC isn't worth $1 as many analysts have mentioned in their analysis, and I think it should be much higher. It all comes down to the fundamentals of the film industry.

How film studios and distributors make money is primarily based on theatre attendances. Usually, a portion of profits made from theatre tickets goes to theatre owners. The majority of the rest goes to the studio and distributor. The amount is organised through a contract between the exhibitor and the studio before the film is aired; usually, it's a 60/40 split, with 60% of the ticket revenue going to the studio. You can read more about how movies make money here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/093015/how-exactly-do-movies-make-money.asp)

As long as this fundamental is in place, the film studios and distributors will keep airing their films in theatres and cinemas. Although streaming services are the future of entertainment, they won't be able to replicate the same big-screen experience that many do enjoy. Furthermore, they won't provide the same profit margins for film studios as a regular theatre would do. It all boils down to the streaming service business model.

A prime example of this is when Disney aired the live-action film Mulan on Disney+. You had to pay the $30 early-access fee on top of the regular $6.99 per month subscription to get into Disney+. Logically, there was a big backlash behind this move, with many calling it a ""daylight robbery"". This defeats the purpose of a streaming subscription business model; the whole point is that you pay a small fee per month to gain access to a large amount of content. Having a rental that costs more than a regular rental and even more than a regular ticket, is counterintuitive to the business model.

Now take the fundamentals of the film industry into account, and it doesn't add up. If the streaming platform sets a $20-30 fee on a film, no one pays to watch it. If they set no fees at all, then the film studio won't make their money back.

So, as long as this fundamental is in place, AMC will continue making money in the future. AMC has set up private theatre rentals, screening old classics and airing new films from 2021 into 2022. And as long as big film studios advertise people to watch their movies in theatres, AMC will go on.

Now that bankruptcy is off the table, and vaccinations are ramping up, we'll slowly return to normal. I can see the stock being back to $10-20 again.

**TL;DR:** As long as film studios advertise to go to the theatres, AMC won't go anywhere.

*Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.*

Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** u/ActuaryExpert8729 commented on something that adds more to the argument that AMC will do fine. The COVID-19 Relief Package signed in December 2020 sets aside $15 billion of financial support to movie theatres and live event venues. There's probably a fund for film studios as well.

So the price definitely went down. This sucks if you are long. But remember how dejected the hopefuls were after $GME‚Äôs q3 fiasco? Not investment advice but use the current levels of palpable  despair to plan your next course of action.

I seen on the box, the bird, and the printz  that LGND was part of the WSB squeeze however other then a few post that seemed largely exaggerated. Even if it‚Äôs an industry plant it seems like a good play, maybe even a a lay up for a short term grab. Probably some value in a long term play also. 

The play 
LGND has been buying back shares for the last 3 years. Reducing total shares from 21 mil to 16 mil. Average price paid per share on the buyback was $105. The shorts are already 62% of the float which is second to GME.  However, it appears that as much 9 mil shares are owned by insiders. 5 mil shares are actually owned by Investment 10 llc since 2014. Investment 10 appears to not be very active with only a handful of sec fillings mostly signed by a management fund. This LLC being largely inactive, I believe suggests that it belongs to one of the head insiders. This is big because 30% of the float is likely owned by someone who rarely trades shares- by their filings. The 5 mil plus the other insiders is near 9 mil insider ownership. 

16 mil float - 9 mil insider shares= 7 million available 
10.01¬†M shorted (62% of 16 mil)
21 days to cover 
*Average volume 1 mil shares 


Catalyst 
LGND beat earnings and shares jumped up $22 dollars on Friday‚Äî the risk of a squeeze is more and more likely with any significant push in volume.

Background info 
If hedgies ran a pharmacy. Ligand began as a biopharmaceutical company and failed then reinvented itself as a pharmacy  investment bank and also happens to be run - to some degree by investment bankers. The company acquires early-stage drug technology, and then licenses it in a tiered royalty fee. Some of it clients uses it license while creating more early stage drug technology. Perpetual motion, I guess. For instance it‚Äôs licensing agreement some companies are not even yet profitable such as Seelos- a penny stock with 50% insider ownership that has jumped $1.94 in the last month despite recent dilution in same month and large debt- is for a mid stage parkisons treatment. 
-over $700 million in cash, Ligand is position to acquire more drugs.
-Captisol sales were $41 million compared with $7.1 million a year ago. 
-Captisol is used Veklury (remdesivir), which is approved for treating severe COVID-19 patients 

Something about this all smells fishy but profitable. I‚Äôm trusting the crooks to bring me the tendies. Smells like free money.

I‚Äôve spent some time grieving my losses and want to make sure normies with diamond hands know what they‚Äôre getting into. In the simplest terms:

Reasons why GME rocket engines will fail:

- Another gamma squeeze is very unlikely. $800 OTM calls exist for hedging. Also, this thread explains the conditions of a gamma squeeze for apes. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1kor/the_gamma_squeeze_explained_gamma_theory_for_monke/

- Short sale restrictions lift on Monday. Expect more dips until GME stabilizes at market worth.

- If short interest is still >100%, that doesn‚Äôt mean that GME will squeeze. Shorts have been short at >100% for months and the conditions for rocket launches are no longer attainable.

- Robinhood and other brokers messed up, but it‚Äôs unlikely anything will change. The reasons they gave on why they limited GME, AMc, and meme stocks are enough to appease the SEC.

- The ITM calls that expired eod Friday will not cause a gamma squeeze

- Most folks who are deep in the red are experiencing internal struggles and facing the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma, will cash out at break even, and that‚Äôs ok

Wildcards:

- If institutional share owners decided to diamond hand GME like Porsche did Volkswagen, GME would reach Pluto

- which brings up the question, why do they own >100% of available shares?

- FTDs, if they are ever investigated, would probably make something happen

- don‚Äôt know the validity of this, but apparently an emergency shareholder meeting would force all shares to be called, also forcing shorts to cover. This sounds like fake news tbh so idk.

All in all, I‚Äôm just a retard, this is not financial advice

My position: 

115 shares avg @ $403

Down almost $35k

**edit1: forgot to add, I‚Äôm diamond hands on GME, a true re t a r d hoping for a cosmic event to unleash the Squeeze of legends. I just hope that my fellow apes can come to the bleak realization that they should probably look for new plays to regain losses since the stock market is still the Wild West at this point.",2021-02-07 09:05:07

GME Institutions Likely DON'T Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze has likely Squoze,1,le8u1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le8u1s/gme_institutions_likely_dont_hold_177_of_float/,217,1612680236.0,"Y'all honestly just believe anything anyone says without looking into things for yourself.

I'll admit, I am not entirely familiar with Bloomberg Terminal but I use ORTEX and know that a shit ton of the data is usually outdated.

In the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/), OP states that ""up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings states institutions currently hold 177% of the float.""

[Bloomberg states here](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/Security-Ownership-fact-sheet.pdf) that they use a company's 13F filings to determine security ownership data.

[You can see here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-13f.asp) that 13Fs are only required to be reported quarterly and some institutions purposefully choose to hold off data until the very last day (45 days after end of quarter) to file theirs.

Meaning the main data that OP of the other post is using **is outdated** by at most 4 months.  It doesn't matter if Bloomberg says that it's updated as of today because **companies don't report their fucking trades every single day**.

It is entirely possible that when the Short Interest was at 120% 2-4 months ago that institutions held 177% of the float as that means there were 60M actual shares and 72M synthetic shares created by the shorts, and institutions only had to hold 106.2M of the 132M total.

And it is more than likely that after a shit ton of those shorts closed and a bunch of retail got trapped at a $300+ cost average that the % held by institutions will go down considerably.

[Max Pain Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp#:~:text=The%20maximum%20pain%20theory%20is,a%20case%20of%20market%20manipulation.) on even normal securities is controversial, let alone on a stock that went through a short squeeze in which all of those written puts will be hedged against.

Short Interest is also a lagging dataset but S3 and ORTEX both try to estimate it.  ORTEX does so using data from lenders, brokers and broker-dealers who submit inventory and [they believe SI is below 29M](https://imgur.com/hdMd2UL) (too lazy to get an updated screenshot but it's at 26M as of Fri).

I won't even go into the fact that [borrowing fees](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) are back down to 3.7% and Interactive Brokers has shares back that are now lendable.

I am merely sharing an opportunity I believe exists because the market has not yet come around to how BB has repositioned itself.  

There‚Äôs also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you‚Äôre interested you should search it. 

**TL;DNR why BB?**

1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles. 

2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below). 

3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won‚Äôt be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn‚Äôt understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality. 

**Don‚Äôt they make boomer phones?**

No. They don‚Äôt make *any* phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround. 

**Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)**

Software. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high. 

They are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's ""Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform"". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm‚Äôs upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO. 

19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX. **With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they‚Äôre going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.**

Amazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that‚Äôs unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?

And yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it‚Äôs making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $6.5B despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much. 

**But it‚Äôs still just a meme stock right?**

I‚Äôm not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing. 

BB got caught up with those companies because it‚Äôs viewed as wsb ‚Äòtards making nostalgic picks. *Which proves my point that people don‚Äôt yet get what‚Äôs happening with BB.*

BB is not a fling. It‚Äôs not based on a squeeze. It‚Äôs just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public). 

**Conclusion**

My girlfriend lives in Canada. She is a smoking hot model but no one knows that yet. So ima lock her up. Shares. Calls between $20-35.",2021-02-07 08:38:03

GME Guide and Common Misconceptions,41,le86o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le86o6/gme_guide_and_common_misconceptions/,49,1612678348.0,"**Gamestop Guide:**
&nbsp;

I spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding GME and its future. I am by no means a financial expert and I guess I am obligated to say this isn‚Äôt financial advice. I am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and I hate to see people get taken advantage of. I don‚Äôt know that I am 100% right, but hopefully my post helps at least one person. 
&nbsp;

**1. Was there already a squeeze?**

By definition, yes, there was a squeeze. According to the S3 Partners estimates (graph linked below), the short interest on GME fell from approximately 69 million shares on 1/13/21 to 26.39 million shares on 2/3/21. This means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions. 
&nbsp;

**2. What if the short interest data is wrong/intentionally falsified?**

More short interest data will come out on 2/9/21, but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of January. If you think S3 Partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isn‚Äôt anything that I am going to say that will change your mind.
&nbsp;

**3. Could there be another squeeze?**

There is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero.
&nbsp;

**4. What would it take to cause another squeeze?**

Since the short interest is significantly lower, it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions. Based on the short interest chart below, it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2/1/21. In order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy, GME bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares. (This was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 1/25/21 through 1/29/21 by an average daily price and adding them together. I chose 1/25/21 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now). Since the current short interest is significantly lower, it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions. 
&nbsp;

**Common Misconceptions:**
&nbsp;

**1. I lost 70+% on my GME shares. I might as well hold since it‚Äôs basically worthless.**

This is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources. There are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have. There is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments.
&nbsp;

**2. I should hold for the long play since I am down.**

Unless you purchased GME for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals, this is probably not a great idea. GME is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started (~$5 per share) and even with the new executive leadership, it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term.
&nbsp;

**3. Everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint them.**

People who are still holding GME and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions, there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money. People telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling. It is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up. It is important to think for yourself and not just hold/buy/sell because someone tells you to. Do your own research and make your own decision. This is not a family or a team, this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves.
&nbsp;

**4. I only lose if I sell.**

You lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell. The idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true.
&nbsp;

**5. I should average down by buying more shares at a lower price.**

Buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares, but it increases your exposure. If the stock continues to fall, you will lose more money.
&nbsp;

**6. We did it before; we can do it again.**

The short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying. We saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze. I agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early, however, that does not mean that it can be done again. There is no longer much media attention on GME and the attention that it is getting is not always positive.
&nbsp;

**7. What about stimulus checks, won‚Äôt that cause another squeeze?**

I would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into GME stock. The media attention isn‚Äôt there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over.
&nbsp;

**8. All the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up.**

Everyone has a price that they will paper hands at. Some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still. Some people just bought in for the first time. The paper hands traders are definitely not gone.
&nbsp;

**9. By holding, I am sticking it to the man.**

While it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you, it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares. You are not causing them extreme pain by holding. There are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to.
&nbsp;

**10. We are at (insert place) in the VW short squeeze graph.**

This information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come. The VW squeeze was very different to the GME squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading.
&nbsp;

**11. Anyone posting negatively about GME is a bot from the government or the suits.**

I‚Äôm not saying there are no bots, but this is not a real argument. A lot of people who haven‚Äôt posted on WSB before were just lurkers. The amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out.

For transparency, I believe that we have already seen the top of the GME squeeze and it will return to its old price so I have multiple GME put options. That being said, this post is not designed to make people sell or drop the price of GME, only to help people make their own decisions.

I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock‚Äôs activity. I own shares of GME.*

**TLDR:** This is currently a war between funds. Your 1.41 shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.

Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/)

The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own 88.93% of the shares. I don't know what the fuck 122.04% of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.

GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less.

Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5](https://imgur.com/a/6lH0nx5)

Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest **DAILY** on that stock at the **CURRENT PRICE**. If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make.

Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ: [https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4](https://imgur.com/a/BlQDgI4)

As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the ""squeeze.""

So the short interest goes from 102.08% to 88.58% and the price went from $35.50 to $347.51.

**Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.** I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered: [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis\_on\_why\_hedge\_funds\_didnt\_reposition\_last/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/)

**But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:**

**Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.**

Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($2.75 Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. ""The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron.""

So what's the current situation?

1) **Team A Hedge Funds:** These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy to stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.

2) **Team B Hedge Funds:** These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently ""low"" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).

3) **Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:** These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B.

What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a moron like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to ""cover,"" but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.

**And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.**

The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.

This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.",2021-02-07 08:10:27

# Sure, the data is 3 months late by now.  But so are you on your rent payments so listen up.

Looking at **BURRY's** new holdings as of last quarter, he started a üö®new positionüö® with **800,000 shares** of üí°**$LUMN**üí°

What is üí°**$LUMN**üí° you ask?  It's a merger of two boomer ass telecoms CenturyLink and Level3.  It's got the most boring, bag-inducing, 5 year chart you've ever seen.  *Translation:  many bag-holding boomers will sell you covered calls for CHEAP* ü§ëü§ëü§ë

A guide to the Moon for new investors around here.,164,le7w3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7w3f/a_guide_to_the_moon_for_new_investors_around_here/,46,1612677498.0,"This came from a conversation with a friend who's getting into the game a bit. I started trading right before Rona (Feb 23rd I picked my stocks, before J-Pow even unveiled the money machine!). I use strategies ranging from dedicated ETF portfolios to charting, and have found success in both (trading account around 130% this year). Here's some help based on what I've seen on here over the last year and the pretty significant reading I've done on investing theory-  


1. Start finding formulas that work. That‚Äôs a good way to learn a lot about different elements of a stock For example, a ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù style approach might have you look for a PB under 1 and a PE under 15, throw that in the screener (I like [https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4)) Find filters that stand out to you and google them. Play around and you'll learn what's useful to you.  

2. Cross it with some trading strats. See which the best trades are based on those Then do some real DD (personally I check the financials a bit, Google news, Reddit search, and then whatever else makes sense at the time). ""Time in beats timing"" for sure, but there's no reason not to understand what RSI is. Having more tools to make decisions with is usually a good thing, just dont use them all every time.  

3. Expect to lose some trades, but it‚Äôs the price of the lesson. Losing money isn't that bad if you stick to the rule of only investing what you can afford to lose.  

4. Things that make sense sometimes don‚Äôt actually make sense because of some absolute shenanigans. It happens. Move on and laugh it off. There's forces at play that you don't even know exist.  

5. Don‚Äôt get cocky, it makes you sloppy. Develop a system and stick to it. Do you only invest in companies with positive PE ratios? Sure, if you have a reason for it why not. Change when the evidence suggests it should, but remember to keep learning new ways to evaluate and cross check moves.  

6. Largely disregard other people‚Äôs opinions, as they‚Äôre based on their situations. Someone who just bought a house will have a very different approach than someone in college, and someone with $2k has a different approach than someone with $20k, and $200k.  

7. YouTube is really helpful, so is Reddit, but keep in mind they all have personal motives and likely already own the stock they‚Äôre talking about so they are pumping it. Not that that‚Äôs a disqualifier, but it is a factor.  

8. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be wrong. It can be a lot of fun to experiment, and 'losing money' on a lesson learned can be more valuable than a monetary gain if it helps you make better choices in the future.  

9. Once you start having significant profits, it gets a lot easier to take losses. When you can lose $1k and still be positive by a healthy percent, it‚Äôs nbd. You'll get there, be patient and consistent. $1k seemed hard, and then $10k seemed hard. They say $100k is the hardest, but it‚Äôs really just discipline. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre throwing money at garbage, and we have thought out systems guiding our decisions (develop those)  

10. The coolest thing is how it compounds. It‚Äôs actually my favorite thing in the world. The snow falls on last weeks snow and gets bigger and bigger. Eventually, there's so much snow that it causes an ice age.  

11. Other people‚Äôs limits are not yours. Just cus they can‚Äôt do it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt. This is all pretend, and literally anything is possible. Don‚Äôt get discouraged by bears, they just don‚Äôt see green. 'The crash' has been coming since April, but ""time in beats timing""  

12. Take breaks. You don‚Äôt need to make every dollar on the market, and it can deff get addicting/drive you to a breakdown since there‚Äôs so much to learn  

13. There‚Äôs a lot of noise. Tune it out and focus on your niche. You‚Äôll find what you‚Äôre good at by experimenting, and the trend changes about every two weeks, so it‚Äôs pretty fun!  

14. Knowledge is a great investment. I haven‚Äôt bought a single piece of investment literature/course that I regretted (check out One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch or Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel)  

15. For every buyer there‚Äôs a seller. Someone has the exact opposite opinion of you on every move.  

16. When listening to old wisdom, consider that the infrastructure that makes today‚Äôs trading possible wasn‚Äôt even an idea yet (discount brokers, social media trading, internet, the lack of fees). The new rules enable a new approach.  

17. Whats best for you is different than whats best for me. You need to go through the learning process to grow as a trader and investor. And there is a big difference between trading and investing. Both are viable, as they both make money, and I find using them in tandem is most effective.  

18. Lock in your profits. If you can protect your initial investment, do it.  

19. ""Get money, buy income."" Take your trading wins and roll them into safer dividend moves to lock in your victories, or open new positions! (This is for trading, buy and hold your investments. Again, there is an important difference)  

20. Please learn what a share of a company actually is, why they go up and down, and what market price actually means. This will allow you to make much more informed decisions.

Bored of GME now. I've been following Aston Martin for the last 3 months and here some DD,3,le7l2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7l2t/bored_of_gme_now_ive_been_following_aston_martin/,70,1612676546.0,"So been tracking James Bonds favorite car company for the last few months and all I can say is I'm glad I put money into it as its currently up 25%. 

Early last year the ass fell out of the company and  they almost went bankrupt. This is where the big man billionaire Lawrence Stroll entered and bought a massive stake in the company and used his contacts at Daimler Mercedes to help turn them around. 

Mercedes currently own a 5% stake in AM which will rise to 20% in the next few years. 

AM have a technical partnership with Mercedes to supply technology for engines, mechanical and electronic parts. 

They will have their own F1 team this year which is free advertising and promotion to a global audience. They are also supplying the safety cars this year instead of Mercedes. 

The head of AMG is now tasked with turning the company around. He is more than capable and with Mercedes getting a 20% stake they are not going to let it fail after all their investment. 

Stock is currently priced very low. Look at the graphs from 12 months ago before the new guys stepped in. If we get back to those levels then it would be more than a 400% increase from where we're at now. 

Their new car the DBX has been recieved very well and it caters to a new market of family friendly Aston rather than supercars. When they switch to EV they will have all Mercedes tech to play with. 

Get on board early and get into a position to get blasted on Martinis and buy some sick James Bond cars (headlight rocket launchers and ejector seats not included).

Link to Financial Times article with Tim Moers 
https://amp.ft.com/content/33613086-dbcb-4720-9805-49544200944d

Pasted from article
The brand will release 10 derivatives of existing cars within two years including two offshoots of its new DBX sport utility vehicle, as part of a planned model offensive, he told the Financial Times.

Mr Moers wants to refocus the company on engineering and bring more of its development in-house from suppliers, while working more closely with Mercedes-Benz to produce bespoke engines for the company.
Daimler, Mercedes‚Äô parent company, owns a fifth of Aston‚Äôs shares and already supplies the British carmaker with some technology.
He also plans to boost Aston‚Äôs German engineering outfit, which is based at the country‚Äôs famous N√ºrburgring race circuit.
‚ÄúOur technology partnership is there [in Germany], all the engineering suppliers are there, we should do something there to get the most efficiency out of the whole corporation,‚Äù he said.
Mr Moers was parachuted into the role from head of Mercedes‚Äô AMG, the high performance subsidiary, over the summer by Aston‚Äôs chairman Lawrence Stroll, who led a rescue of the business earlier in the year.
Mr Stroll aims to restore the marque‚Äôs luxury credentials, and has installed a team he believes will help the business begin generating positive cash by 2023.
His arrival at the company this year also coincided with a large-scale clear-out of its executive team.
As well as a new chief executive and chairman, within the last year the company has replaced almost every top flight position, including the most senior executives in finance, sales, product planning, operations, engineering and the US, its largest international market.
The company has pushed back its first battery electric model, which will now be an Aston Martin instead of a Lagonda, the luxury sub-brand that is part of the group. The company has yet to reveal its new plans for the Lagonda nameplate.
‚ÄúThe electric car has to be an Aston Martin,‚Äù said Mr Moers, ‚Äúbecause if you bring a new brand to life for electric vehicle cars, that‚Äôs wrong in my perspective.‚Äù


Edit - currently in for 28.6 shares at ¬£16.31 with more when I get paid. 

Also I'm still in for GME with a couple of shares. Managed to get out at gains of 270%.

Edit 2 - I have just been added to a controversial subreddit because this doesn't fit with your gamestonk narrative which is hilarious. Before most of you joined this subreddit it was for people to post their DD around potentially risky plays on the stock market and then post loss and gain porn not fluff peoples egos because you're balls deep in a meme stocks and latching on to optimism. The stock market is so much bigger than AMC and GME and whilst most of you are waiting for the short squeeze to happen (if it ever does) most of us who got out early enough or have spare capital like to spunk our money elsewhere.",2021-02-07 07:42:26

Just a thought...,39,le7hc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7hc8/just_a_thought/,35,1612676271.0,"First, the formalities:
Not exactly new to investing, but still going through my paces. New to WSB, fresh retard here, bough into FOMO, holding because I have nothing much left to lose. 13 shares of GameStonks @130 avg. 11 of AMC at ""idc, like $13 or something""

Now. I see so many posts about ""you only see the message the mods want you to see"" and also do many ""sell and cut your losses"" posts.
But I've also seen some well thought out DD on GME, and I have massive confirmation bias for this, seeing as I'm banking on it to go up to ""win my money back"" (money I *could* lose, but really don't want to.)
I'm not selling, I don't have too much left to lose at this point, I'd rather stay in it on the chance of a second squeeze.

But back to the main idea here: I've seen a lot of ""sell, cut your losses, reinvest"" posts. I've seen a few notably good DD's on a probable second GME squeeze.
I'll two and two together, and that adds up quite nicely with that old advice about ""buy when others are selling"".
Point is, I got into this on mob mentality and hype. I learned my fuvking lesson about that, and now I'm sitting on >50% loss. But it doesn't seem quite right to get out of this on mob mentality, right after learning that lesson.

Two reason's I'm staying and holding then:
1. I have little left to lose on this, I believe that GME fundemental are changing enough so that selling now would be at a low, which is a terrible. ""How much worse can it get?"". I'm willing to gamble what I have left for the next week or three on the DD and possible second squeeze.
2. If everyone is here for thier own gain, and everyone really IS manipulating my noobiness for thier own profit, and those same people are the ones telling me to sell, then I'm not fucking selling. I'm not selling and getting left in the dust like this. If have to die on this hill, then good luck killing me, because I already have.

I have a gut feeling that this is the dark part of the tunnel, and I'm not quitting just because I can't see the light at the other end. This is the part of the movie where all seems lost, right before the final spectacular triumph. I'm gonna be there for the end.

To all the other holders out there:

If you can pull out with gains, or at least minimal losses, then evaluate your position and decide what is best for your situation, your mental health, and your long-term stability. Don't gamble your life on a meme, even if it's more than just a meme. Keep a stock as a souvenir or a ticket to the launch, if you do decide to leave. I think you would regret selling at a loss now, but there's the chance that it could be the right decision. Either way, pull through and commit to and live with that decision. Most importantly, take away your lessons. Write them down, or tell someone else exactly how you feel right now, and what you think you should remember from this.

If you're in this like me, balls deep and waiting for the squeeze, then I think our best move is to HOLD together. I don't think that selling for substanial losses is worth it at this point. Look at it. You sell now for -50% or more, decide to take a break, put it in an index or something and it grows a measly 8%? Meanwhile, you'll be glued to GME. Imagine if it moonshots. Your realized losses might feel bad, but it will be all that much worse if just a week or even a day later it moons, and you took your losses in vain. I think the game is worth it.

Either way, I would wait for us to get numbers on the 9th, that's when we will be the best informed to make our decisions. I foresee a lot of quality DD on that data we get, so watch out for that.
Hedges seem scared, that gives me a bit of heart too. What have they to be scared of if it's all truly over?


TL;DR: 
Ignore the haters, check your fundamentals, make a realistic assessment of your situation and your risk. Wait for the data on the 9th.
If minimal losses or gains, I suggest hold, as this is probably rock bottom, and we only go up from here. But make your own decision, based on your financial stability.
If balls deep and all in, I say HOLD, and hold strong through this week.
We're in the worst part of it right now, but no one ever said it would be easy. The best things never are.

Corsair ($CRSR) DD,380,le74iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le74iq/corsair_crsr_dd/,86,1612675212.0,"Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.

This is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end.

For those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.

Earnings. Tuesday February 9th

First, a look at the previous quarter‚Äôs earnings (Q3 2020)

**Q3 2020 Highlights**

\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year

\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year

\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year

\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that‚Äôs 6.8%)

\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year

\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year

\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year

\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year

\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share

\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**

**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year

**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**

\- ‚ÄúThis last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúWe also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.‚Äù

&#x200B;

**Catalysts for Growth**

According to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),

\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.

**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.

**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020

\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.

\- According to Corsair

\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019

\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming

\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019

\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms

\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.

&#x200B;

**Market Share**

\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.

  

**Ranking of Corsair‚Äôs Total US Market Share by Product:**

**-** Keyboards: 2nd

\- Mice: 3rd

\- Headsets: 4th

\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd

\- Performance Controllers: 2nd 

\- Memory: 1st 

\- Cases: 1st 

\- Power Supply Units: 1st 

\- Cooling Solutions: 1st 

&#x200B;

**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well.

\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).

These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale

\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday‚Äôs earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion‚Äôs share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals.

\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.

&#x200B;

**Competitor Comparison**

**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech.

\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.

\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million share float (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)

"If You Don‚Äôt Know Whether The GME Squeeze Has Squoze, You‚Äôre Right",165,le726v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le726v/if_you_dont_know_whether_the_gme_squeeze_has/,66,1612675007.0,"(Disclaimer - this was a reply I posted in a previous thread - you may have already Reddit. Also not a financial advisor do your own DD)
_____________________

To those who think the squeeze has squoze and those who have not. You‚Äôre both right 

To state the obvious, last week Hedge funds were caught completely off guard and there was a massive massive gamma squeeze / short seller meltdown which crescendoed Thursday morning. 

Many are looking to the next short report to determine how squozen we truly are. Do not place too much faith in the 2/9 short report. It won‚Äôt tell you much imo. 

Why? We sat at 100% short interest for 6 months+ with no squeeze. Squeezes require catalysts and multiple catalysts are in play at the moment. 

So how do you determine if HF and others are still massively short? 

One Answer: check your own broker. Can you short the stock? Are there shares available? If cost to borrow is over 15% and/or there are no shares available - it‚Äôs a crowded short no matter what the report says. You can likely check on the weekends too. 

The current rate on IBKR is 3.7% and there are 800k shares available to borrow. This rate is lower than the previous average of ~20%. Shares available to borrow  have been anywhere from 0 to 1 million.  So IBKR to me indicates some potential covering and slightly less squeeze potential. 

But also keep in mind, if the short report says 44% of the float is short - this is still insanely high and about 2x what I would consider a crowded idea (20% is crowded imo). So don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking the covering is over even if short interest dips to lower levels. 

To me it feels like Old Wall wants the price down. Why? I‚Äôm not sure exactly. But even the dreamers on Twitter who have spent the past year pumping Tesla think GME is a bubble. Lol. People thought the Tesla bubble popped last year in Feb when it peaked at $968.99 (pre split, so actually $190 versus $850 today.  Again. People thought the Tesla bubble popped at $190.)

As for GME, Hedgeye had a $100pt. Citron covered and is scared to short. Lots of other hedgies will probabaly never pile in short to this name lest they have to explain to investors why they were burned twice. 

I don‚Äôt think RC bought at $16, risked locking up his money for a long time, simply to EaRN 5 pECEnT PeR YEar. 

Insiders haven‚Äôt sold except for one. Company hasn‚Äôt sold and is instead pumping the news flow up with Amazon hires. DFV was in at $4. He could have sold at $60 and have still been a legend.

Dr. Burry is currently - as recently as last night - been tweeting about Gamma squeezes. 

So let‚Äôs not pretend like any of us know exactly what‚Äôs going on. But uncertainty creates opportunity. 

If everyone knew we were going to squeeze again, the price would be much much higher and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy at these levels. 

This is still a highly volatile situation. In my opinion, the risks are extremely high both ways but I would be terrified to be short right now. 

Mainstream media‚Äôs mis-reporting of GMEs prospects, literal trading suppression by brokerages, threats of investigations, etc - if you just think about it - can only be doing one thing which is holding the price down. 

So to the extent GME is being manipulated at all, it‚Äôs very much to the downside imho. 

While it‚Äôs frustrating to be misunderstood by big media, big Twitter - whatever. In the end, it literally will not matter. 

The ball spiking that CNBC did to Elon and TSLA while they were down - may have felt good at the time to them. But boy did it cost them in the long run. 

And it‚Äôs not like CNBC made a mistake and then changed course overnight. They tried to FUD Tesla into oblivion through the entirety of 2020 while the price ripped in their face relentlessly. And then ripped some more. And some more. Sound familiar?

This suppression can be reversed explosively with:

More Insider Buying
New Insider Buying
Strategic Partnerships
Earnings Beat
More short covering 
Possible Gamma Squeeze Round 2 (I think unlikely)
RC memes


Speaking of Gamma squeezes - and I would love some fact checking on this - but I think one of the reasons we cannot repeat is because deep OOTM ($800) calls now exist. MM can hedge with those rather than only through purchasing shares which they had to do when every call written was a Delta 1, thus very in the money. 

But finally - an investment thesis that relies on a squeeze is not much of a thesis. It‚Äôs really a combination of A) the market realizing fundamental value is much higher all at once .... which causes B) forced short covering with limited exit paths. 

VW squeezed for purely non fundamental reasons and it came back down to earth.  I firmly believe GME ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù for fundamental reasons which could make this rally far more sustainable. Again, see Tesla. 

Just take a look at RC, e commerce valuations, and the types of $$ GME is doing. There‚Äôs value here. 

Other than all that. I have no opinion on the matter. Excuse incoherent rambling and any typos.",2021-02-07 07:16:47

The Interstellar Yoyo ‚≠êü™Ä‚≠ê,691,le6v6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/,150,1612674469.0,"Hallo all. I've been watching what's going on with great interest. There have been many things I can't explain. So I sat down and did a Think. But I know we're all just simple apes here, so why don't I tell you a bedtime story instead?

**Story Time**

Imagine there's a GME market participant, looking for a quick buck, with not the best grip on morality. I know that's a big stretch, but just go with me. We'll call him 'Snidely'.

Snidely is big into shorts, where you borrow a stock from someone, sell it immediately, and have to buy it from someone else later. But normal shorting isn't quite exciting enough for him. He wants to go naked. A naked short is when you skip that whole 'borrow' step at the beginning.

So Snidely notices that, due to [17 CFR 242.203 b 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3), he can issue a short without actually having to go through the annoyance of borrowing it, and has 13 ""settlement"" (""business"") days to actually find someone willing to lend him that stock. This is great news for Snidely! It means that he can sell a stock he made up on the spot, then look for ideal times in the next 2-3 weeks to find someone he can borrow from to un-make it. So long as the stock price even temporarily falls below his sale price sometime in the timeframe, he can make money by borrowing at that point. He just found a freakin' cheat code for cash!

And so Snidely issues the naked short sell, and sells off his newly minted ""stock"". He finds ample buyers, and has no problems with that bit. Shucks, he can actually sell a little under market level if he needs to - After all, he can always just print more stock. Hahaha, Snidely goes brrrrr.

But then the unthinkable happens. Some idiots actually buy the stock, and the price stays higher than he bought for the entire 13 settlement day period. FUCK. Now he HAS to borrow, or he loses access to his wonderful money printer, as per [17 CFR 242.203 b 3 iv](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203#b_3_iv).

So he does. And loses some money. It sucks. Oh, and the stock price went up, because he had to buy so much. And then some moronic internet forum notices him doing this, and starts to buy too. Fuck. FUCK. If this idiots actually manage to peg the stock at this level, he'll be out of a job. He might actually have to buy the cheap caviar, or whatever it is the poors eat.

So Snidely looks in his bag of tricks... and only sees one trick. And so he begins naked short selling stocks that he knows he doesn't have yet. He does it a little below market rate, because that helps cool the stock off, which helps him. He has 13 whole days for the stock price to drop, after all. He uses the money from the new shares to start borrowing shares to cover his old ones. Weirdly, the liquidity isn't as low as the numbers would suggest, and he's able to borrow enough to cover his position fairly easily.

Plot twist - Snidely isn't the only Snidely. Snidely is legion. And as each Snidely pursues this plan, the stock price drops, since they all feel comfortable selling a little below market. And while they're covering, they *buy up each other's made up stocks*.

They haven't fixed the problem. They've just moved it 13 settlement days down the road. And made it bigger.

And once one of them starts buying to cover their new position, the rest will panic and join in, and the stock will soar again.

**Evidence**

Sooo... if this story is somewhat true, what events should we have already seen?

* We should expect to see a slightly less than 13 settlement day period between stock increases, because if Snidely's wait too long they lose access to the ability to naked short. Given that GME first jumped in price on [Jan 12th](http://www.google.com/search?q=gme), then again on the 26th, that gives an 11 day period - Exactly in line with what we expect.
* We should expect to see anger and push back from wall street in that same slightly-less-than-13-settlement-day period, fading rapidly as they choose to 'cover' their positions by selling more fake shares. This is more or less exactly what we saw on this subreddit.
* Shorts should be extremely eager to tell us the closed out their positions, because they also opened new positions and NEED the stock to go back down before their time limit runs out. Yup, we sure as fuck saw that.
* We should have seen Failure-to-deliver figures high, and growing. [Yup, that's exactly what we see in GME.](https://wherearetheshares.com/)
* We should expect to see a sky-high official short rate that *isn't* reflected in third party data. We already see that in the existing data.
* We should see the SEC being uninterested in the shorts/Snidely, because no actual laws were broken by this behavior. And wow would ""uninterested in the shorts"" be a motherfucking understatement for what the SEC is up to.

**Anti-Evidence**

Some stuff doesn't fit neatly into this theory, and needs other explanations or caveats.

* Robinhood and other brokers shutting off buying is not directly explained by this. Buuuut I feel like the current explanations of increased capital requirements due to Snidely-induced volatility mostly does a fine job of explaining this.
* We shouldn't see firms resorting to illegal tactics like ladder attacks, since they can accomplish their goals legally. But every instances of a 'ladder' attack we've seen is better explained by a Snidely bulk selling naked shorts.
* The push for the fake 'Silver squeeze' is not explained by this. I think that was just an opportunistic play, rather than an actual distraction attempt.

**Predictions**

* An actual short squeeze will never happen. The Snidely's can just print more naked shorts whenever they need them.
* We should see Failure-to-deliver figures jump when the next data dump occurs. [Watch here.](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)
* We should see a growing official short interest that isn't reflected in third party figures.
* *We should expect to see a massive rise in the stock price about 11-13 settlement days after the last large stock rise. Which puts the date for expected movement around Feb 10-12*

**Conclusions**

Sorry friends, this isn't a VW-style short squeeze, infinite squeeze, or rocket to the moon. It's a fucking interstellar yoyo that's going to keep shooting up higher and higher in nearly-13 day intervals until *something* breaks.

Stock owners aren't the bag holders. The Snidely's are.

**Dirkson, what should I doo^o^o^o ?**

Oh, hell if I know. I'm not a lawyer, your lawyer, a stock dude, CPA, CFA, CFP, or whatever. I'm just some idiot who thought it was a good idea to buy two shares at $300. I wasn't even one of you before the Vast Migration, and I still don't talk right.

If you were faced 70 BILLION in the hole, losing to self proclaimed retards, autists, and degenerate gamblers you‚Äôd be doing EVERYTHING in your power to not lose.

I read a post that said this is financial warfare, we‚Äôre in WWIII right fucking now. It‚Äôs the 99% vs the 1%. It wasn‚Äôt a joke. We broke the market last Thursday and they want to keep us down. 


It will not be a big swoop, currently it‚Äôs psychological warfare - want confirmation look at any social media or main stream media. They‚Äôre either silent or telling you you‚Äôre an idiot. The hedge funds want you to sell, they want you to feel like an actual retard. Look at the Melvin citadel tropic thunder meme, look at the ‚Äúladder attack‚Äù meme. Fuck look at all the shit head memes that are not making any of us feel good. 

#hold the fucking line because this IS bigger than all of us. Realise your place in history and take part in showing Wall Street that retail investors can say what the price is at. 

These fucks are mad that you are not doing what they say and what they want to you to do. The free market was established to let the people (common people) invest in what they want & make bank collectively. 

With every decision you make comes a form of belief, which is a truth in this world. You believe in love, laughter, family yet it can‚Äôt defined by any one word sentence or photograph. The shorts -are- still higher than the float, and what the fuck are people missing here?? 
WE LIKE THE STOCK BUY THE STOCK STOCK GOES UP HOLD THE STOCK UNTIL WE FUCKING WIN. You‚Äôll know when we‚Äôve won. 

I‚Äôm fucking disgusted by what this sub has become. Infiltrated by bots, shills, provocateurs. The old crowd might never come back unless we grow a pair of balls stop wallowing in self pity and fight together like the wallstreetbets we are. 

Please think for yourself. Do not yolo your life savings in hopes it will rocket to the moon, do not put yourself at risk of losing the little stability you‚Äôre holding onto right now in hopes this will be your light in the glory hole tunnel. 

But if you can... Do you want to stick it to the people who said ‚Äúhell is coming‚Äù and then made BILLIONS of dollars off the little people??? Do you want to fight for the people who worked 20 years day and night to grow their restaurant, ma and pa retail stores who are locally owned??? Fucking fight for all of those people. The situation seems absolutely ludicrous and ridiculous that THIS RIGHT HERE is our fight, but do not get confused or allow the media to gaslight you. We DID break the market, we did make every single hedge fund shit their pants but this fight isn‚Äôt fucking over. 

You need to dig deep as this is emotional, hope is emotional, making a change and defeating a bully is hard as fuck. LOOK AT EPSTEIN. Guilty as mother fucking sin. We don‚Äôt even have a mother fucking answer about that one. 


You think the people in charge are just going to give up? That they won‚Äôt pull every single dirty, manipulative, callous, petty, illegal trick in the book to make sure a bunch of autists and retards lose it all??? Fucking wake up and ask yourself where you want to be next week, a year from now. Do you want to look back 20 years and feel like you got fucked in the ass?? Fuck no. It‚Äôs that simple. Hold the fucking line and make sure everyone else does the same (within reason!!) or we deserve the royal ass fucking these elites give you every single day, stroking it to the loses you took in 08.

Okay so, hear me out...

O.G. Shareholder Hold All 100 shares and refuses to sell (there is zero market liquidity, zero supply to even one buyer = infinite demand to supply ratio; share price skyrockets)

Short Seller borrows 50 shares to sell to the market (liquidity emerges, supply and demand becomes a rational ratio, prices stabilize)

O.G. Shareholder buys 'new' shares directly from the market (all 50, s/he is willing to pay the price to get every share out of the market's hands).

Original shares = 100

Borrowed shares = 50

O.G. Shareholder = 150 Shares

Then O.G. shareholder calls the 50 borrowed shares back... and refuses to sell.

Is this something that can happen? And if so, what is the absolute cheapest stock on the market (market-cap-wise, I mean) that allows options trading?

Asking for a friend.
_______________________

*edit: Seems like if a company is 100% owned by a single investor it is no longer a publicly owned company, and would get delisted. This still raises two questions:

1) What happens if there are already short sold shares out there floating and someone just buys up enough shares to own 100% of the company. Do the shares then get called back in order to delist the company? Does the company simply get delisted with one individual owning more shares than originally existed?

B) How many people would have to own 100%, collectively, in order for this to occur ""organically"" within the market (at which point the company does NOT get delisted)? Obviously y'all are gonna be like 'cOlLuSiOn iS iLlEgAl"" but yeah like we haven't seen plenty of collusion and no one got sent to jail for it. One of y'all said it best on another thread: SEC fines are just budgeted in.

A case for going long on $LUV (Southwest Airlines),26,le6grc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6grc/a_case_for_going_long_on_luv_southwest_airlines/,31,1612673317.0,"Heyo WSB

Forgive the degenerate writing, I just like this stock and want others to know about it. 

**What is Southwest Airlines?** 

**Southwest Airlines Co.** is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier.  The airline was established on March 15, 1967, by Herb Kelleher as **Air Southwest** Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

Southwest operates a leisure-focused low-cost carrier, **which is well-positioned for a leisure-led post-pandemic recovery in aviation**.  Southwest has generally been able to achieve low-cost carrier unit expenses and passenger yields close to legacy carrier levels.  **Southwest‚Äôs focus on providing low fares could allow it to make inroads with business travel in the current recessionary environment.**

**Why get in now?**

1.  **CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion on Shares of Southwest Airlines Co.**

* ""We lift our target to $53 (from $48), 20x our 2022 EPS estimate (raised to $2.79 from $2.66; 2021 unchanged)."" 
* Q4 adjusted EPS of -$1.29 vs. $0.98 beat consensus by $0.39. 
* Revenue fell 65% Y/Y in Q4 as the pandemic continued to depress air travel demand. **Yet, despite the quarter‚Äôs major resurgence of Covid-19, which led to new travel restrictions and business closures, LUV‚Äôs revenue grew 12% vs. Q3.** Such strong sequential revenue growth in this harsh environment suggests that there is significant pent up air travel demand. We think this demand will start to be unleashed this Spring as vaccines become widely distributed, allowing LUV to soundly beat revenue and EPS estimates for 2021. 
* Additionally, despite the unprecedented demand weakness, **LUV has maintained a strong balance sheet with negative net debt throughout the pandemic.** 
* Manageable debt, strong customer loyalty, and efficient operations will lead LUV to be the first major airline to recover profitability, in our view, which we expect midway thru Q2. 

[ For the first quarter 2021, analysts estimate LUV will earn -$1.90 non-GAAP per share, a decrease of 1,168.00&#37; over the prior year first quarter non-GAAP results. ](https://preview.redd.it/nfs70jt76xf61.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de9a23e3ff7d48c85c818d94c6272ec13ff2ab)

2.  Southwest has used the pandemic as an expansion opportunity, adding 14 new destinations since March 2020.   Overall, the 14 new destinations added or announced by Southwest since March 2020: 

* Chicago O‚ÄôHare (ORD)
* Houston Bush Intercontinental (IAH)
* Jackson, Mississippi (JAN)
* Savannah, Georgia (SAV)
* Miami and Sarasota in Florida
* Fresno (FAT), Palm Springs (PSP) and Santa Barbara (SBA) in California
* Colorado Springs (COS), Montrose/Telluride (MTJ), and Steamboat Springs (HDN) in Colorado
* Cozumel (CZM) in Mexico. 

&#x200B;

[$LUV recovery is going well as the pandemic persists.   Massive demands for travel coming in March... Summer of 2021 will be a record for air travel... Thanksgiving and Christmas will be off the charts... ](https://preview.redd.it/4k8twynv4xf61.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=574a353ca0e66a0ff9a841319fa0b29641e3e481)

3.  Passenger traffic is likely to be severely depressed until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed.

* Southwest no longer operates only Boeing 737 aircraft.  Unit expenses are likely to decrease, as the 737 MAX is recertified (as of November 18th, 2020).
   * LUV is the king of US domestic air travel and has the strongest balance. 115 million Americans will be fully vaccinated by Summer, another 100 million by end of Summer. These 215 million will be living life like 2019. The other 115 million by New Years. LUV will be back to 2019 peaks in 2022. **Buy now for the bargain pricing. It will be a bumpy flight for a while, but calm and smooth in 2022.** 
* Ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, show that the leisure market can serve consumers that are particularly cost-conscious.

Short sellers may have doubled down on GME since the big rally to $300+. Here's a list of evidence that brought me to that conclusion:,4771,le622q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le622q/short_sellers_may_have_doubled_down_on_gme_since/,452,1612672143.0,"**#1: GVIP has dominated the S&P 500 in performance over the last week**

Some context:

GVIP is an ETF that tracks popular hedge fund long bets.

Below is a chart that compares the 5 day performance of the GVIP ETF vs the S&P 500.

https://preview.redd.it/1h510wt7zwf61.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=492289c4e6f30184c160a133188a3e9331e17f7d

Over the last week (Friday last week to Thursday this week) GVIP has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2.3%. That's a TON. Furthermore if you do the same comparison for Monday this week to Thursday the outperformance of GVIP rises to approximately 4.4%, for Monday-Friday the outperformance was 2.3%

To put this into perspective look at the historical performance of these two side by side since Jan 1st 2017 (essentially inception of GVIP) and you can see that GVIP in the past has modestly outperformed the s&p 500 with GVIP returning on average (roughly) 1.69% per month and the S&P 500 returning on average (roughly) 1.12% per month (A total of 127% gain for GVIP and a 73% gain for S&P 500 over \~49 months). 2%+ out performance over a short period of time (a week or less) is massive variance to the long term monthly averages.

My hypothesis here: Hedge funds have been increasing short bets (on gamestop and other stocks) and plowing the cash they are receiving from the short sales into their favorite stocks. This pumps GVIP higher explains some of the difference in short term performance

**#2: Short Volume has increased as a percent of total volume**

First up its important that I note the different between short VOLUME and short INTEREST. Short volume refers to the number of shares sold/bought in short trades each day. Short interest is the total outstanding number of shorted shares.

A large increase in short volume as a percent of total volume indicates that something is going on. As you can see from the chart below this new activity started on 12/27 (the day that gamestop had the highest price) and continued. While its hard to tell what is actually going on here it looks like there has been a paradigm change

My thesis/opinion: Short sellers have been doubling down with the recent price increases. A combination of a high amount of short selling (as a percent of total volume) and lower liquidity is fueling the current price drop

**#3: Price changes in gamestop stock seem to be strategically timed with short interest reports**

Every 15 days the SEC requires shorts sellers to report their positions. This information is then made public 7 days later. It just so happens that 1/29 was the reporting date for short interest (to be published 2/9). I've placed 4pm on 1/29 on a chart of gamestop below:

&#x200B;

My opinion: Short sellers want to give the impression that they closed their positions - so that we get paper hands. To do this they exited (or pretended to exit by substituting their positions for naked sold call options) leading up to the reporting deadline. Now they may have started to re-enter those positions

**#4: Anecdotal evidence**

4a: People have been posting screencaps to this subreddit that shows overwhelming good sentiment for gamestop stock. One of the things I've seen pop up on this sub lately is the total volume of buy/sell orders from retail brokerages. These have been skewing very positive still. If its not the retail investors selling, then it must be institutions either exiting long positions or starting new short positions

4b: The diamond hands on WSB are real, and sentiment has been fairly positive (despite sub drama, and a massive price drop)

4c: It appears there is a continued effort to spread disinformation and to keep the stock price down. Anyone seen those advertisements for silver lately? Why would someone go to all this effort if short positions have been exited?

4d: S3 partners estimate of short interest (as of about 7pm on 2/4) is around 26MM shares (see below). This is down from the official short interest number on 1/15 of 61MM shares. If we truly underwent a short squeeze, would half of them still be here?

https://preview.redd.it/f9j635jt0xf61.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9581436ed635e04f42f0e261350d0a7963a18ba

**#5: Interactive Brokers Short Interest Data on 2/5**

On Friday (2/05) morning we experienced a big jump in gamestop's stock price (to around $82 by 10am). Around the same time the short share availability dropped over 1MM shares at interactive brokers for gamestop.

[The first column is the borrowing cost, second column is number of shares available](https://preview.redd.it/vc38orqv1xf61.png?width=380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b86977a889343bd18c9b01d56d22ec6d33d01a)

My Thesis: While short share availability can drop for a number of reasons (and there is no requirement to immediately sell borrowed shares) its my opinion that that someone borrowed a bunch of shares from interactive brokers and shorted the morning's spike which halted momentum in the stock price

\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR:

My opinion: What we experienced the other day was a half baked short squeeze, the game isn't over and shorts are still playing. However, these shorts may have taken positions at higher prices and lower borrowing rates (see above screenshot) and therefore may be harder for gamestop to shake.

Anyways, I don't think I'm the only one that thinks the story is getting a bit complicated. There are those that say hold and those that say sell. 

Forgive me if I'm waaay off but I've never even dabbled in stocks, but I don't think I'm completely hopeless. Correct me if I'm wrong here:

* The shorts that hedgfunds were holding have already been sold right? Because robinhood forced the price to go down so that the hedge funds could minimize their loses before they were forced to sell. I assume the shorts were sold as MSM are reporting the losses at 50billionish. I guess I'm asking if the squeeze is still going on or if it happened and now there is another squeeze going to happen or what?

* If that's right why are people on WSB still holding?? Also with people cashing out which I don't see as bad, because the whole point was the screw over the %1 and take that money from them put it in our pockets, I would assume right now is the best time to short. Right??

What the F is share lending? üöÄüöÄüöÄ,17,le5oaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le5oaw/what_the_f_is_share_lending/,9,1612671001.0,"I read several comments and posts across reddit talking about not lending your GME shares for shorting. But there seems to be a lot of misinformation or lack of understanding around this topic. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but only what it is. 

Most proper brokerages have share lending programs, which you have to sign up for and only then they can lend your shares for shorting. In return you get a part of borrowing fee, which differs based on short interest. These programs may have different but similar names in different brokerages such as fully paid security lending (ally) but are available in most brokers.

One of the biggest condition for the program is that security should be fully paid i.e. not on margin. Now we know most of retail shares of a particular popular stock are not on margin anymore. 

Brokers need to place a security cash deposit for you when borrowing your stocks since during lending you dont get SIPC protection on your stocks. 
~~A little conspiracy theory here, during a short squeeze brokers that have lent out shates would be killed for that security cash requirement. So that explains why they want to avoid squeeze.~~

Anyway, Is it possible that you have signed up for such a program without knowing? Yes, and that you can check by simply calling broker and asking about the program and telling to opt out of it.  You can also google ""your brokerage"" ""share lending program"" to find out what fancy name your brokerage has given, so you dont sound retard when calling them to opt out of it. 

One catch though- wsb favorite Robinhood doesnt have any such program, meaning they can and they will lend out your security without your permission and without sharing any borrowing fee/interest with you.

Question 1: Why is Biocryst (BCRX)'s Berotralstat not priced in at all!?,295,le5jai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le5jai/question_1_why_is_biocryst_bcrxs_berotralstat_not/,82,1612670617.0,"This post comes directly from u/bio9999 .. If you are interested in some amazing DD - give him a follow. Also, we actually have our very own subreddit so please feel free to take a look there as well for all the DD you could ever want and need! r/bcrx üíéüöÄ

&#x200B;

First we are going to look at **Biocryst‚Äôs** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks. The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track**status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that **98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment**.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/)

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market**based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. The **UK** is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave **early access to the drug on November 9th**. [https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:\~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat‚Äôs biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow **R8** or **nickpd** on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. **Optime care** even lets patients get **direct-to-patient** prescriptions now ([https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks)). So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**! And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that \*\*its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,\*\*and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**... The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

he didn't sold at 420 and im sure glad he didn't because i believe they could have gone after him.

now for the ape that diamond hand and all that, please still hold. i love that stock for real and i wanna see gamestop succeed in the future. i could spend hours in that store when i was younger and i can see a brick and mortar store opened in big cities with a good chunk of online retails. who knows .. they could become the amazon of games.

What happens when people buy the wrong stock...Over and Over...and cause a short to panic!,17,leak38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leak38/what_happens_when_people_buy_the_wrong_stockover/,11,1612685391.0,"So the Canadian stock Green Thumb Industries Inc. Which trades under the symbol GTII on the Toronto stock exchange has gotten a lot of attention lately due to legal weed. Well that stock trades as GTBIF on U.S. exchanges in U.S. dollars. The U.S. Stock GTII is a dirt cheap penny stock that is Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. Well, when I was looking to buy Green Thumb a few days ago I accidentally found myself looking at Global Tech...Which led me to wonder how many others might make this mistake. It turns out a LOT of people. Now what happens when volume spikes massively on a gently shorted over time penny stock? Well the short at first doubles  up thinking it's free money.

 However, when you get multiple days of spiking volume the short probably starts to panic. Imagine you've shorted millions of shares of a podunk stock with 50K a day volume and suddenly people are buying it up? You're going to burn.

I've been watching this. I got in at $0.24...and then got out thinking it was over...But no, I got back IN for bigger and more! So Friday it closes up 115% at $0.86 with over 2,000,000 shares traded.

The shorts (me picking up things desperately from the ground) already know that they're fucked, and you can already guess what getting dragged up forcefully means (us apes buying shares).

In the case that I'm correct, I'm a fucking sage. In the case that I'm incorrect, I can just laugh it off in the end with you guys.

Selling means you are saying ""No"" to the future, you are letting the past define you.

"Please enjoy my loss story, featuring TSLA, shorting, options, one too many Negroni‚Äôs and my perfectly smooth ape brain.",54,leids1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leids1/please_enjoy_my_loss_story_featuring_tsla/,23,1612714046.0,"Some of you may enjoy this, and writing it down will hopefully ease my pain a bit. It‚Äôs nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.

Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$). 

Move ahead two months and it‚Äôs a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.

Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.

So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don‚Äôt really read, and click submit... aaaand that‚Äôs when my stock position vanished.

I had closed the wrong position.ü§¶üèª Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss‚Äôed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.

After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it‚Äôs not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.

Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.

1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake.
2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled.
3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit
4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.

So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. ü§¶üèª

The moral: don‚Äôt drink and trade (+my Negroni‚Äôs are awesome). Anyways, I‚Äôll use that excuse, but my smooth lazy ape brain likely would have done so anyhow.

On Feb 19 2020, pre pandemic - SABR traded at $22.36, 78% above it's closing price of Feb 5 2021. On Feb 4th 2021, SABR closed at $12.82, a price not closed above since the beginning of the pandemic - March 4, 2020. It has been trading sideways for awhile now in a channel, and is starting to see some traction and large prints in recent days. I think this is telling, and SABR will continue it's move upward from here. it briefly touched $13.10 at Feb 5th open.

With 317M outstanding shares, the 62M shares short are not super significant, however, there is 102% institutional ownership, and demand for the stock will only increase as the recovery beings to show signs of really happening.

Recent 13F positions show institutional ownership of 410M shares, excluding the 13Gs. so uh, that's 40M more shares than shares outstanding, perhaps that's where the 60M shares shorted come into play also. Not to mention all the owners that aren't required to submit 13F forms. Not to mention call and put positions which I can't see. I know they can play with the dates they submit a bit here, I think overall it's positive data for the stock listed here.

They spent the pandemic upgrading their technology stack and appear to be hiring aggressively.

All in all, it appears we're on the path to recovering from the pandemic, with vaccines being pushed out, and a pent up demand for travel. This stock is in a great position that even if it only halfway fills the gap between today's close and it's where it was before the pandemic dive, you're still looking at a 40% upside from where it sits. I think that is extremely likely to happen in 2021.

Why I'm not leaving Robinhood. And why I hate/love Robinhood.,0,lehn1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehn1x/why_im_not_leaving_robinhood_and_why_i_hatelove/,23,1612710514.0,"I was pretty pissed off when RH blocked buying of the meme stocks.  $GME, $BB, $NOK.  But for a different reason than most.

$GME:

I caught the train late.  4 shares.  Bought and sold in the same hour.  Made about $400.  (I'm shocked that people bought at $360.  I've bought some stocks at the top of the rollercoaster before.  But DAMN son, never have I bought a stock that was obviously nuts).

$BB:

Bought some, after seeing the noobs jumping all in.  I set up a stop-loss and my stock sold at a small loss.  If RH wouldn't have froze the stock my stop-loss wouldn't have triggered and I'd have $400 in profit.

$NOK:

Invested (repeat, INVESTED) in $NOK back in October when news broke about the deal with NASA.  Not selling this one for some time.  I have no idea why $NOK was even considered to be the same shit as $GME.

&#x200B;

I was pissed at RH because my stop-loss triggered.  But only slightly.  I was really pissed off because I started the day off intending on buying a PUT $GME.  Cause the bubble was going to burst.  I don't think RH froze trading because of some conspiracy BS.  And I don't really care (because the game is rigged, always has been).  RH probably stopped the trading due to not having the assets to cover the trading.  Not to mention their servers fuck up all the time (they can't handle trade volume at a stupid level).

&#x200B;

I'm switching my main broker over to WeBull.  (I opened up an account with the 4 month ago, just never used it).  The tools they offer and the trading hours are far better.  Downside, they don't offer trading for OTC stocks.

I'm staying with RH (why I love RH)

* so I can gamble on shitty OTC stocks like $RYCE.
* They offer instant deposit and settlement free.
* The interface is good looking.
* They are an American made company.
* I can gamble on fake money.

Why I hate RH:

* The platform always crashes (trade volume too high)
* The app always resets my login time restriction with each update (I hate having to login after a 5min wait)

PSA for the 7 million new subs:

* If you're triggered by words like Retard, you should probably leave.
* If you don't know much about options, stay the fuck away from them.  (I dabble.  If you want to actually invest stick to stocks that pay dividends and have a good history/future.  If you want to gamble try pennystocks.  They are fun.)
* If you have to ask:  Did I miss the train?  You have...
* $GME is not going to rocket again.  Take the loss.
* Don't buy the hype.  Exploit the hype.

$GME is not going to rocket again.  We got one up on the big dogs.  I always wondered if it would be possible to hype a stock so much that it would get to the level of $GME.  But, learned that directing the hive mind is like trying to heard cats.

&#x200B;

The big dogs have already changed their strategy.  They will recover.

&#x200B;

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  One day r/wallstreetbets will be banned at the federal level.

&#x200B;

Other thoughts on RH stopping trading:

* They stopped the use of margin for buying $GME and etc.  Which is something that actually did protect the end users. 
* If the buying frenzy continued their shitty servers would have gone up in flames.  Happens every time a stock goes crazy.
* This was not a freeze on trading for a moral reason.  (legit reasons to freeze trading, example:  Lukin Coffee)",2021-02-07 17:08:34
SNDL DD - 2/6/21,858,lehg4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehg4a/sndl_dd_2621/,252,1612709640.0,"Sundial is a Canadian cannabis company üå± that has shown a lot of bullish trends lately. I wanted to share some DD as recent technical and fundamentals bullish trends have developed:

‚Ä¢ SNDL management team effectively manages its cash balance üíµ through registered offerings. The Company has ~$600M in cash with essentially no debt. This means they are poised for strategic growth with low liquidity risk. 

‚Ä¢ Political and Macro trends are favoring legalization in the US (~25B  annual market opportunity by 2023) with legalization being brought to the senate we can potentially see this market open up for SNDL by 2022-2023. 

‚Ä¢ GWPH was just acquired by Jazz Pharma for ~$7B - companies and investors are taking notice that cannabis is not just recreational, medicinal market is massive. üåé

‚Ä¢ If the company retains above ~$1 for ~5 days then it meets listing requirements for NASDAQ, super bullish signal. üìà

‚Ä¢ The call to put ratio is 5:1. Literally 5 calls for every put being bought. This is super bullish because the buying interest will continue to rise. üôåüèºüíé

‚Ä¢ Investors are hungry for this stock, even with the outstanding shares recently issued; they barely made a dent in the stock price. ü§§ 

Speculation: 45M shares were traded on Friday in two seconds (2/5) this was either a massive buyer coming in or a massive short position being covered. Regardless, some whales have taken notice. üê≥üöÄüå±üìà

I'm all in here, ~500 shares + over $1000 invested in long dated calls .05-1 strikes. $5 PT (200% increase) by EoM.

Edit: THANKS FOR THE GOLD! :)

Edit 2 (2/10/21): I'm getting a lot of requests asking if you should buy SNDL. Here's my response: I'm invested for the long run, I've been buying every dip and will continue to do so going forward. I'm officially upgrading my Price Target from **$5 > $13.** üöÄ",2021-02-07 16:54:00

Bloomberg: Robinhood Traders Have a Troubled Track Record of Stock Picking,4,lehbh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehbh9/bloomberg_robinhood_traders_have_a_troubled_track/,27,1612709036.0,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-traders-have-a-troubled-track-record-of-stock-picking?srnd=premium)

&#x200B;

Back in May, a Reddit poster hit WallStreetBets with a sure-thing tip on Scorpio Tankers Inc. The oil shipper, trading at one-fifth the value of its assets, was a screaming buy with storage rates soaring, insiders leveraging up and oil vaulting back after briefly going negative.

&#x200B;

There‚Äôs an opportunity to see ‚Äú100% returns within the next year,‚Äù the user said.

&#x200B;

Eight months later, the reward: a 17% loss.

&#x200B;

Another WallStreetBets poster was similarly breathless about their bright idea to short Tesla Inc. in 2018. The outcome: a 1,330% loss, not including borrow fees, assuming they stuck with it.

&#x200B;

Picking stocks is hard. Almost nobody has an edge, and it‚Äôs no mark of shame when a call fails to pan out.

&#x200B;

But in all the hagiography being bestowed on Reddit traders who latched on to GameStop Corp. before it rocketed skyward, it‚Äôs worth remembering that a big enough sample of predictions will always yield a few winners. Evidence of investing genius elsewhere is hard to find.

&#x200B;

It is these cautionary tales on stock-picking that are documented in research covering this era of WallStreetBets. A new paper finds that on average when retail traders on Robinhood Markets buy a stock, it doesn‚Äôt perform better over the next three to 20 days.

&#x200B;

In fact, it tends to do a little worse.

&#x200B;

A speculator's record trading GameStop would depend on their timing

‚ÄúRobinhood investors‚Äô evident lack of skill in aggregate is consistent with commission-free investors behaving as uninformed noise traders,‚Äù wrote Gregory W. Eaton and Brian S. Roseman from Oklahoma State University and T. Clifton Green and Yanbin Wu from Emory University.

&#x200B;

The authors also found that stocks with buzz on WallStreetBets see a spike in activity on Robinhood a few days later, a sign there‚Äôs likely much overlap between the two communities.

&#x200B;

To isolate investment skill, the academics adjusted 2020 returns for recent price moves and risk factors like valuations and the size of a company. The upshot: When you strip out the possibility that these traders are simply chasing market trends, they don‚Äôt actually end up picking future winners.

&#x200B;

The results don‚Äôt mean retail investors across all brokerages are bad stock pickers. In fact, the four scholars found that increased buying of a company‚Äôs shares by the group overall did predict higher future returns. The problem for the Robinhood contingent is that they typically pile onto a stock nearly a week after the bulk of their peers.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúAlthough retail traders in aggregate appear to invest in the same types of securities that are popular among Robinhood investors, we find that the broader measure of retail trading leads Robinhood trading by several days, which may help explain the difference in performance,‚Äù the authors wrote.

&#x200B;

The research covers only the first eight months of last year because Robinhood stopped publicizing the number of users holding each stock in August.

&#x200B;

To be fair to Robinhood, it seems likely the pattern is not limited to their platform. Another paper has shown smartphones in general make people more likely to buy risky assets and chase past returns -- partly because apps allow them to trade in the evening without thinking too much.

&#x200B;

Bragging Rights

As the GameStop rally comes back to Earth, the new research may offer a gut-check to amateurs whose bragging rights over the past week reached fever pitch.

&#x200B;

Yet plenty of them would take issue with its conclusions, given how many in this new investing generation appear to have minted fortunes while besting hedge funds -- largely empowered by zero-commission trading platforms.

&#x200B;

When markets were lashed by Covid in the roughly six months through July 2020, a portfolio comprising the most popular stocks on the Robinhood app returned an annualized 105%, according to Wolfe Research.

&#x200B;

GameStop Corp., the poster child of retail speculation, is still more than 238% higher this year even after its recent plunge. Throw in Sundial Growers Inc. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and the Robinhood crowd would seem to have several stories of incredible success.

&#x200B;

The phenomenon remains relatively young, so firm conclusions about the stock-picking skills or otherwise of those involved might be premature. And to the speculators who have reaped profits on these platforms, it may not matter much whether it was down to picking winners or following the momentum of the market.

&#x200B;

The success of retail traders in general has been documented by various academics across different time frames and methods. In a paper last year, Ivo Welch, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed a portfolio of common Robinhood holdings beat market benchmarks and a quant factor model in the two years through mid-2020.

&#x200B;

Welch‚Äôs work focused on stocks widely owned by users, rather than those seeing an increase in buying on the platform. The recent paper focused squarely on whether more purchases from the Robinhood crowd actually led to superior performance -- or not.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúOur evidence suggests that zero-commission investors in aggregate behave as noise traders, with changes in Robinhood ownership being unrelated to future returns,‚Äù the academics wrote.",2021-02-07 16:43:56
Why in long on MNKD,10,lehaem,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lehaem/why_in_long_on_mnkd/,7,1612708904.0,"(credit to u/yoyo_mas_cousin)

Years ago, while holding a true medical breakthrough MNKD who has an amazing inhaled insulin, they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps. They pretended that A led to B and it was all a natural process, when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with BS FUD. Seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game.


There used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable (from SEC data) and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to MNKD but other favourites they used to attack.


Difference with GME is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90% losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar.


Sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process, and I believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share, down 95% plus. The naked short selling rule was called the ""madoff exception"" because Bernie madoff helped get the rule in place ""to help provide liquidity to the market""


Since then, the markets have been completely rigged, and it doesn't matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down. They just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying. GME should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed, that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise.


MNKD still kicking after all these years and seems to be finally winning the war, but the majority of shorts already closed out after whacking the stock 95%+. Good luck traders, always check to see if your stock is a Wall Street darling or a Wall Street target, the little guy can't swim up stream.",2021-02-07 16:41:44

Revisiting My Favorite È¶¨: $PDD,39,legvc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/legvc2/revisiting_my_favorite_È¶¨_pdd/,34,1612707035.0,"$PDD, or PinDuoDuo, is the stock that I like more than any other stock on the market based on fundamentals and macroeconomics. I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced.

Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options.

Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again.

# What is PinDuoDuo

PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\* Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla. üòÇ\*\*

**By the numbers:**

Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB 14.2 BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market.

Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors.

&#x200B;

1.There is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same.

On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of  food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition.

2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why. [Lots of companies are working with them](https://agencychina.com/blog/pinduoduo-for-china-cross-border-e-commerce/) for cross-border social commerce. The retail market for overseas Chinese with family in China is well in the Trillions RMB. Wall Street just missed here.

3. PinDuoDuo dominates in China's 2nd and 3rd Tier cities. [Tier 1 cities like Shanghai have experienced slowed growth](http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2020-11/10/content_76895684_10.htm), while PDD increases penetration there anyway. Seeing as China is posted the best performing economy of any of the major economies by far, it seems that this fact is more important than the market has realized.

4. Amazing technology. Here is where I laugh my ass off at the Morningstar's of the world. They don't know shit about how hard it is to build good software. PinDuoDuo's software has an amazing track record and they are very focused on improving the customer experience constantly. Customer experience is the differentiator for the business.

5. Not a short squeeze you have to catch the run up or any of that. I like the stock for several years. I expect the company to be the largest retailer in China, the world's second largest retail market and growing rapidly, by the end of 2021.

6. Gradually reducing the cash burn from marketing spend. The reason why PinDuoDuo has only posted a single profit is because of the need to quickly acquire customers in a very competitive and fast growing market. Their reliance on marketing spend is dropping rapidly as they start to win more and more customers through brand loyalty and reputation. Their product is very sticky, social, and nurtured by social network density. We can expect a monster earnings report of 3/10.

My Bullish Price Target: $375

I am basing this on an aggressive revenue multiple that compares their 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous **290%**. If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also  paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock.

&#x200B;

My Bearish Price Target:  $235

The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data  can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation.

Positions:

\~$100 C Jan 22

&#x200B;

\~$250 C Jan 22

If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time.

Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point.

I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.

But more importantly, this two step approach allows me to enjoy two of my favorite things: (1) panic buying like a true WSB autist, and (2) justifying my YOLO ***after the fact*** with actual logic, reason, and of course, our favorite‚Äînumbers! I call it *The Way of the Autist.*

So, now that you have already leveraged everything and dumped your life savings into TIGR after seeing the **TL;DR**/**Positions** above, you have completed the first step of *The Way of the Autist*.

To be clear, if after seeing the **TL;DR**/**Positions** above, you thought to yourself, ""if Lieutenant [u/Brassmonkeynutzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Brassmonkeynutzz/) made money, I can too because APES TOGETHER STRONG ü¶çüçåüíéü§öüèªü§™"" then you belong here. If you immediately panic bought before you read the actual text of this post, you belong here. If you cannot read this at all, you belong here. However, if you are still reading and have not invested in TIGR yet, it is likely too late, and you should consider an ETF instead.

**2.** **RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH AURORA MOBILE LIMITED WILL GENERATE FURTHER GROWTH:**

&#x200B;

On January 5, 2021, Aurora Mobile, a leading mobile developer service provider in China, ""announced that it has entered into a partnership agreement with UP Fintech Holding Limited (NASDAQ: TIGR)."" [Source 1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurora-mobile-partners-leading-online-090000290.html).

&#x200B;

**3.** **RECENT INSTITUTIONAL BACKING FROM A NOTORIOUS SHORT SELLER:**

&#x200B;

On February 2, 2021, Kerrisdale Capital who has a reputation for making ""successful bets against Chinese internet companies, came out with a long position in"" TIGR, calling it ""The Robinhood of China."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html) (great article for any of you that actually know how to read).

&#x200B;

Now, I know what you are thinking: FUCK ROBINHOOD. I absolutely agree. The mass fraud that they perpetrated on the retail market with GME, AMC, BB, etc. is an absolute travesty. But the point here is, TIGR has insane revenue and user growth and is continuously expanding its business according to available data and information. It's platform is user friendly and is attracting a lot of attention from retail investors, institutional investors, and start up companies seeking to go public via an IPO.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

&#x200B;

TIGR is the next big trading platform that global, individual and institutional investors are showing an increasing interest in. It has the potential to continue its growth trajectory based purely on its impressive numbers, which speak for themselves.

&#x200B;

Also, I believe TIGR will continue to gain international interest in light of the recent media spotlight on retail trading. Interestingly, the ""government mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have helped fuel a surge in online trading . . . ."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html). And even though you might not expect it, ""Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other U.S. trading app last week despite concerns about its restrictions on transactions."" [Source 5](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-seller-kerrisdale-goes-long-203153793.html).

&#x200B;

**SUMMARY:** Getting into TIGR now is like getting in on sunlight before there was fucking sunlight.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR AGAIN:** TIGR --> üíéüôåüèªüë®‚ÄçüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüìàüìàüìàüí∞üí∞üí∞

They are also profitable, with a profit margin in Q3 of over 11%. Cyclically Q4 has always been bad so I can see a dip buy after earnings. ( see their 2019 Q4 for reference )

Their Q3 income was 475.56 million, I don‚Äôt expect Q4 to be that strong and it‚Äôs very possible that they post a - EPS due to Q4 and the start of Q1 being the ‚Äúoff season‚Äù for golf (unless you are a boomer in retirement who lives in Florida). the golfing industry is a 80+ billion dollar industry and $ELY is poised to continue to capture the lions share of money that is spend on non venue purchases. Sporting and recreation will see more people as we exit COVID, and I predict a great year for the company after earnings on the 10th. This stock has the ability to grow to 38$ a share by the end of the year. Buying golf balls, and clubs is a necessity to golf, you can‚Äôt play without them. (Unless you get creative). Every time someone shanks a shot into a pond $ELY has the chance to sell another golf ball. For every new young businessman who has to go golfing with his boss for the 1st time that‚Äôs a new set of clubs that get purchased ( or rented if the venue offers that ). As long as the game grows, which it is,( rounds of golf logged in 2020 increased by almost 20%, and female interest in the game has started to pick up ) I see this company steadily growing.  

$ELY also has a dividend that is poised to grow, it‚Äôs extremely small right now but that will most likely grow long term. The only red flag I see with this company is it‚Äôs 1.24 billion $ worth of debt.

Since it seems whatever market forces (lmao) are moving the price right now wants it to stay between $60-$70 I don't think it will go down below that unless a mass selloff happens for some reason. If it does I think I should have at least 25% left over to invest to bring the average down closer to maybe $40 if it goes really south.

TL;DR: Low risk, high reward.

On Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow the same exact pattern. While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive, and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

Yahoo Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term. People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is neither stock dead in the water yet? Why do both stocks show more resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily. Everyone is waiting until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can make ""easy money"".

Consensus: Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum that GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME because they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike wasn't relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point, AMC's shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype). If the momentum dies, then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this stock are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price for months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of having to pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the people shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

My hopes for GME,24,leffp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leffp6/my_hopes_for_gme/,76,1612701373.0,"Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.

I think three things need to happen for $GME to go up üöÄüåë.

First, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a üåàüêª that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.

Second, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares ü§öüíé‚úã and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!

Third, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being üåàüêª about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.

TlDr: This fight can be about big money fighting many retards' small money. But big money's position will weaken when they see there are actually good reasons to be long on GME.",2021-02-07 14:36:13

That aside, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN BROTHER

Ok, so, $WWE. World Wrestling Entertainment. The shit that nobody has watched since Stone Cold was beating the fuck out of Vince and Kurt Angle was drenching Vince's daughter with white, creamy milk.

The company is not doing great right now. COVID and wrestling do not mix at all. In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody can go see the shows. So this is a rebound play, obviously.

So here's the good. Starting with Wrestlemania in March, WWE will begin having limited amounts of fans in attendance. By year end, I'd think there is a decent chance at full attendance events. Maybe, I don't know. 

Having full houses soon is the obvious recovery angle, but even if houses aren't full, here's something to consider: WWE on the year as a whole increased operating income to 208 million. Thats a nearly 80% increase from 2019. The bulk of that comes from a rise in content fees. The point here is that even with limited ticket sales, WWE is smart about bringing in money.

One of the less obvious angles is the new deal with Peacock. The WWE network is a big source of revenue for WWE, but its now being completely migrated to Peacock Premium/Peacock ad free. WWE network has cost 9.99 per month forever and generally has a subscriber base of around 2 million. I don't know the details of what NBC Universal is paying for the WWE Network content (which includes every new PPV, every old PPV from WWE, ECW and WCW, and a huge catalog of original content), but what I do know is that as young as it is, Peacock already has more than 20 million subscribers. A lot of that may be free subscribers who won't get the WWE Network content, but assuming a quarter of them are paid subscribers and that 40% of WWE Network subscribers move to Peacock (very conservative), the WWE Network potential audience will reach 6 million people. And this is just a gut feeling, but if you're already paying for Peacock, why not tune in and catch a little bit of Wrestlemania? One of the undersold parts of this entire deal, I think anyway, is the potential for increased ad revenue. Now, Peacock offers an ad free subscription but WWE don't give a fuck. They have ""commercials"" during PPV events and advertise shit all through the show. Those advertisements could reach a lot more people now.

Now, here's the big one that a lot of people don't know about if you don't follow wrestling: the Saudi Deal. WWE is has an agreement to do two shows per year in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis pay 50 million per show. The Saudi shows obviously didn't happen this year, and WWE was not paid for them, it simply extended the contract until shows can resume. The agreement is for ten years.

Now, a hundred million dollars doesn't seem like a ton in the context of a publicly traded company, but considering that WWE raised its operating income, and I'm repeating myself, by nearly 80 percent to 208 million WITHOUT the expected 100 million from Saudi Arabia speaks pretty loudly.

Now, despite the pandemic troubles, $WWE has been trading mostly flat since COVID. It's at 49.23 now, down about 6-7 percent from Thursday close. It hit a low directly after COVID restrictions started at 34.13, but rebounded 44 dollars within about a month. If I didn't mention it before, WWE revenue actually went up this year. A measly 1%, but given the obstacles it's faced I'd say thats actually impressive. 

The timing of trying to play this one I really couldn't tell you. I think there's good room for growth in shares, but I wouldn't try playing weeklies on it. LEAPs I think could probably print you some money.

I'm gonna go ahead and just sort of close this out now cause I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing. I much prefer stealing DD from the people here smarter than I am but fuck it. 

Fuck ape gang nobody is gonna see this shit anyway.

DD: Synopsys to the moon,30,lef2w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lef2w3/dd_synopsys_to_the_moon/,15,1612700046.0,"Hello friends, it is your local cybersecurity investment friend. Today I wanted to provide a quick analysis on a company in the Cybersecurity sector that people haven't really noticed yet $SNPS (Synopsys).

Synopsys derives revenue from two main avenues, semiconductor and integrated circuit designs as well as software security. They also do consulting for both. Electronic Design Automation is 60% Revenue, Consulting is 30% Revenue, Security is 10% Revenue. With that cleared up, I'll reveal that my area of expertise is the software security arm of their business, but I'll write on both areas. I don't want to write about the consulting arm, because bodyshop businesses don't scale well so I think that part is supplemental NOT their core business despite 30% revenue.

# Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and Electronic Design Automation

Synopsys main focus is on developing software for companies to build Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and integrated circuit designs. They help customers design and test chips. They also have pre-designed circuits for licensing as components of larger chips. In addition, they also provide hardware and software verification/validation services for electronic systems.

I'm not a hardware guru, but as far as I am aware this area is highly competitive. Cadence and Siemens are breathing down Synopsys' neck for getting revenue from circuit design software and I don't see a TRUE competitve advantage. BUT it is not my area of expertise, so I defer that to hardware folk.

That being said, as we move towards Decentralised Finance I expect a significant increase in interest in running purpose-built hardware as a means to achieve new business needs. Digital Currency, machine learning, cloud computing, video processing, or even future automotive/vehicle circuits require custom-built, reliable, secure, and performant hardware. Synopsys is able to deliver on all these.

Supply chain risks are now elevated across all industries due to coronavirus and increasingly troubled international relationships. I expect a large focus on managing this risk from nation states by increasing domestic chip fabrication and design where cost-effective to do so. This is to avoid getting locked out of emerging technology by being unable to access chips, should China improve military and commercial routes in the South-China Sea / threaten Taiwans autonomy.

In addition, TSM, AMD, Micron, and Nvidia have seen dramatic share-price uplifts over the last year and I expect a rising tide to lift all ships. Synopsys is quite undervalued in this space and as a Domestic US design shop, I expect to see more interest in their technology offerings.

# Software Integrity

Cyber is a growing industry with a huge total addressable market. Here, I have seen investments in well-known or larger players like Fireeye, Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Cloudflare go well for friends here. Happy to go into more detail about each of these offerings at a later date, but for now let's go with Synopsys as a relatively low-traded stock.

Synopsys' Software Integrity business looks for vulnerabilities in software applications and helps developers fix them, hopefully early and cheaply before they get released into a production environment.

Within the Application Security / DevSecOps space, security tools tend to fall into sveral categories. I can't write their acronyms without Automoderator hating me though. Synopsys does a few of those.

1. Static Analysis - Look at code, find bugs, report. Static Analysis tools function in different ways. Some build normalised syntax tree's (computer science nerd shit, basically think of it as a translation of a book written in 34 languages to 1 language). Others simply grep for known bad words (ctrl+F print each line with that word). There are many open-source versions like semgrep and bandit available as well.
2. Software Composition Analysis - Look at the libraries used in your software for known security issues and provide guidance for fixing those. Generally, composition analysis isn't difficult from a technical perspective, and numerous open source tools exist like OWASP Dependency Checker, nodepackagemanager audit, and so on.
3. Dynamic Analysis - Run your software, then throw shit at it and see what breaks. Useful for quickly identifying areas that crash your app, or ones that cause weird behaviour, but not as effective as a penetration test because they can't cover business logic well. Owasp zed attack proxy is a good example, as well as Community Burp Suite.

# Why not use Open Source?

Enterprises often cannot use open-source security tools due to regulatory concerns around the security OR quality of the tools. Other aspects include lack of support contracts, having to manage it internally, lack of integrations with other enterprise systems, etc. While I have no issue with open source security tools, boards and executives clearly do due to the lack of risk transferral and the advantage of shifting accountability to vendors (See SolarWinds).

# Synopsys Value Prop

Security Vendors focus on having a broad enterprise security offering (Gitlab) or on building high quality but niche security tools (Thinkst Canary, Splunk, Snyk). Synopsys is the former, but over last few years have acquired two of the latter and then integrated them into their enterprise offering.

In the Static Analysis space, there are a few large enterprise juggernauts like Checkmarx, Veracode, Microfocus Fortify, and Appscan as well some smaller players. The general industry feeling is that each of these is cost too much, don't work in new environments, and are generally security compliance tools trying to fit into a devops world.

Synopsys Coverity in comparison was built with more focus on the developer experience. Developer satisfaction and cost generally trump security coverage in the app-sec space, so these ancient security product companies are failing. To illustrate, $MFGA which owns Fortify (a fantastic product from 12 years ago) currently has a 20% dividend at the moment. Not sure how they'll grow their share price or get further investment with a 20% div.

Unfortunately for Synopsys, with most enterprise security products, a stupid long contract has been signed w/ prior static analysis vendors mostly to keep Microfocus in business I guess. There are plenty of legacy static analysis deployments currently rotting in big enterprises so the total addressable market for Coverity is massive. This is assuming they are able to meet enterprise chief information security officers on the golf course.

# Technical Competitive Advantages:

* Broad programming language support
* Lack of mandatory compilation / builds reduces analysis time
* Incremental analysis means you don't need to compile the whole application every time you want to run a scan. 
* Direct integration into integrated development environments helps developers find issues before committing code.
* Lower false positive ratio, less noise is better for developer experience

Sometimes, people think adding features, more vulns types, extra integrations, etc makes for a more convincing product. I think that coverity, by simply being simpler with a  focus on the developer experience will win a lot of product bake-offs compared to competitors.

Another thing to note, these are long term recurring revenue licensing agreements. You won't get immediate bang for buck from these contracts, they are generally paid Month to Month and because of that, Synopsys has to wait for their coffers to fill over time.

# Blackduck composition analysis

Blackduck basically works the same as other composition analysis vendors, although there is a lot more competition now with WhiteSource and Snyk becoming increasingly active in their Developer user experience space. They were best in breed, but I can't confidently say that's true any more.

Composition Analysis is huge in the security world, validating the integrity and automatically reporting (and potentially fixing) supply-chain risks has a huge TAM. Software Engineers pull libraries from anywhere into their software application instead of writing the code themselves, inheriting the risk profile of that library AND the risk of it being maliciously modified. Blackduck addresses this by identifying software with weaknesses quickly, providing guidance, and by providing vulnerability research into potential malicious updates to packages. 

I'm super bullish on all Composition Analysis products as I don't see Software Engineering moving in any direction except for additional code re-use over re-inventing the wheel.

BONUS: Another vendor in this space I'd consider to be promising would be JFrog for the same reasons as Synopsys Blackduck with the JFrog Artifactory Xray offering providing a similar service.

# Summary

\- Synopsys does two things, Chips and Software Security.

\- Synopsys according to their Jan21 Q4 report has been getting increasing revenue across both their Chip and Integriy business divisions despite supply chain disruptions and the covid pandemic.

\- Chips and manufacturing are a huge booming business, a rising tide lifts all ships.

\- Cybersecurity has a large total addressable market. Synopsys focusses on software security and made two large acquisitions over last 3 years. Both are high quality products with a focus on user experience and are now fully integrated into the holistic Synopsys enterprise offering.

\- Synopsys has been doing share buybacks over the last few years, which at least indicates to me confidence in their cashflow and longterm prospects.

\- Assets have improved Q32019 $6.4m to Q12020 $7.3m while liabilities Q32019 $2.3m to Q12020 $3.0m. Revenue slight improvement, Q12019 830k > Q12020 860k DESPITE global pandemic disrupting entire world.

Bearish Factors:

\- High customer acquisition cost, Synopsys mainly targets whale enterprises, so banking/governemnt/military/etc.

\- Acquihired talent lockup ends 2022 for Coverity and 2023 for Blackduck, will see if they stick around.

\- One of their Principal Sales Engineers told me I was a good kid and bought me a coke instead of whiskey at a networking event. Boomers in sales positions :(

**TL:DR Positions:** Synopsys does  chips and software security. Chip companies are mooning. Cyber is mooning. Why not both?

Been a hell of a start to 2021. Thanks WSB,57,lef1wr,https://i.redd.it/ae3u3n2sdzf61.jpg,7,1612699950.0,,2021-02-07 14:12:30
The Anatomy of a Coming Disaster.,6137,lef1aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lef1aq/the_anatomy_of_a_coming_disaster/,751,1612699889.0,"Hi.

Some of you know me, some of you don't.  If you DO, I ask that you not shill for me in the comments below, so we can stay within the rules of this sub.

This post is for the newbies, it is written as such, if you already know what delta hedging is, this post isn't for you.  If you *don't*, well, lads and lasses, this is for you.

We need to understand a few basic things here, and in keeping with the spirit of this post, we're going to keep it dead simple.

Market Makers (the big dogs behind the scenes, facilitating your yolos) DO NOT CARE if your options plays pay out for you.  They would be crazy to take on the level of risk that selling you an unhedged call or put would represent.  These guys make money in other ways.  So how can they not care?  Simple, they hedge.  Generally speaking, they buy enough shares when you buy a call so that even if you win hugely, they simply sell the shares they bought when you bought the call, and remain risk neutral.  (Edit, I've been asked to explain that market makers make money by recouping the difference between the bid/ask spread.  While this seems small, they do a LOT of it.)

Why does this matter?

Well, it matters because it introduces *leverage*.  Which simply means it amplifies the effect your money has on the stock market.  

As an example of how this works lets makes up a company.  We'll call the ticker ABC.  And we'll say the share price is 10 bucks.   You, as a degenerate yolo artiste, only have 100 bucks to play with, and you think ABC is going to the mewn.  

Now, you could do the boomer thing and just buy 10 shares of ABC (we'll call this scenario A), but a lifetime of minimum wage and renting a closet for 5k a month has done strange things to your risk management, so you decide to buy calls instead.  You go to whatever broker isn't fucking robinhood and take a look at your options - and there you see it.  For that SAME 100 bucks you can buy ten calls and leverage a hell of a lot more shares.   (We'll call this scenario B) So you do it, you buy the calls.

How does your choice effect the underlying stock?

In scenario A, you bought ten shares, you increased demand for the stock by 10 shares, and this does almost but not exactly nothing to the price.

In scenario B, you bought 10 calls, you made Mr. MM buy a lot of shares to hedge your bet, and you increased the demand for the stock by a much larger number of shares.  (This is an over simplification, but that's what we do here) Which does *something* to the share price.  Even if it's pretty small.
(Edit, as I said, this was an over simplification but I've been asked to address it.  Market makers use a number of metrics to determine how many shares they need to hedge your bet.  It is a lot, but it is almost never 100 times your call options)

Now, if you're part of the ""We like ABC stock"" gang, and 20 thousand of you buy 10 calls... Well, I forgot my calculator, but suffice to say you've just invited market makers to buy a FUCK TON of shares.  Just this, without any actual change in earnings, outlook, of fundamentals on ABC, puts tremendous bullish pressure on the stock *for the term of the option*

And THAT my friends, is the market we find ourselves in.  Talking heads on the news continue to talk about how ""CraZy thE p/E raTiOs haVe bEcomE!!!""  Without mentioning what is actually driving this phenomenon.

Its options.  Specifically since March.  

So with that I'll tell you something pretty goddamn spectacular.  The stock market has become a *derivative* of the options market.  Earnings don't matter, fundamentals don't matter, past performance doesn't matter. The OPTIONS matter. 

This has happened before, in a very different way.  You know how there was a lot of noise in 08 about all the housing derivatives?  We're there again, except for instead of CDOs it's happening with with the shares of the biggest companies in the world.

Want proof?  Go look at 10 day spy chart, right now.  Then go look at a GME chart.  Look what happens to spy, tick for tick, as GME rises and falls. When the entire options meme market is focused on one ticker.

So what do we do about it?  Nobody knows.  I do know this, GME was only the *beginning*.  Retail knows it has the bull by the tail now.  What happens when the stock market becomes a lagging indicator of the sentiment of retail bull chads?

I don't know, but it's going to be *spectacular*.

Edit, much of the thinking around this post comes from months of conversation with a friend of mine.  She's pointed out since I posted this that she has written this up in a way 10 of us will understand in her latest blog post - which can be found here: https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/options-degenerate-marketplaces-part-1-b0ddf1c96fa6",2021-02-07 14:11:29

Covering and closing a short position are the same thing. Sorry for my mistake.

~~**Covering** short positions does not equal **closing** short positions. Everyone doing math trying to prove that GME short positions couldn't have been ""covered"" seems to ignore, overlook, or not realize the difference. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts and long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months, eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.

Losing money always sucks. As much as we joke about it, I know how terrible it feels. Bought GME and AMC near their highs like a true autist. Current loss (unrealized) is relatively tame for me, which speaks to just how much I've fucked up this past year. So I thought I'd make something **wholesome** for all my diamond hands out there. **Full 3 min video meme** of Sam's Speech from LOTR is here (WSB doesn't let me embed the full video in the post): [https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if\_frodos\_still\_in\_im\_still\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbullenergy/comments/lbexr6/if_frodos_still_in_im_still_in/)

Honestly, the original speech does more justice than my captions. If Sam's words don't give you both life and make you weep as if you bought $800 OTM GME weeklies on Monday, then I'm not sure what will. Let me ask you, did Frodo let Sauron (Melvin in our case) get the one ring (our GME shares)? Ok, maybe he came close, but that's why he had his **gay diamond balled boyfriend Sam** with him to help him stay strong. Don't forget, you've got thousands (perhaps many more) of fellow Sams **holding the line** with you üíéüôåüíé. **Don't give in now.**

We've gone through hell and back again, but the journeys not over yet. **We still gotta carry GME all the way to fucking Mordor.** Only then will we see the **mother** of all short squeezes, and all that's green and good in this world will be ours once again.

I know all you apes are experiencing market withdrawal this weekend, but hope you're relaxing. Watch some Lord of the Rings. It'll make you feel better.

Positions: 12 shares GME @ $346.94, 468 shares AMC @ $12.43. Not much compared to some, but it's all I could afford. Please come back for me. Yes I know I bought near the peak. Did I mention I'm kinda retarded?",2021-02-07 13:40:15

Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as* ***I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA!*** *I have, hopefully, labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations, and pointed out some general assumptions,more shorts mean more gains, sarcastically, that do not always appear to be true in the given data.*

# These are just general findings, so chill the fuck out!

&#x200B;

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA, Jan29th text file ( [http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt)) Feb 5th text file ([http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-""The screaming cries of wallstreetbets""

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual ""Retail Investors"" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

&#x200B;

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?----->NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The ""big bois"" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, ""Retail Investors"" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

So Clover Health, they use machine learning to personalize the Medicare experience for each specific patient to lower healthcare costs through improved decision making. Their growth is tied to virtuous cycles (positive feedback loops) by using improving machine learning to continuously lower costs over time. Currently CLOV annual growth rate is 38%. Hindenburg recently released a negative report on the company that brought down the stock price 15% in the past few days, but it‚Äôs started to turn around Friday. It‚Äôs down from it‚Äôs all time high of $17.45. Could be a good buying opportunity.

Anyone who knows more about the company have any further insight? I got in on the dip on Friday. 

Positions: 100 shares @ 11.78 ; 10 12/17 $12.5 calls

TLDR: talk about things other than GME. CLOV seems like it‚Äôs in a position for positive growth and could be a good play to buy the dip on.

* Company represents an excellent deep value prospect for long-term investors.
* The company has an excellent operating history but was slammed by the current downturn.
* Leverage is not unreasonable and once the company turns around, it will offer strong upside prospects.
* New fad of collecting Pops!
* Shares rallied \~25% in the aftermath of reporting third-quarter results.
* This is due to a broad earnings beat in Q3 alongside a general recovery in the markets for names tethered to economic recovery.
* It's impact from the pandemic bottomed out in Q2, and though revenue is expected to be negative through Q4, Wall Street expects a return to growth next year.
* Company trades at only \~15x next year's EPS estimates and \~8x the earnings it generated in FY19.

This company is an iconic modern-day toy company. Despite its status as a fast-growing, quality firm at the height (so far) of its popularity, the company has been slammed by fears related to retail shutdowns. Investors have panicked about deserted malls and sent shares of the firm spiraling down in recent months. Near-term pain is over and the company‚Äôs prospects improving, now might be a good time to jump in and consider buying up a piece of the enterprise on the cheap.

**A great operating history**

Operating history of this company has been, over time, really impressive. Take, for instance, the case of revenue. Between 2017 and 2019, sales at the firm grew 54.1% from $516.08 million to $795.12 million. As sales at the company grew, the company‚Äôs profits improved as well. Back in 2017, the company‚Äôs net income totaled just $3.94 million. By 2019, net profit had grown to $11.73 million. Before we move on to other metrics, the firm‚Äôs net profit does warrant some discussion. Despite the company‚Äôs strong brand name, it has been unable to capitalize on it in the way that can generate attractive margin. Even in 2019, its best year on record, the company‚Äôs net profit margin was 1.5%. It‚Äôs a positive that this trend has been improving, but until margins grow substantially from here, the company is at risk of a bad year really hurting it.

While bottom line wasn't great during shut downs, its other operating metrics are attractive. Operating cash flow, for instance, totaled $90.77 million. This was more than triple the $23.84 million in operating cash flow seen two years earlier. Even compared to 2018, this metric is up 81.6%. This works out to an operating cash flow margin for 2019 of 11.4%. Another important metric, Adjusted EBITDA, has also done well. Back in 2017, this metric totaled $90.03 million. This grew 36.7% to $123.04 million by 2019. This margin works out to 15.5% for 2019.

**It might be time to jump on board**

There‚Äôs no doubt that it is being hit at the moment, but it‚Äôs important to keep the eye on the long-term outlook. Though management has provided no long-term guidance for the business, its operating history prior to the pandemic suggests that its future will continue to be bright once the crisis is past.

If we use metrics from 2019, its price/earnings ratio of 17 looks quite high. Its price/operating cash flow multiple, though, is far lower at 2.20. Its EV/EBITDA multiple on that basis is also low at 2.94. This makes the company a clear deep-value prospect. Even if we annualize the firm‚Äôs first quarter EBITDA, its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is still quite reasonable at 7.60, which means that **it is cheap** now if we assumed that the future of the business would look a lot more like this year is likely to look.

**Takeaway**

Based on the data provided, it‚Äôs clear to me that this company presents investors with some very attractive prospects at the moment. The company has a nice operating history. Its cash flows are particularly attractive. Right now, the business is being hurt by the global pandemic just like most firms across most industries, but once this pain passes, the upside from here could be quite significant. **It is a great reopening investment and also great play on collectable fad that staying at home has ushered.**

Food for Thought,52,lecqve,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lecqve/food_for_thought/,46,1612692203.0," 

I wanted to take a time-out and lay out some of my thoughts on everything that has happened in the last few weeks. This was always about seeing the VALUE in the future of the company, and making a play on that value. Yes it was shorted an extreme amount and we saw the potential in the short squeeze as well. There were many excellent DD's written about both the company and the potential for the short squeeze along with possible scenario's for this. I personally didn't think we would see any drastic change in price until after Q4 ER, but look at where we are now.

With that being said, I want to focus on several things that have happened over the course of January, how it impacted us, and why this is still continuing today. I will start with January 12th, as this is when things started to get interesting.

Jan 12th:

GME closes around $20.

Jan 13th:

GME opens around $28

GME closes around $31

Jan 14th:

GME opens around $35

GME closes around $40

From January 14th to close of January 21st, GME trades sideways between $35-$45. Later that evening on January 21st, something crazy happened....

WSB was taken down, and a picture was put up that said DoJ, FBI, ICE, and Europool had seized this ""hidden site"". Like what? Its a public forum.... ok, anyways. WSB is down for an hour or two, and when it comes back up, there's a VERY interesting post from a guy that says there are much bigger players involved in this, a shitstorm is brewing, and he has proof that the mods have verified. The top comment is from a mod that said he had verified OP's sources. I barely got to read through the post once along with the mods comment before Reddit kicked me out and the app reset on my phone. Boom, post is gone, and a few people mention seeing it and wondering wtf that was all about. Now we get to January 22nd, a Friday.

January 22nd:

GME opens at $47

GME closes around $64

Most if not call options are ITM. Gamma squeeze time. Hype had started to creep in during the weekend. We open Monday like this:

January 25th:

GME opens around $117

GME closes around $76

At some point during this week, I don't remember exactly which day, the media started attacking us. Bots started to fill up our beloved subreddit, and our lines of communication were hurt while we sorted through the bullshit.

January 26th:

GME opens around $87

GME closes around $150

January 27th:

GME opens around $370

GME closes around $350

January 28th:

GME hits above $500 in premarket.

Before markets officially open, RH and other brokers decide to block all buying, and allow only selling. Fidelity and a few others did not participate in this, the majority did.

GME closes around $200

January 29th:

GME opens around $330

GME closes above $320

When GME closed above $320, most calls were ITM (cant remember if we had $800c options yet). Lots of media saying the squeeze already happened, bot attacks, media saying we are pumping SLV (wut? lol) or random biotech companies, and negative posts from bots / whoever the fuck else.

February 1st:

GME opens around $240

GME closes around $220

I don't think I need to recap the next couple of days for you, it is burned into our minds, but several important things happened. DFV was called to testify on the 19th of February in front of the House Financial Services Committee. On Wednesday our sub was compromised and tons of negative sentiment flooded in, a lot of new members posting the diamond hand spam, etc. Our sub is most likely still compromised, and we don't know when we will have it back.

So lets highlight what they have done so far:

1. Discredit DFV in the media, and call him to testify.

2. Break our lines of communication by compromising our subreddit.

3. Sow doubt and fear amongst us with the flood of bots and negative sentiment. We have suspect accounts posting gain porn from GME, downvoting or telling people to sell, and spamming the sub with other bullshit.

4. Restricting demand of stock while it is flooded with supply. This wasn't lifted until Friday, in which we saw our first green day of the week. (**FUCK ROBINHOOD IN PARTICULAR!** We don't care if you want to blame it on the DTCC, you caved in, plus, where did that 3bn in additional capital come from you managed to raise by Thursday?)

5. Paper Portnoy getting his million followers to jump in and subsequently sell for a loss. I truly wouldn't be surprised if this was a ploy by the men up top to pump and dump the stock and scare everyone into selling.

6. 4 days of red before restrictions are removed and demand catches back up to supply (price dropping increases demand also via opportunity cost). Keep in mind, a lot of people were transferring holdings over to new brokers and had money tied up until Friday, when we see our first green day.

Let me be crystal clear here, if they have to tell us we have lost, yet still attack us, then we haven't lost. There is a LOT more going on here than just retail vs hedge funds. This is not over, and the big players know it. Most of us here from the beginning are here to see it to the end, as it was always about the future value of the company. To our brothers who bought at the top and are still holding, we are coming. It may not be next week, it may not even be in the next few months (I'm still eyeing Q4 ER), but we are coming. I don't care if you think the stock is overvalued at $66.50. I don't give a fuck if you sold for a loss. You don't realize any gains or losses until you sell. Buy the dip and average down retard. I will be holding because I can afford to hold, and I believe in the future of this company. I am not a financial professional, just a smooth brained retard. I do hold positions in GME and have been in since $14.

This is not financial advice, just sharing my thoughts.

Now some people say there is something fishy going on and the mods are still compromised.

However I would want to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe GME is still so huge that no one wants to make good DDs or alternatively there actually aren't any good DDs except for people trying to push penny stocks. In any case there have only been 3-4 DD posts over the past 48h.

For over 4mil active members, that's hardly anything.

If people have experienced DD posts been taken down for no rule violation, then please repost the text here as a quote in the comments.

@Mods: this is supposed to generate transparency if it gets traction. If good DDs are thrown out due to a spam of Pennystocks or stronger enforcement of rules, then we can easily assess this here and it gives the community a transparent view on the DD situation.

Thanks for the work you do.

AMC Stock: A Retard's Short DD,479,lebq9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lebq9c/amc_stock_a_retards_short_dd/,100,1612688965.0," TL;DR: Low(er) risk, high reward.

On   Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow  the same exact pattern.  While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.

Reason: More shorts.

Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:

[https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce](https://preview.redd.it/yruf6hf0wxf61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3759124e6d89b985491b41cb52b044f61b334dce)

Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?

On Friday, GME opened at 54.04, and AMC opened at 7.17.

GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around 6.9.

3% of 7.17 is .2151. In other words, 7.17 - .2151 is 6.95.

10% of 54.04 is 5.404. In other words, 54.04 + 5.404 = 59.444.

So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?

13%.

The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?

13%.

For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.

GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \*started\* it's rise in the aftermarket.

[the dark blue for AMC is broken in the spike on the right, it was identical to GME.](https://preview.redd.it/xeng554cyxf61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5f913a840d0f1009db5362fa8712572b2d1429)

GME   is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling   down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive,   and there's more volume to play around with.

However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,

[https://preview.redd.it/lpd7nbttyxf61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65d6bc072f237dba0a82c7c03052952b78e200d](https://preview.redd.it/lpd7nbttyxf61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65d6bc072f237dba0a82c7c03052952b78e200d)

Yahoo   Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as ""Neutral"" despite the amount   of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the   performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term.    People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is   neither stock dead in the water yet?  Why do both stocks show more   resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?

People   shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money   on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily.  Everyone is waiting   until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate   those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily   shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business   before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can   make ""easy money"".

Consensus:   Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and   definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday   than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum  that  GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME  because  they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike  wasn't  relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point,  AMC's  shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype).  If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.

Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?

Firstly, Disney is a strong competitor to Netflix with their streaming service, Disney+. Since its release they have pumped subscription numbers that only Netflix could dream about. Disney is not only trying to increase their revenues through blockbuster movies, but also by dragging new viewers to flagship series such as 'The Mandalorian' and more recently, 'WandaVision'. On top of this they are planning to produce more Marvel series (they own Marvel Studios daah...). These series will most likely be starring big boi action figures such as Electro, Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, Doctor Strange and Thor. I don't know shit about these characters since I could care less about The Avengers (all I care about is stonks).

Secondly, Disney will rocket to Pluto when the Pandemic is over and they open up their amusement parks. All kids and/or your wives kids (from another boyfriend/husband) will beg their parents to ride Mickey Mouse's Roller Coaster and Disney is going to pump the revenues like they never have before. Do you remember when when you were a kid and always begged your parents for stuff? Well that is going to happen with both Disney+ and their amusement parks. Kids will cry till their parents take them there.

Thirdly, invest on your own risk. This is only food for thought! I will give you some more spicy investment advise should I be successful. No Profit & Loss, Balance sheet and Cash Flow stuff here, just pure future prospects, a.k.a. YOLO.

Is Melvin still shorting GME?,38,leberf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leberf/is_melvin_still_shorting_gme/,98,1612688009.0,"Hey guys just want you all to check my smooth brain math and tell me what you think.

My understanding is that Melvin Capital held a short position of approximately 40% of GME shares, or approximately 38M shares.

E: 38M is a worse than worst case number 40% would be approx 28M. Also I don't even know where 40% comes from I've just seen it around reddit a bunch. It's probably much higher than reality.

Melvin reported losses of approximately $6B in January well before the share hit $300 and claimed to be out of their position on the ~~22nd~~ 26th when the shares were worth approximately ~~$50~~ $150. But for the worse than worst possible case scenario let's use $300 share price and see if the numbers add up.

https://www.tradingdirect.com/pricing/Interest-Rates#:~:text=The%20formula%20for%20the%20interest,Corp%20at%20%2425%20per%20share.

>The formula for the interest calculation will be: (Market Value x Rate x # of days) / 360.

I have seen the rates for GME reported at an insanely high 10%, let's assume worse than worst case scenario and and call that 15%.

Let's also not worry about complicated integrals and assume the price was $300 every day of january.

So, ($300 * .15 * 30) / 360 * 38,000,000 = $142,500,000

Last time I checked $142.5M is a whole lot less than 6B using every possible worse than worst case scenario. Seems like their losses were probably incurred exiting their short position.

How reports in the media claiming that Reddit WallStreetBets was pushing a Silver Squeeze started. Timeline with links. (BTW: It was Reuters on January 28th at 12:03pm),2128,lemo97,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/,190,1612734170.0,"#In response to u/RizzutosNOTAWORD [post on trying to catalogue every news story about the Reddit Short-squeeze on Silver](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/), I though I would give it a try. Turns out there are over 1000 articles on it. But in doing that research I found a fairly accurate history of how this all started. And, just to be clear, a post on WSB did set the price of Silver skyrocketing; but, also to be clear, some reporters are just lazy.

#**Background**

- Monday, January 25, 2021, $GME stock reached a high price of $159 per share before dropping to $76. Even though the CNBC people were calling this ‚ÄúA Side Show,‚Äù they spent most of the day talking about it.

-Tuesday, January 26th, 2021, $GME closes at $147 per share. WSB goes Viral on news that Melvin Capital needed a 2.5 Billion dollar bail out. [WSB clocks 15 million unique searches that day alone.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pnax/wsb_traffic_growth_what_going_viral_looks_like/)

-Wednesday, January 27th, 2021, WSB was national and international front-page news. $GME hits $350 per share. [Here‚Äôs the Today Show segment about us, showing front page headlines, and Stephanie Rule showing us some love‚Ä¶ despite being worried for ‚Äònew investors‚Äô (but we‚Äôll definitely take the love part)](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922)

#January 27th, 2021:
#How the Reddit / $SLV Rumor began
##(I‚Äôm just assuming WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day)\

1. On Thursday, January 27, 2021, u/jjalaj30 (who is not a bot) posted:
[‚ÄúTHE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD SLV SILVER $25-$1000‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/gl1u57n/?context=3)  Good for Him being passionate about his investments, BTW! This post must have been seen by millions because, I‚Äôm just assuming, WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day given the virality of the previous days.

Sales of Silver ETFs and Spot began to rise 

$GME reaches $480 (OP buys 1.45 shares of $GME at $360 because Why Not. Also bought $BBBY at $36‚Ä¶ and holding).  Robinhood shuts down trading, $GME price starts immediately crashing 

2.On Thursday afternoon, at 12:03pm (I‚Äôm assuming eastern time?) the First article about Reddit causing the price Silver to go up is written by Reuters.  [‚ÄúReddit raiders swarm silver stocks as GameStop, BlackBerry retreat‚Äù](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29X2DT) and quotes directly from u/jjalaj30‚Äôs post

3. On Thursday afternoon, 2:45pm, metal industry websites and investor blogs begin running blog articles stating ‚ÄùReddit Day Traders‚Äù are fueling this random rise in Silver sales:

-[Street](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/silver-prices-surge-as-reddits-retail-army-refocuses-wrath-against-precious-metal-short-sellers-202101281501)

4. The first article claiming WSB was leaving $GME and heading to silver came from the Wall Street Journal at 4:38pm: [Silver Surges as Game Stop Traders Move Into Other Assets.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/silver-surges-as-gamestop-day-traders-move-into-other-assets-11611848703?mod=searchresults_pos8&amp;page=1) 


5. Blogger/reporter Anna Golubova posted an article at 11:48pm on Kitco about an Army of Day Traders piling into silver? She explains that analysts think the price of silver will reach $40 and [shares a screenshot of the above post by u/jjalaj30.](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-28/Army-of-day-traders-piling-into-silver-As-prices-rally-analysts-point-to-40-and-higher.html)

##Friday, January 29, 2021

7.Friday, 2am, Bloomberg runs a story: [Reddit Investors piling into silver raise prices a Second Day.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/silver-market-jitters-are-on-display-after-reddit-frenzy)

8.Friday Morning, Kitco News does a long segement discussing the Wednesday Reddit post about shorting Silver: https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Market-Analysis/3191/2021-01-29/Retail-investors-want-to-short-squeeze-silver-to-$1k-is-this-possible#_48_INSTANCE_puYLh9Vd66QY_=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitco.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Flatest%3Fshow%3DMarket-Analysis


9. But a metal indusrty blog Mining [dot] Com does an entry on Friday morning cslling this a ***‚ÄúFrenzy.‚Äù***: [Silver Prices rally for second day on Reddit Frenzy](https://www.mining.com/silver-prices-higher-on-reddit-frenzy/)\

Weekend sales of physical Silver soar. From Friday to Monday the price of Silver goes from $25.50 to $28.50. That‚Äôs a huge jump in the silver market. Somehow, the only explanation for this has to be Reddit, right.\

10. Sunday, January 31, 2021. Bllomberg TV does a story: [Reddit-Inspired Army takes aim at silver.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-01/reddit-inspired-army-takes-aim-at-silver-video)


##By Monday, Feburary 1, 2021. All the news outlets are running with a story that Reddit is causing the silver price to spike.

The Wall Street Journal runs story: [Reddit‚Äôs Silver Rush Is Another Symptom of Market Madness]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-silver-rush-is-another-symptom-of-market-madness-11612183688?mod=searchresults_pos6&amp;page=1)

If you go to Google News and type in ‚ÄúReddit Silver‚Äù for that date of Feburary 1st, 2021, you‚Äôll get 13 pages of results. This is my favorite one:

Monday, Feburary1, 2021, at 11:53am, Yahoo Finance publishes a story based on a person‚Äôs tweet (I‚Äôm not kidding, its based on a Tweet): [Is Silver the New Game Stop? Thanks to Reddit, Precious Metals hits 11 year high.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-gamestop-thanks-reddit-precious-163259125.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZDsEHA-5OI2NT7xu3gDSn-lm5-Z3hF-SmzHD37Ltfe7CsXTW2GlA34k2slxHlCvDD0sz94ubt2biqmTiijfuYhyEnN_GiRvx7SsCjgw0WMVtUaqP8xPAHS2f0-AfSx5O9Dx5rG13NR6nZCpwMx6X9vRl97RIalfeddG-tctorR)

##On Tuesday, 3/2/2021, The price of silver ‚Äòcorrects.‚Äô Stocks WSB are HOLDING THE LINE on ($GME, $AMC, $BB,) start losing some market value too. So naturally all the new outlets lump Sliver, $GME, $AMC, $BB as one WSB total corridnated Short-Squeeze attack that failed because all these Redditors were stupid. 

Tuesday, Forbes: [Reddit Group Fails in Effort to Squeeze Silver Market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2021/02/02/reddit-group-fails-in-effort-to-squeeze-the-silver-market/?sh=2e2dde403bcb)

##So, Yes, a Redditor did post on WSB about silver. Reuters ran a story about the post, then Metal Industry people wrote articles about the post after Reuters, then The Wall Street Journal said WSB moving away from $GME and into silver, then lazy journalism took over where other reporters just start copying other reporters‚Äô articles [ - Here is a Good Read on that - ](https://observer.com/2015/04/journalisms-sourcing-problem/), and then when silver corrected on the same day $GME and $AMC took a hit, all the media blamed us.",2021-02-07 23:42:50

The data seems convincing, i guess but i don't actually know enough to evaluate that shit, so you could probably convince me of anything using the same data.

So, to the people that aren't too emotional invested in this, not giving a fuck about hedgefounds, diamond hands etc:

Do you think GME will go up again? If so, do you actually think it's going to the moon or does it just go up to like 200 again?

Edit: I think there was a misunderstanding. Don't worry, i didn't buy anything. Just wanted to understand the whole thing better and maybe decide to buy a bit afterwards.

I'm not asking in the since to make a ton of money off it, but more on the level of helping the company. Does buying stock help the company in some way?


I also am wondering what happens if you have a ton of stock in a company. I remember in some older movies if you own the majority of the stock you have say in some of the actions a company makes. Is that actually how that works or is that just movie plot magic?",2021-02-07 23:04:48

Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze,0,lelwdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lelwdj/why_irbt_might_be_the_next_big_short_squeeze/,49,1612731149.0,"Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that‚Äôs us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin\_capital\_13f\_q3\_2020\_put\_flags/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5euzp/melvin_capital_13f_q3_2020_put_flags/)

Yeah, that‚Äôs right. Melvin is. Among others‚Ä¶  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let‚Äôs talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That‚Äôs 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I‚Äôm not recommending buying this stock. I‚Äôm also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast.

When families return to the quasi-popular pizza place who's mascot is a rat, Redditors hope to sell the tokens back to parents a 16,000% return rate, which the parents will be forced to pay so their crying 7 year old can play Ski Ball.",2021-02-07 22:14:29

GME shares are worth more than 2500 $ each,265,lelal9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lelal9/gme_shares_are_worth_more_than_2500_each/,204,1612728403.0,"I thought a lot about the current GME events, what happened until now, and what could happen in the near future. 

&#x200B;

Please consider that I'm just a retard and most likely just hate my wife's boyfriend. I'm no investment adviser and I just love this stock. 

&#x200B;

**What we saw until now:**

\- In a previous post we saw that two retards limit sell orders of 2500$ and 5000$ were successful. 

\- In most media, even the international ones, there is a big emphasis on that GME squeeze is lost. 

\- The media also strongly recommend to sell the shares, learn from our mistake, and move on... As if they have our best interest in mind. 

&#x200B;

**What didn't happen until now:**

\- The Squeeze

\- Only the retards are currently the ones actively going for the squeeze 

&#x200B;

**My hypothesis:** 

\-Why only the retards went for the squeeze until now?

\-Why other parties didn't went for the squeeze with us? 

\-Why are we encouraged to sell our shares?

\-Who is going to buy the shares we sell? Only HF? Or other POIs? 

&#x200B;

Imho the only correlation between most parties involved in GME events is greed. And as long as the squeeze doesn't happen, we should hold our shares, especially the ones with lost porn. Most likely they are going to be the ones who will profit the most, as it doesn't make sense for them to sell anyways. 

The game is still being played and most likely the ones who are going to profit from this are the most retarded/patient holders.  

Holding 140 GME shares. My estimate per share is 2500$ or above. 

With RC and the new management at GME 450$ per share by 2023 is anyways reasonable.

but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO),0,lek9bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lek9bx/but_what_if_we_try_to_invest_in_gopro_gpro/,53,1612723579.0,"Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around. But investors will have to wait another year to see if it's enough to result in a profitable year.",2021-02-07 20:46:19

IMPORTANT: Newcomers read,708,lejlom,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lejlom/important_newcomers_read/,148,1612720293.0,"Oh hey fellow retards, I see you hopped onto the stonk train and pulled up to the WSB station. Welcome to the retarded corner of reddit - grab your wife and her boyfriend, put on your special helmets, and take a seat in your timeout chairs. Today we're going to discuss the basics of WSB culture, and a few do's and don'ts. 


*What exactly is WSB?*


We are a sub focused on making million to one odds bets on different meme stonks, typically chosen because of a funny/memelike/autistic ticker or some creatively retarded DD posted by some idiot with no understanding of market fundamentals who likely just barely passed high school (most of us, including myself). As most of us go broke and balls deep into debt from weekly calls, a few of us get incredibly lucky and their gain porn convinces the rest of us to get a second mortgage on our homes. As the crippling debt piles on, we post our losses so that we can show off our huge karma gains to our wife's boyfriend so he thinks we're cool like him. The story *always* ends well.


*Is WSB a movement?*


No retard. WSB was never intended to be a massive movement, and no the goal of WSB wasn't/isn't to ""wage war against the rich"". The goal is to become rich, so to wage a war against what we ultimately aim to achieve is rather counterproductive. If you're here because you think we care about/share your political/economic views, you're on the wrong sub *brotatoe*. WSB is about getting filthy rich, or ruining your financial situation for a majority of your adult life while trying. We don't aim to ""stick it to the man"", we all aspire to *BE* the man. If you haven't noticed, even u/MartinShkreli is a mod here.

Emphasis: *We do not care about your political views.*              *F off.*


*Didn't WSB intentionally orchestrate the GME short squeeze and collapse of several financial institutions?*


Well yes, and no. Yes, the GME short squeeze was a very popular DD being pushed for months - but the reasoning wasn't exactly to wage a war against big financial institutions. The main reason GME was being pushed so hard on here was because people wanted to make so many tendies that they could buy out the Wendy's they work the drive through at. The chaos that ensued because of the shortsqueeze is only an added bonus - Melvin can suck it. 


*""I only came here to join the movement against Wallstreet...""*


*F off*



*Do's and don'ts:*


As I mentioned (so many times, here's some rockets in case you skipped everything else above üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ), this sub is NOT a political movement, posting your politics on here is not acceptable. No matter what political party is currently on top, there are different plays you can make to get those sweet tendies. 

Do not post or promote your pump and dump schemes. Working together is great, what happened with GME was badass - but remember that there's a VERY thin line between teamwork and market manipulation (one of which being highly illegal).

DO enjoy and join in on our culture, call each other retards and autists, talk about your wife being gangbanged by your successful neighbors and you unsuccessfully tryna impress one of her boyfriends. Share your gains/losses - nothing gets me harder than seeing someone lose 40k. Make some ridiculous DD about some obscure company no one has ever heard about, and convince 20 retards to join you because we're all idiots. 


LASTLY - *Don't be a loser.*
