As far as I know, mods do not make money here and are against to monetize this subreddit. But instead of random monkeys selling the merch, you could just sell it yourselves and stick a post about it. This is something that represents the community and, as members, I think, most would agree that  WSB products should be sold through WSB community. I dont really know if it could get you in trouble or it is against your rules, but I just wanted to give the idea.

TLDR: Yes Merch or No Merch? YES or NO? Checking the sentiment for mods as they might be shy to post about it.

I am not interested in getting involved or smth and
this is not a business advice. Please do your own research, dear mods.

1) Vlad is someone who knows he did something wrong, and knows **he will get caught but theres a small chance he can get away. It's a matter of when**. He has very little confidence he won't get caught but he's not giving up.  

2) He's scared when he will get exposed. Right now, he is only partially exposed. The real truth isn't fully out yet. **He isn't fully exposed yet for whatever he did wrong.**

3) This means when the **truth is fully out** people will know Vlad did something for the sake of his own self/company profiting/avoiding losses resulting in the loss of others(RH's users). Right now we are only picking stuff here and there and very close but no one has hard undeniable evidence yet. We are very close.

4) He isn't blaming others this means **They fucked up together or RH fucked up alone and solved it by fucking the users instead.** If they start blaming each other now, they will take all of them down together. So the best strategy is to not blame anyone and blame luck/market/situation...etc THis is why they don't dare blame each other.

5) Undeniable truth is all GME investors should have made money. even if you lost all ur money just realize this hard fact. **YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE MADE MONEY.** This is one of those rare times that you shouldn't blame yourselves. You didn't invest stupidly. It's never a good idea to avoid blame, but for this one weird occurrence, you shouldn't blame yourself.

Who to blame: 

1) Robinhood 1000% we know that

2) maybe clearing house but this one im not sure since i don't know much about the specific details. I just know a guilty person on live TV",2021-02-20 19:18:48

However, volume seemed rather low these past few weeks, and on Tuesday we opened at the weekly high and have trended lower since. This of course is not of technical significance at all, but ""tops"" never seem obvious until of course the real selling pressure begins to kick in. 

The 10 year treasury potentially bottomed last month, and has spiked since. You have a company like TSLA that has entered the SP on, meaning no disrespect to the company or its investors, but on very lofty valuations. SPY has literally rallied 70% since the March 2020 lows, with record breaking speed. How is the average American doing though? A new administration with huge spending plans now has both chambers of Congress. Deficit spending will go into the twilight zone. Rates at 0%. 

9-12% drawdown for SPY seems likely in March. Not calling a bear market, or an ""absolute top"" but I don't think equities will perform this year and I think the short side may be the trade. Could be we draw down to 348-355, then a rally through the summer that takes us to the important level of 370. This may act as a second top, and we fall again to make a lower low at 328, bottoming in October November 2021. From here it will be a strong long position to load up on.

First off with UNH let‚Äôs talk about the value. With an annual revenue of 257 billion dollars and PE ratio of only 20.39, it makes it a strong value based investment. They‚Äôve seen growth in numerous sectors, and although health insurance did see a rough 4th quarter due to COVID related costs, it was what they expected, and the future outlook is looking bright. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about politics, some people might think the Biden administration talking about returning to the ACA is a bad thing, but it isn‚Äôt. Healthcare companies did exceptionally well due to more involvement before trump, and the government gives them incredible tax breaks and subsidies. 

Lots of institutions are now buying the stock in it‚Äôs this range, we‚Äôre below all short term and long term averages, UNH is too strong of a company, with too much growth to not return to the 340-360 range, which is still considered low based on its projections and current valuations.

PSYCHEDELICS - Huge Value for an emerging and disruptive market.,69,lo1imb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1imb/psychedelics_huge_value_for_an_emerging_and/,49,1613832926.0," 

My lowly apes the time has come for our world to evolve and I‚Äôm certain that the psychedelic movement that‚Äôs beginning in the world right now will not fall short. I hope that some of this information is new and that it can help to educate, de-stigmatize, and send a bunch of autists to the moon, mars, and beyond. I am by no means a financial advisor and am a novice investor that made some very impulsive choices around the end of January‚Ä¶ Ive been learning a tonne about this world and am very excited to participate!

I‚Äôll begin by talking about what‚Äôs happening where I am, Victoria BC. I associated with a number of friends that are licensed therapists who have taken risks that are easy to quantify when they consider the efficacy of treatments with MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin, 5-MeO-DMT, kambo, bufo, ayahuasca, and a number of other lesser know research chemicals. From what I hear this is happening throughout out North America and Europe. These professionals are very busy with this new treatment model. With stigma dissolving along side a massive mental health and opioid epidemics, change is coming. Last year a non-profit in Victoria was granted permission to treat 5 patients suffering from end of life anxiety. This happened with a welcome shock and the accounts of those 5 peoples experiences have made some big news. It came without extensive testing in Canada and relied on research from elsewhere. This year regular treatments for depression are happening and the conversation will be in both the Canadian and America governments. Already in the us Oregon has taken big steps and there are a string on states and cities following suit. California, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, and others are taking steps.

Some want to call this the next weed boom and others will not pay attention. I see this as a massive market disruptor and in time will rock big farms boat. My space tripper hairy ass is under the impression that this is the birth of a new Pharma. I see it disrupting liquor, tobacco, health care, and rainbow bear syndrome. Treatments currently are focusing on depression and PTSD (Pharma), smoking cessation , alcoholism, and dietary dissorders. I really think that these industries will be directly affected by a population with an overall higher state of mental health. A healthier population with increased cognitive health will naturally be drawn to other forms of entertainment, like $AMC.

A few weeks ago the NIO exchange launched the first psychedelic eft [https://www.neo.inc/en/live/security-activity/PSYK#!/market-depth](https://www.neo.inc/en/live/security-activity/PSYK#!/market-depth). I currently own 1000 shares of $MMED, 4000 shares $NUMI, and 500 $PSYK. These companies are all operating in purely speculative markets at the moment with no revenue to really speak of, I‚Äôm in it for the long. I picked those tho stocks because of the quality go their teams, their messages, and got feeling that it could make my wife‚Äôs boyfriend very rich one day. The EFT well because I see deep value in this new market.

"INTC: The best move for next week. An incredible, short term opportunity in a high expected value underdog play. üöÄüöÄüöÄ",16,lo1fvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1fvz/intc_the_best_move_for_next_week_an_incredible/,44,1613832614.0,"TLDR: INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options. Intel is experiencing a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced.

Last week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis).

Today I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

INTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Last price for this option contract was at .36$ \* (100) = 36$ per option contract

As of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find ""beating"" this option contract a more than 50% probability.

To illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts.

For every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price.

Reiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.

Now I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space.

Fan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

Sparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math).

Micron: 3.08% upward move contracts < 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.

TSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.

I wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal.

&#x200B;

Now before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**

&#x200B;

This week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%.

Given the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the ""real"" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite.

Similar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks).

The Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market.

I am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win.

I have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term.

For the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them.

This is deep fucking value.  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**  **üöÄ**",2021-02-20 16:50:14

$DASH- DD To End all $DASH DD- BEARS R NOT FUK,30,lo11td,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo11td/dash_dd_to_end_all_dash_dd_bears_r_not_fuk/,15,1613831061.0," 

1. **Introduction:**
   1. First and foremost I want to begin this DD with a disclaimer. I am not a financial advisor. The words following this are merely my own thoughts and should only be consumed for entertainment purposes only. Invest and trade securities at your own risk.
2. **What They Do:**
   1. DoorDash is a food delivery commodity business that works to give consumers and merchants an avenue and one stop shop to place orders and receive food. Door dash makes money from three revenue streams:
      1. The first revenue stream is collected through the fee it charges customers to place orders through their app and website. This fee varies by location and time of day of the order but is generally 5 to 8 dollars per order.
      2. The second stream of revenue is from the commission that DoorDash takes for every order which is paid by the restaurant. Door Dash‚Äôs commissions on restaurant orders are about 20% per order which is among the highest in the industry. Grubhub in contrast takes roughly 13.5% commission per order.
      3. Their final stream of revenue comes from advertisements. What I mean by this is that restaurants pay door dash to appear at the top of the search results on the website and their app platform. 
3. **Industry Outlook:** DoorDash is not the only food commodity delivery service that is good at throwing money into the furnace. However they are by far the most efficient at it and despite this fact they are the most euphorically valued company in the space compared to Uber Eats, Grubhub, and other local miscellaneous food and commodity delivery platforms. For instance in 2019 DASHs revenue was $885,000,000 dollars whereas grubhub‚Äôs revenue was 1.312 billion. Dash posted a net loss of $616,000,000 whereas grubhub posted a loss of $6,283,000. 2018 is the same story with DASH bringing in revenue of $291,000,000 and posting a loss of $210,000,000 whereas grub hub brought in 1B in revenue and actually posted a net profit of roughly 81.5million. One thing we can take away from grubhub‚Äôs positive earnings in 2018 is that profit margins in this industry are going to be SLIM at best until a new delivery paradigm such as autonomous drone delivery services and logistics can be profitably utilized. However, I will talk about those prospects shortly.
4. **Financials:**
   1. It is not new information knowing that DoorDash is a money incinerator. But just how much money is DASH losing every year? To give the an unbiased picture I am going to summarize  the positives and negatives of their financials
   2. **The Positives:**
      1. From 2018 to 2019 DASHs gross profit increased from just 63 million in 2018 to 362 million in 2019 showing a 574% YoY  increase. Their TTM gross profit in 2020 is estimated at 1.145 billion. This is a 316 % increase from their 2019 gross profit. Their overall revenue is also increasing as they posted a revenue of $291,000,000 in 2018, $885,000,000 in 2019, and a TTM estimated revenue of approximately $2.214B in 2020(the exact numbers will be made clear on their earnings which I talk about later)
   3. **The Negatives:** 
      1. DASHs gross profit increases YoY seem to be bullish on the surface, but when you consider the fact that the black swan event, COVID 19, played a huge role in boosting their earnings this year it does not bode well for their future growth. The decreasing YoY profit percentage is not only indicative of growth and profit slowing as they expand their business, but their profit can be expected to decrease looking forward as the extended closings of restaurants due to COVID is creating a demand backlog for patronage for in house meals and services. 
      2. Also despite multiplying their gross profit five fold from 2018 and 2019 and three fold from 2019 to 2020, DASH still has no clear path to profitability as they posted net losses of 210 million in 2018, 616 million in 2019, and TTM losses of an estimated 268 million in 2020. 
      3. DASH spent an estimate of 270 million dollars on research and development from 2018 to September 30, 2020. But what is DASH, a non technological company researching and developing. NOTHING. DOOR DASH is actually most likely investing this money into OTHER companies that are developing the technology for autonomous and drone delivery, meaning that the increased revenue stream from subscribing, leasing, or buying drone and autonomous technologies from these companies must outweigh the prices they pay for them. Considering the logistics of fully autonomous drone delivery and the legislation surrounding such technologies, the fruits of these investments and developments may not be seen for the next 5-10 years at the EARLIEST.

 

1. **Upcoming Earnings:** DASH is expected to post earnings on February 25, 2021 after market close. Their expected earnings are expected to be -0.75 cents per share.
2. **Lock Up Expiry:** 
   1. Per their IPO, DOORDASH issued 33,000,000 class A common stock shares and raised approximately 3.27 Billion in proceeds after paying underwriting fees and commissions. Each share was offered at a price of 102 dollars per share. 
   2. This next bit is important: **Prior to the IPO there were 284,656,521 existing shares held by insiders.** The average price of those shares were $8.73. This means that even if the price is at $128 by March 9 which  is barely above the $127.50 share price needed for the early lock up expiry to be valid , insiders will be able to sell off their 20% shares at 1600% ROI. However this is not the full story.
   3. 33,000,000 plus 284,656,521 will equal the total outstanding float of **317,656,521 shares.** 
   4. **The above outstanding float DOES NOT include the following**
      1. 34,554,510 shares issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase class A common stock with an average exercise price of $2.41 per share. 
      2. 20,021,420 shares of class A common stock subject to RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) outstanding prior to September 30 2020
      3. 14,003,990 shares of Class A common stock subject to RSUs granted AFTER September 30 2020 (10,379,000 of which are granted to the CEO Mr.Tony Xu, that vest when DASH hits certain stock price goals)
      4. 105,330 shares of class A common stock issued upon the exercise of warrants (average price of $1.492 per share)
      5. 39,722,785 shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under their equity compensation plans.
      6. Totaling a whopping **108,408,035 possible more shares that can enter the float.** If we subtract the RSUs and  shares reserved for future issuance we get **34,659,840 shares that will enter the total outstanding float possibly in a short period** when stock options and warrants are exercised and redeemed for class A common stock.
   5. **Conditions of the Lock Up Expiry**
      1. such date is at least **90 days after December 9 2020**
      2. such date occurs after they have  publicly furnished at least one earnings release on Form 8-K or filed at least one periodic report with the SEC
      3. on such date, and for **5 out of any 10 consecutive trading days** ending on such date, the last reported closing price of our **Class A common stock is at least 25% greater than $102**
      4. Such a date occurs in an open trading window and there are at least five trading days remaining in the open trading window.
      5. WTF IS A TRADING WINDOW:
      6. ANSWER: Trading windows are set in a company's insider trading policies. The SEC has no specific rules about the opening and closing of trading windows. These stipulations vary from company to company and can be found in each company‚Äôs Insider Trading Policy document. In general, they typically open a couple days AFTER a big announcement or event like an earnings report or an acquisition or a declaration of bankruptcy etc. 
      7. I could not for the life of me find DASHs Insider Trading Policy but if we assume that their open trading window occurs on the second full day of trading after their earning report that would put the opening of the window on March 1 2020. Trading Window times can vary between 2 to 6 weeks long so their window will encompass the lock up expiry.
      8. Also there is no need to rush or calculate the day of the lock up because **‚ÄúWe will announce both the Early Lock-Up Expiration Date and the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8-K at least two full trading days before it is effective.‚Äù** This is straight from the prospectus.
   6. **Amount of new shares eligible for sale after lockup expiry**
      1. 95,709,974 shares of Class A common stock held by former holders of their redeemable convertible preferred stock.
      2. 6,262,890 shares of class A common stock held by members of their board of directors and members of their management team.
      3. 11,889,744 shares of class A common stock held by all other holders.
      4. Total number of new shares available for trading after early lock up: **113,862,608.** This means that **upon early lock up expiration, the amount of tradable shares on the open market will increase to 146,862,608 shares.** This is nearly 4.5 times the amount of shares that are currently trading on the market with **most of those shares being held by insiders,** **and early investors** looking to collect on their investment which will translate to **major selling volume.**
3. **Competitors:** The biggest company that most reflects DASH is GrubHub. Uber is a car hailing service that tried to pass itself off as an emerging technology company that was developing autonomous driving technology but that has been shown to be a stretch of the imagination. However Uber still trades at about 8x sales multiple. GRUB trades at about 4x sales multiple. DASH is trading at 30x sales multiple. However, some justifications for this price are that DASH has higher market share than Uber or GRUB and deserve a premium for their dominance in industry but this just can not be true. Food commodity delivery is not an industry in which there is much differentiation. The leading factor for consumer choice over which app to open is entirely dependent on which company is offering the **cheapest price for delivery**. This includes the prices that restaurants have to pay in order to use their services. **DASH has some of the highest commission rates in the country for food delivery platforms**. If they cannot compete in this arena they will quickly lose market share to businesses that are willing to take lower commission for more traffic through their site. In an industry with hardly any real MOAT from any competitor, companies will devolve into a race to see who can remain solvent longer than another as commissions to restaurants and prices to consumers drops which will of course make these businesses even more unprofitable. 
4. **Price Target: Bearish/Conservative/Bullish:**
   1. **Bearish:**
      1. DASH begins to lose the race to the bottom as their highest in industry commissions to restaurants cause them to lose market share disproportionately. A bearish estimate of 3x sales would put DASH at about 6.5B market cap or $21 a share
   2. **Conservative:**
      1. DASH bites the bullet and begins slashing prices, which results in decreasing profitability but they maintain an even split of market share between big competitors putting them at the industry average of 5-6x sales multiple or 12B valuation for approximately $40 a share.
   3. **Bullish:**
      1. DASH stops paying 5 million dollars to advertise donating 1 million dollars to charity and starts thinking critically and regain market share by slashing research and development as they wait for other companies to invent drones for them since they clearly aren't going to do it themselves and slash prices harder than competitors to reclaim far greater market share. Having twice the market share of their competitors could put them at a generous 12x sales multiple or $24B valuation for a share price of $80 per share. 
5. **Positions:** I have been slowly building my positions in DASH beginning this past week and will continue to monitor the run up prior to earnings and take advantage of IV by selling ITM Call Credit Spreads and using a portion of that money to buy Far OTM puts. My current positions are 14 Call Credit Spreads 185/190 March 19 2021; 1x 160P May 21 2021; 4x 140P May 21 2021
6. **Conclusion:** Major selling pressure upon the release of the shares after lock up as well as the 4 fold increase of  shares that will be tradeable on the float will contribute to heavy selling pressure. If the lock up does not occur that means the price is below 127.50 and I already reach max profit on the spreads and major gains on the puts. I will continue to add positions especially as it continues to touch the heavy resistance in the 220s.

I cant believe that I haven‚Äôt heard anything here n WSB‚Ä¶

This is my f..kin research:

1-Student debt is about 1.6 trillion, which 92% is from the Federal Government and the rest is from private institucions (SLM and NAVI)

2- The private debt rises to 128 billions, and the institutions in charge of managing this debt (SLM & NAVI) have a market cap of 10B, which means that any little f..kin mistake coulf fck them up.

3-SLM and NAVI (specially SLM) are creating SLABS (student loans asset backed securities), which are the same shit as the mortages back in 2008. SLABS have a really optimistic rating despite the increasing unemployment rate, inflation, and ZERO credit score from the students (most of the students who gets students loans doesn‚Äôt even have a credit card or other credit instrument‚Ä¶ which means that the student loan is the first credit in their lives without even having a credit background!)

4- The underwriter from the SLABS are JPM, GS, DEUTCHE, MORGAN, ETC‚Ä¶ same institutions that didn‚Äôt give a fuck back in 2008.

5- Biden student debt relief could be quite beneficial for the student debt ecosystem‚Ä¶ which means that SLM and NAVI would be the ones most beneficed, increasing their stock price to the moon.

6. I don‚Äôt get why no one is talking about this! THIS IS HAPPENING RN AND IT IS REAL!

I am buying 10k in LEAPS for 2023‚Ä¶ what do you think about this topic? Wanna know if I am crazy or actually fckin right!

GME sequence of events (yes the game was rigged we retail traders got screwed):

GME is way over shorted > brokers allowed this > squeeze happens, hedge fund lose tons of money and face insolvency > Citadel gives $3 billion to Melvin Capital, despite the fact they are supposed to be a neutral market maker > price keeps surging > Melvin faces insolvency and will lose Citadel's investment, Citadel is no longer a neutral player > clearinghouses get leaned on by powerful suits to raise margin requirements on GME > brokers will have to make up the losses of the shorts they allowed to occur > they decide to save their own skin at the expense of their clients and rig the trade > instead of going to thousands per share as INKR ceo admitted it would have, retail is robbed of billions in gains

**Now on to the silver post**

This is a very long post, so I apologize to the WSB apes who can barely read and will have to scroll a long way to get to the TLDR. Its also been impossible to post about silver lately on WSB (no posts approved, thanks to the mod who assisted this one), so I crammed about 3-4 posts worth into this one.  Not sure when I'll be allowed to post again.

I've organized this post into 4 sections so feel free to skip around to the parts you are interested in.

1. The silver short squeeze evidence
2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS
3. The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed
4. TLDR, what to buy if you want to go long silver

Since my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/) on the potential for a silver short squeeze, I have been researching the topic to prepare a more detailed and substantiated update post.  This is my latest attempt to post, and hopefully this one gets to stay up (silver censorship has been a thing here lately)

**1.  The potential for a short squeeze (573% of the 'float' is currently sold short)**

The big thing to remember here is that if enough market participants who are long silver contracts in the futures market begin to demand delivery of their silver, there will absolutely be a meltup in the price  because there simply isn't enough supply available.

**The next 3 trading days are critical, and there is war being waged.  The shorts and COMEX are in a fight for their lives, and barely hanging on by a thread**

Many big name precious metals veterans have bemoaned for years about how the size of the 'paper' silver market absolutely dwarfs the amount of silver that could be delivered, and thus the market is manipulated.  The vast majority of futures and options contracts in the silver market have historically been settled via cash.  Meaning no physical silver is actually delivered when these contracts are set to expire. This is where the talk of the 100-1 and 250-1 paper silver to physical silver ratios comes from, but short interest is actually more like 6-1 on the COMEX using open interest data through the next two big delivery months.

Technically every month is eligible for deliveries, but only months with options interest tend to have any real volume, and that's why they are known as delivery months.  March and May are options expiration months, while April is not.

If you want to think about it like a stock, **the short interest is 573% of the 'float'**.  This is based on the fact that over the next 3 months there are futures contracts and options which have the right to take delivery of 847 million ounces of silver.  This is compared to only 147 million ounces registered on the COMEX that could fulfil these deliveries.  For perspective, GME short interest peaked at around 140% of its float, and that was considered crazy high.  It is widely known that if a small, but significant share of long silver contract holders took delivery, that there would not be enough silver, as the demand would cascade higher and higher as the prices rise.

(sources: [silver stocks report](https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls),  [futures open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/volume-open-interest/metals-volume.html), [options open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/open-interest-heatmap.html), data as of 2-18 was used in this post)

This would be similar to a bank run scenario.  The COMEX is the silver bank, and they have printed too many paper claims on a limited amount of silver.  If there is no actual silver left to be delivered to the holders of the futures contracts, that means that means that the COMEX would default and settle their contracts in cash.  No one wants to get settled in cash if the COMEX had to default.  This would mean that right as you want to be able to stay long silver, as the price is surging higher, that you will get forced out and paid cash instead of silver and wouldn't benefit from future increases in the price.  The traders who want to stay long silver and who see the run occurring would try to take delivery because if you actually have physical silver in your vault then it doesn't matter if the COMEX goes down, you still have your actual silver you can sell on the spot market.  Most importantly to them, they get to keep participating in the upside.

Now the shorts are very much trying to keep the price down at the moment, because their problems get worse as the price rises and more options become in the money.  See the chart below, with a handy arrow to illustrate where we are currently in terms of March open interest.

As the price rises more and more, the short interest grows as more options on futures contracts become 'in the money', compounding problems for the shorts. This is the silver version of a gamma squeeze.

The chart below shows the number of ounces that would be eligible for delivery over the next 3 months, given the current open interest data.  Most of the open interest comes from futures contracts that aren't dependent on price, but I've made this chart to illustrate how the problems get worse for the shorts due to the options contracts as the price rises.  The latest silver price as I'm writing this is $27.37.

But why would contract holders all of a sudden start to demand delivery when cash settlement has historically been the norm?  A couple of reasons.

The first reason is arbitrage.  Premiums on 1000oz bars have surged to somewhere between $1 and $2 an ounce (this is unheard of on the 1000oz commercial bars), meaning that traders can stand for delivery and then sell in the physical market for immediate profit.  When supply had become constrained in previous silver bull markets these premiums were more like 30 cents an ounce.

In addition, mints are also interested in arbitrage.  They could begin to take delivery to break down 1000oz commercial bars into smaller units which currently trade at historic premiums of $5-$8 an ounce.  The small unit silver market has experienced greater demand than ever before.  The entire stock of small unit silver was sold out at all dealers a few weeks ago.  The small amounts they do get in stock are only sold at massive premiums.

The second reason traders may take delivery is because they see the massive opportunity presenting itself right now, and they don't want to be cash settled when the COMEX defaults. They see that the squeeze is possible and that they profit massively by simply taking delivery, sitting on their silver while the squeeze happens, and then reselling it at much higher prices.  Early rumblings of massively increased delivery volume is already presenting itself in the data.  See the chart below showing the past 3 months of deliveries compared with the same time period in previous years

&#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will rise further](https://preview.redd.it/wbnqokjdaki61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=377e6edd51e631a3e41345a7fe41e9b43b6c1ff4)

Note that this chart corresponds with December of the previous year through February of the year that is labeled on the x-axis.  So 2016 actually represents December of 2015 through February of 2016.

It seems that the silver futures market is suddenly becoming a place where silver actually gets delivered in meaningful quantities.  This trend is even more pronounced when you look at just the most recent month of February, which like April was not an options expiration month, and thus typically has very low volume.  Even still, the increased interest in taking delivery of silver from the COMEX is very clear.   And historic at that.

&#x200B;

[\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will rise further](https://preview.redd.it/dcyupx9eaki61.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5d6cc1eee6762b32b680a83953f858e24f1884)

February 2021 has had 9.95 million ounces delivered through 2-18, and there is still 1.83 million ounces in open interest.  Anyone still sitting in a contract this late in the month wants delivery, so we can safely assume Feb. deliveries will end above 11 million, and closer to 12 million.   This is compared with an average of only 2.20 million ounces delivered in the previous 3 Februaries. An increase of roughly 422% (assuming 11.5 million delivered).

March is gearing up to potentially be an earth shattering month for delivery requests that could send silver soaring.  March in the previous 3 years has averaged 26.79 million ounces delivered.  If this year's month of March experienced the same 422% increase in deliveries that occurred in February, that would represent \~140 million ounces delivered.  Enough to completely drain the COMEX registered stocks.  If typical contract roll-forward behavior persists, we are actually on track to hit around that number.  The chart below shows how March is on track to finish the month with between 30-40k contracts demanding delivery (each contract represents 5,000 oz).  Chart is courtesy of  [u/Ditch\_the\_DeepState](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ditch_the_DeepState/) who does an awesome job with these.

The final day to roll contracts forward to not be eligible for March delivery is Wednesday, February 24th.  Given these are not normal times in terms of deliveries, it would not surprise me to see the decline for OI in March flatten out and stun the world by finishing with 40k contracts awaiting delivery.  The COMEX only has registered stocks to cover 29.4k.

And let's say the COMEX survives March and is able to meet all the delivery requests, this is what the May open interest looks like. Can you imagine the COMEX going into May with only 20 or 30 million registered ounces staring down the barrel of 450+ million ounces of open interest (and this figure will rise once March passes and/or the price rise causes more call options to be ITM).  At this point the long in May would absolutely stand for delivery and hope they are one of the lucky few who aren't force settled in Cash.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muy8rywfaki61.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=7961cd1fc214234bafaa904b26838aa4f325b38a

So even if only half or three-fourths of the 147 million available ounces are delivered, the May contract holders will see that the available supply is shrinking fast, creating even more demand for physical delivery because the opportunity is that much more clear for a continued short squeeze.  That and the fact that there are longs who really do want the silver for various reasons, and would be worried that the COMEX will default and there will be no silver available for delivery at all.

This is where critics of the potential for a short squeeze may point out that if the COMEX starts to run out of silver, they will just find more.  This is increasingly not an option however.  The primary stores of 1000oz bars are the LBMA vaults in London, and the COMEX.  When the COMEX starts experiencing high demand for gold or silver deliveries (typically due to the existence of premiums between paper and physical and a phenomenon known as backwardation), traders start chartering planes to deliver excess metal from the LBMA to the COMEX.  This occurred in March and April for gold and silver when physical started trading at premiums and traders began to demand delivery.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yx29yi4haki61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80b919308dd74d37bec785e69eca614ac75cb83

The problem with this line of thought is that nearly all of the silver in the LBMA is effectively allocated already.  The most common silver ETFs such as SLV use the LBMA silver vaults to allocate silver to their ETFs, and recent historic inflows to these ETFs has created a situation where the LBMA simply does not have unallocated supply that they will be able to ship to the COMEX.  Bullionstar.com recently ran an article showing that 85% of the silver in the LBMA was now held by silver ETFs that utilize the LBMA stores. This means that this Silver cannot be taken from the LBMA to reinforce the registered stocks of the COMEX.

Also notice how last spring/summer is when LBMA inventory (shown in green) dropped, which aligns with when the silver price surged and increased COMEX deliveries were happening (2020 was a record year for deliveries).

&#x200B;

The LMBA is estimated to contain 1.08 billion ounces of silver.  Meaning that 162 million ounces aren't already allocated to ETFs.  Not known though, is how much of this 162 million ounces is owned by wealthy individuals and family offices who already have a claim to it.  Indeed, the supply situation at the LBMA is dire enough that the worlds largest silver ETF, SLV, had to change it's prospectus to mention that they may not be able to find silver to allocate to their ETF in the near future.  They made this change on 2/3 following historic inflows, but didn't make the document public until 2/8 for some reason.  Nor did they announce the change.

Another decently sized silver ETF that I can't mention also changed their prospectus and directly mentioned that there might be a short squeeze and actually seems to sympathize with the hedge funds who would potentially be 'hurt' in the process

So why did JPM feel the need to [downgrade silver](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/miners-tumble-as-jpmorgan-downgrades-sector-and-silver-prices-slide-from-eight-year-high-11612259966) just as it started to spike, why did the CFTC feel the need to [raise margin requirements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/cme-raises-comex-silver-futures-margins-by-18-effective-feb-2) the very same day, and why did Goldman feel the [need to publish an article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/goldman-sachs-says-it-would-be-impossible-for-retail-traders-to-short-squeeze-silver.html) saying the squeeze was impossible, also on the same day?  They are terrified the squeeze of the naked shorts in the silver market might actually happen.  Just as the ETFs are now warning in their prospectuses.

The report from Goldman made the ludicrous claim that each member of WSB would need to purchase 4,200 ounces of silver to cause a squeeze.  Assuming approximately 8 million members at the time, that's roughly 33.6 billion ounces of silver, and at $27.37 an ounce, would represent $920 billion worth of silver.

There is a myth that the silver market is as large as $1.5 trillion in total, which is probably where Jeff Currie from Goldman somehow came up with this $920 billion figure.  This is a vast overstatement of the available investment grade silver.  These figures represent the grand total of all silver that has ever been mined in the history of the world. The overwhelming majority of this silver has been used in the production of various electronics, medical devices, and other products and simply cannot be recovered (20oz of silver are used in every electric vehicle btw).  Maybe at $500 an ounce, dumps will begin to look for phones and other electronics and try to chemically separate the miniscule amounts of silver from each device, but at $27 an ounce this is completely unrealistic.  Even then, it would be a minimum 6 months to get silver recycled from these devices and into the 1000oz bar format that is required for the futures market.

If you look at various sources (google it), most of them estimate the entire quantity of investable silver in the world is somewhere between 2.8 and 4 billion ounces if you include the small denominations of silver (which can't be used to deliver on the COMEX).  Using the high end estimate at 4 billion ounces, this would mean the entire investment grade silver market is only valued at $109 billion. The futures market only deals with 1000oz bars of which there is estimated to only be 2 billion ounces worth.

**There are only 0.36 to 0.52 investment grade ounces of silver per person in the world if you include both the small denominations and the 1000oz bars together. At $27.37 an ounce this is only $9.85 to $14.23 worth of investment grade silver per person.**  Go take a stroll through some of the silver forums on reddit and you'll see people are buying 6 figures worth regularly right now.

The allocated *and* unallocated silver in the LBMA and COMEX in total is roughly 1.5 billion ounces, which is a far cry from the 33.6 billion that Goldman is referring to.  As I have mentioned, most of this 1.5 billion ounces is already allocated to owners as well.

Think about 2 billion ounces worth of silver in 1000oz format. That is a tiny, tiny number.  At current prices it represents $55 billion.  There are only 2 million 1000oz bars, and each one costs roughly $27,710.

**There is another asset that has been in the news recently that is over 55k in price (WSB bans mentioning it, I'm not trying to pump it, just use it for an example).  There are only \~21 million of these items that will ever be mined, and they are valued for their scarcity and deflationary tendency.  For every ten of these** ***things which shall not be named*** **there is only** ***one*** **1000oz commercial silver bar, and each bar costs roughly half of what 1 of the** ***things that shall not be named*** **costs.**

To say that silver could not have an epic surge in the same way, despite being 10x more scarce, and half the price at that, is ludicrous. Silver is used in production of actual real things and the supply over a long enough period will actually be entirely exhausted unless we figure out how to economically mine asteroids (which would only be economical at silver prices far beyond what's ever been achieved).

As part of my research for this post I was actually able to get in touch with silver industry veteran, David Morgan (thanks for answering a random guy's twitter DM David).  He told me an anecdote from back in the previous run-up during 2010-11 where he had a conversation with Eric Sprott who mentioned that Sprott Inc's purchase of just 22 million commercial ounces to start their ETF of PSLV was enough to drive up the price by over $2 an ounce.  Unlike the other silver ETFs which just allocate silver off of the LBMA, PSLV actually sources silver in the open market to add to their vaults, which is why investing in PSLV can actually cause the silver price to rise much more directly than the other ETFs.

So who is on the other side of this trade? Banks and large hedge funds, who are massively [net short silver](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f), to the tune of 91,468 contracts sold short compared with only 16,071 contracts long.  The banks are trying to make sure the price stays low so that they can discourage run ups in the price that would create a short squeeze (and cause them to experience massive losses on their naked short positions).

If you want more proof that these markets are historically manipulated look at the fines [JPM had to pay recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty/jpmorgan-to-pay-920-million-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market-idUSKBN26K325).  Which brings me to part 2.

&#x200B;

**2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS**

Several posts have documented the timeline of Silver posts on WSB and why the narrative of hedge funds pushing silver to hurt GME doesn't really make sense.

Here's a couple of them that I personally liked (and there are many more): [one from u/johnnycleveland](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [another from u/blipblopbloop11](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/lhqk6p/100_proof_the_antisilver_movement_in_wsb_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Besides the fact that many on WSB were fans of silver long before the GME craze (including myself), banks have a massive net short position in silver (which I cover later in this post).  At the time the anti-silver post went viral about Citadel having a large position in SLV, it comprised only 0.04% of their AUM, and they actually had **3 times this amount, 0.13% of AUM, in** ***PUTS*** **ON SLV.**  [Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Kw2Bac).  So it doesn't make sense for them to try and stop one short squeeze that hurts them by causing a second short squeeze that would also hurt them.

I'm not sure if hedge fund bots were actually driving the anti-silver propaganda, or if it just caught on because people wanted a scapegoat for the GME losses, but either way it seems like silver was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The people investing in silver, and the people investing in GME are natural allies.  Its a mix of a desire for tendies and giving big banks and hedge funds the finger.

Why weren't AMC, BB, NOK, weed stocks, and many other popular positions not considered distractions from GME?  Wouldn't GME have gone much higher if everyone on WSB had stuck to only GME and not these other plays?

**There was absolutely institutional collusion to prevent GME from getting the infinity squeeze it was set up to get.**  The interactive brokers CEO even said on live TV that ""the price was headed to infinity"" if they hadn't stepped in to ""stop the losses"".

This collusion is simply unrelated to the fact that some of us on WSB also like the silver market setup.  I totally agree that media reports of WSB 'moving to silver' were somewhat poorly worded.  Just as the reports of WSB moving to weed stocks were poorly worded.  Some people on WSB are playing silver, some are playing weed stocks, but these headlines make it sound like it's everyone when it's never true that all of WSB is long a single trade (GME may have been close though).  I understand frustration about poor reporting.  Please don't take it out on your fellow WSB apes though.

And if you are still holding GME and think it can squeeze again, I respect that and I still hope it goes to $1,000 and higher.

&#x200B;

**3.  The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed**

First of all, as previously mentioned, the short side of the equation is almost entirely made up of banks and hedge funds, so keep that in mind when you might have sympathy for the shorts here.

Second, the demonetization of silver was used as a blunt instrument to impoverish the populace, and enrich the wealthy and bankers all the way back in 1873.  We know that wealth is generational, so if you had family living in the United States prior to 1873, and they were not wealthy, it is highly likely that they were massively impoverished by banker related corruption at the time.  Here's a quick rundown of what happened:

Originally both gold and silver were considered legal tender in the United States.

The monetary base was roughly half comprised of gold and half comprised of silver, with a fixed exchange rate of 15 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold.  Because silver was more common, it was considered the common currency of exchange with gold only being used by the wealthy in large transactions.

In 1873 a bill was signed to demonetize silver, while keeping gold as legal tender.

All of the common people had their savings in silver which became increasingly worth less relative to gold, while all of the wealthy had their savings in gold, so the value of their savings appreciated.

In line with the removal of 50% of the monetary base, we experienced roughly 50% deflation over the next few decades.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/820we95vaki61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf544d3e52a83cda7f1e985c924e668738fc2c07

Along with this deflation though, the value of debt also rose.  So if you were poor, and also likely indebted, with one stroke of a pen your money began to become worthless while at the same time your debt became progressively worth more due to deflation.  If you were a wealthy gold owner, or a bank, you likely owned that debt that became worth more alongside the gold you already held.  A double win for the wealthy, and a double hit for the poor.  One stroke of a pen created generational wealth for some, and generational poverty for others.

**Yet another reason squeezing silver, with banks on the other side of the trade would be true cosmic justice.**

Fundamentally, there are plenty of reasons why silver demand long term will rise.  On the industrial demand side, silver is used in solar panels, electric vehicles, other electronics of all kinds, and expensive space related items, where getting 100% electricity conduction is worth it compared with the second best metal of copper at 97%.  These industries are expected to grow quickly in the next decade and more silver will be needed for this reason.

Monetarily, the money supply is expanding at historic rates and most of the 'smartest people in the room' are calling for higher inflation in the next few years.  Pretty much every commodity except gold and silver have been on an absolute tear the last few months and they are breaking out into what most consider multi-year bull market cycles.  This will drive inflation even further.

Silver is more common than gold but spread rather thin in the earth's crust so it isn't mined directly in large quantities.  It's more typically a byproduct of mining for other raw materials. The lack of dedicated silver mines means that silver today is mined at only an 8-1 ratio to gold despite naturally occurring at roughly 18.75-1 ratio.  Silver is currently trading at a 66-1 ratio to gold, and gold hasn't even been rising lately.  In the 2010-2011 run we got down to a 30-1 ratio, and if people begin to worry about inflation and consider silver a monetary hedge, there's nothing stopping silver from getting to its natural ratio of 18.75-1 or even lower considering the industrial demand combined with the lower 8-1 production ratio.

These lower ratios combined with higher gold prices in the future mean that silver can realistically get above $50 in short order, possibly even above $100, and if you think the monetary system is really headed downhill, even up to the outrageous forecasts of $500+ from the likes of Patrick Karim on twitter.  Note that Patrick posts various charts all the time and his most recent forecast is $182 silver by 2023. Love your charts Patrick (give this man a follow).

**In the end, the goal of buying silver should be to make tendies and to end the manipulation of these markets. We need to get to the point where entering into a contract to sell silver means you actually have the physical silver to sell.  No more naked shorting and profiteering off the little people. An honest silver market is the ultimate goal here.**

&#x200B;

**4. TLDR, what to buy**

To get the most secure, best value for your dollar in terms of silver I would personally prioritize purchases in the following order (others may prioritize differently and that's ok):

1. Take delivery on the futures market if you are able (no premiums, but only available to large players)
2. Purchase shares of the PSLV ETF who will then purchase 1000oz bars
3. Purchase 1000oz bars at retail if you can find them for reasonable premiums
4. Purchase smaller units of silver if the premiums come down to 15% or less.  There are roughly 1-2 billion ounces of small unit silver in the world that don't directly impact the 1000oz bar market, but demand for them does cause premiums to soar, which can then cause mints to purchase 1000oz bars to smelt into smaller pieces. This is also the preferred option for those who are concerned with the total collapse of the fiat monetary system and other doomsday scenarios.  Personally I'm just wanting honest markets and to make tendies which is why this ranks 4th on my list.
5. Purchase other silver ETFs such as SLV.  Purchasing these will at least theoretically take silver off of the LBMA, but recent disclosures from these ETFs are making them seem less trustworthy (note that there is no definitive proof of any kind of fraud from these ETFs)
6. Riskier Alternatives:  Purchasing shares of silver miners, calls on silver miners, and even calls on the other silver ETFs are all riskier bets and potentially more profitable short term.  This is likely what many here at WSB are going to do

Disclosure: I am long silver miners and silver ETFs at this time

As you  scroll past the densest paragraphs of this dd you may realize this 'company' has terrible reviews. There are stories of managers backstabbing and corporate culture dumpster fires. Employees are overworked and underpaid. The people who handle the product reportedly have little regard for the cosmetic quality of the cars. Many customers have had problems with their purchases.

And so what?!

It's apparently *illegal to sell cars unless you have a special license*. Do you have a license to auction cars? I didn't think so. Guess who does have a license to auction cars?

If there was any room in this industry for disruption in the form of reform it certainly would have happened by now. For this company to cling so effectively and desperately to life through all this shows the same kind of resilience that went into the final evolutionary form of a cockroach's thorax. Is it pretty? No. Can it survive a nuclear bomb? Maybe.

With all these uncertain things happening on the stock market we may have a whole new market for affordable vehicles that cut out expensive dealership middlemen like this company does. 

And let me remind you of the movie Looper. In this movie we are shown cars that have been retrofitted with new parts to make them compliant with industry standards. Given that this is science fiction I realize it's unrelated but I just thought it was cool. 

Anyway, KAR may take a few months to recover but they're already in the space and there's nothing to innovate here. Car dealerships are an old boys club and if you don't have a ticket you can just forget joining in. Ticket prices just dropped to sub $15 a share.

And who doesn't love a good old American car auction?!

DD: Good and Undervalued Companies in an Expensive Market.,27,lnwuq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnwuq0/dd_good_and_undervalued_companies_in_an_expensive/,30,1613816412.0,"SPOILER ALERT: no get-rich-quick DD below but some good old boring value investing shit that won't give you a hard-on even if you were on double your normal dose of Viagra watching your wife getting on with her bf. 

**TLDR:  at these levels, CACC and EPAM could give you at least 15% return a year for the next 10 years while NOAH and TPL could give you over 30%.**

I scanned the whole US stock market\* to find good and predictable companies selling below what I think is their fair value. Phil Town first presented these steps in his book ""Rule#1""

According to Phil, a company is predictable when it has\*\*: 

* 10-Year median ROIC (%) > 10%. 
* 10-Year median Revenue growth rate > 10%.
* 10-Year median EPS growth rate > 10%. 
* 10-Year median Book (equity) growth rate > 10%
* 10-Year median FCF growth rate > 10%

*There are only 44 companies trading in the US that satisfy these requirements.*

Let's now calculate their fair value assuming a 15% return per year for the next 10 years. 

This is done by following the steps below\*\*\*:

1. Get the 10-Year Book growth rate
2. Get the current EPS
3. Grow the current EPS at the 10-Year Book growth rate, for 10 years
4. Calculate the PE ratio in 10 years by doubling the 10-Year book growth ratio
5. Multiply the EPS in 10 years by the PE in 10 years to obtain the future market price
6. Discount the future market price so that it will give you 15% return for the next 10 years.

I know we are all retards so apologies for being testing the limit of our brainpower with these calculations.

I personally modified Step 1 and 6 to be more conservative. For Step 1) I consider the minimum between the 10-Year Book growth rate and 10-Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate, for Step 4) I consider the minimum between the double of the 10-Year Book growth ratio and the 10-Year median PE Ratio without NRI. 

Step 6) gives us what Phil calls the ""Sticker Price"" which is the price the company should be selling right now, to give a 15% return a year for the next 10 years. But because things don't always go as planned, as they didn't for your marriage, we divide the Sticker Price by a Margin of safety (MoS). Phil likes to use 50%, I personally use 30% because I am more conservative when I calculate the Sticker Price.

***There are only 4 companies*** **that would give us at least 15% return for the next 10 years, with a MoS of 30%, and these are: CACC, EPAM, NOAH and TPL.** 

NOAH and TPL are the most undervalued and they could produce a 30% return a year for the next 10 years if they don't fuck things up! 

That's all.

If you want, I uploaded my spreadsheet here: [https://easyupload.io/zvjhi6](https://easyupload.io/zvjhi6)  \- password: yourwifesname

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*I've used [https://www.gurufocus.com/screener](https://www.gurufocus.com/screener)

\*\*Phil uses these numbers because they tell us that the company has been growing, constantly, at a good and sustainable pace and has used well its capital, for the past 10 years. Can we be sure that it will keep doing so in the future? No! That's why we use a Margin of Safety.

\*\*\*EXAMPLE using CACC (data from the 01/01/2021).([https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CACC/summary](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CACC/summary)) 

Today, CACC closed at $366.07. The 10-Year Book growth rate, which gives us an idea of how much the company could keep growing each year, for the next 10 years, is 23.9%. As I said above I personally consider the minimum between the 10-Year Book growth rate (23.9%) and 10-Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate (22.1%). Then we grow the current EPS at that rate (22.1%). 

The current EPS is $22.95, if I grow this at 22.1% a year for 10 years I get an EPS in 10 years of $169.02. 

To get the price in 10 years I need the PE ratio in 10 years. Phil uses double the 10-Year Book growth rate, so if we had 23.9%, he would use a PE ratio of 47.8. I use the minimum between the double of the 10-Year Book growth ratio and the 10-Year median PE Ratio without NRI so in this case 44.2

Once we have the EPS in 10 years ad the PE ratio in 10 years, we can get the price of the company in 10 years by doing (P/E) \* EPS = P. In this case 44.2\*169.02 = $2143.18  
We get this price and we discount it back to today, assuming a 15% return a year. Like this we get the Sticker Price which is the price at which the share should sell to give us a 15% return a year for the next 10 years. In this example this would be $529.76.

We then apply a Margin of Safety (Phil uses 50%, I use 30%) to 529.76, you get the entry price of $370.83. We are just below that ;)

$AMC Diamond Hands Trade Idea (earnings next week),90,lnwjmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnwjmr/amc_diamond_hands_trade_idea_earnings_next_week/,32,1613815437.0,"Hello WSB,

I come before you to present an $AMC trade that will ensure shares are held through earnings AND will help in the event that the stock tanks even further. The only cost is a small bit of margin needed to hold the position for each put sold ($50).

On the option chain expiring the first week in March, the trade is to sell one put at the 5.50 strike, buy one put at the 5.00 strike and two at the 4.50 strike (ratio backspread basically). I was able to put on this position for a $0.03 credit. Surprising, since I thought OOTM puts would be higher priced going into earnings. You CAN do this with puts expiring next week, but there's almost no time for the trade to develop post-earnings. 

So how does this trade work?

$AMC blows out earnings: Moonshot, short squeeze and the hedged put position expires worthless (you get to keep the small credit). Nothing lost and tendies for all.

$AMC stays stagnant: Position will likely expire worthless, but 5.50 puts could either be closed for cheap or if the stock dips into the 5.50 range, you'll own shares at that price. Not too bad. This is probably the worst scenario.

$AMC tanks: Sell the whole position for a profit, offsetting (paper) losses from the stock. OR sell the long puts and take possession of the shares via assignment of the short put at a cost of 5.50 per share (read: don't waste money covering the short put!). I mean, you WANT more shares anyway for the eventual squeeze. This kills two birds with one stone.

For me, I'm holding 700 AMC shares and I'm holding 15 of the above ratio spreads (short 15 5.50 puts, long 15 5.00 puts, long 30 4.50 puts). I may add to both, depending on how the market behaves.

Good luck with earnings next week. And thank you for this great subreddit!",2021-02-20 12:03:57

As many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze.

*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*

Tom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let‚Äôs play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.

Tom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.

Vlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.

Tom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.

*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*

Finra‚Äôs latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.

So, what is the true short interest then?

Well, let‚Äôs take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024‚Äôs data, check out his DD.

***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \~432.56%.***

Last week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME‚Äôs stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***

Now, I know, lol. Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?

But I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.

If SI really is \~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.

https://preview.redd.it/1xlj4jhdcji61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1ae42ae38e27ff4f6b2b82d8cfe2ffe52654610

If this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.

All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.

So now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don‚Äôt forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.

It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.

We are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.

So, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.

If you are new to investing and jumped in with Robinhood, WeBull, Fidelity or other brokers in GME, AMC, BB, NOK or any other stocks, don't forget to file your 1099-B next year. Or the IRS WILL come for dat ass and if you think investing in risky plays is tarded, wait until you're served with a crisp penalty you can't afford to pay.

Don't think that because you lost money, or ""diDn'T mAkE enOuGh"" you don't have to file it.

You can file yourself or if you're feeling lazy, use TurboTax and most brokers have an auto-import option there. I know Robinhood and Fidelity do, not sure about others.

I won't link to them on here but you can find many stories on Reddit by people who didn't file taxes, did wash sales and all sorts of things that raise red flags with the tax man and you'll see it's all fun and games until it happens to you. Never go full retard.

From this point on there will be no more dips, only green dildos.

From what I've read, which is only on WSB, Palantir is basically an emerging FAANG company. Cathie from Ark just bought like a billion shares. Some say it will go to 100 EOY, some say 200 EOY, I'm going to go with 200. If you disagree, it's because you've been spending too much time on grindr and not enough time reading about PLTR

Quick breakdown on PLTR:

-Multiple new partnership announcements. Both government and private sector contracts.

-Nutty looking CEO with crazy hair who literally lives in a tree house. All he does is think about PLTR mooning when he isn't having sex or doing Qi Gong. He told us that, this is not speculation.

-Company is creating literal skynet that will enslave us in an AI guided techno-hell, but can also do useful stuff like map out vaccine distribution efficiency.

-Jan 26th was their demo day, which helped investors see the value of the software they've been working on. Their website looks like a futuristic disney ride with dots and lines and cool stuff floating around in space.

"DD from Hollywood Film Producer Part II: AMC, Stimulus, and Post-Covid Landscape",101,lntkcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lntkcb/dd_from_hollywood_film_producer_part_ii_amc/,48,1613806451.0,"Alright guys, just got off a group meeting that included John Fithian, President of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO, lol). They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**

**1) What did NATO do?**

\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.

\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. 

\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.

\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   


**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  
\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.

\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  


**3) Consolidation:**

\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   


4**) Pent-up Demand:**

\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   


**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**

It's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  
I'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. 

Normally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  
Godzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   


**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**

\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. 

\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. 

\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. 

\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  


**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**

\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. 

\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   
Netflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. 

\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  


**TL;DR** \- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed ""non-essential,"" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.   


Not financial advice, but I see some rockets and moons.

Not gonna leave Robinhood!!,0,lntcfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lntcfr/not_gonna_leave_robinhood/,14,1613805842.0,"Nope. 

Background: I have more brokerage accounts than I should. I use RH only to test retarded high risk/reward trades.

**My reasons for leaving**    
1. After the hearings, it's clear to me that RH has nothing more to offer to its clients. It will side with their handlers. *""If you don't pay for it, you are the product""*.    
2. Selectively blocking trades is not right on my playbook, whether it was the clearinghouse or whether they get punished for it or not. Their action on selected stocks successfully broke their momentum. Not fking nice.   
3. If their excuses are true, they were undercapitalized. Who wants to be with the losers?    
4. The automated selling of expiring options 1 hr before market close is not acceptable. I want to play my FDs until the bitter end. Huge swings happen at the last minute. Why trade with a brokerage that controls you?    
5. The app is so addictive and the easiest to use of them all, but you get the least information possible as you finalize your order. I found myself placing stupid bets right after making money on the ones that I carefully planned the day before when I was not influenced by the app. Some executives at Facebook and other social networks don't use their own products because they know they are designed to be addictive. You can't help it.       
6. This is an external factor, but a guy died because of conflicting information from the app, a margin call that should not have been sent, and the inability to reach customer service on time. Not cool.


**My reasons for not leaving**    
1. As a reminder that we have power as traders.   

This is not financial advice and you can do whatever you want with your money. I don't care if others keep using RH, but I'm bringing this up for discussion because it has material impact in how we trade, it influences the markets and our ability to do better for ourselves. That I care about.

So here is my final residual balance: $4.20

McAfee: Rising Superstar in the all important Device-to-Cloud Cybersecurity Sector,0,lnta7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnta7a/mcafee_rising_superstar_in_the_all_important/,18,1613805670.0,"With cloud computing becoming more relevant than ever, the need for high level cybersecurity has reached its peak. In comes McAfee:

McAfee Corp is the device-to-cloud cybersecurity company. It is engaged in protecting consumers, enterprises, and governments from cyberattacks with integrated security, privacy, and trust solutions. The company's Personal Protection Service provides holistic digital protection for an individual or family at home, on the go, and on the web. Its platform includes device security, privacy and safe Wi-Fi, online protection, and identity protection, creating a seamless and integrated digital moat. For enterprises and governments, it offers a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that protects its customers against adversarial threats across cloud, on-premise, hybrid environments and endpoint devices. It operates in two business segments namely Consumer and Enterprise. 

McAfee (MCFE) IPO'd quietly towards the end of 2020 and was lost in the hype of PLTR and many other public companies. However, with earnings approaching us next week after the United States markets close on Tuesday, February 23, it is important that we re-evaluate this stock and its current price.

Current Price: $19.47 at an 8 billion dollar market cap

EOY Price: $40

In the realm of cybersecurity, 2020 was all about cloud-based cybersecurity software names. Organizations were forced to migrate to cloud computing-based operations like never before, so there was huge demand for services from companies like Crowdstrike Holdings, Zscaler, and Octa, and prices for all three stocks increased by triple digit-percentages last year as a result. ¬†McAfee is also a force to be reckoned with in the enterprise security market, where it counts 78% of the Fortune 500¬† and 86% of the Global 2000 as customers. The company‚Äôs Mvision enterprise product portfolio¬†provides tools for protecting employee devices from hacking attempts. It also includes a growing lineup of solutions¬†for securing backend assets such as public cloud deployments and workloads deployed in containers. 

McAfee is expected to post 2.81 Billion dollars in revenue for the 2020 year, and earn a positive net income for the first time. I believe McAfee will be a dominate player in the cybersecurity industry for the years to come.

I've been pretty quite the last few weeks and I have a reason why.  


First to answer some well asked questions.

I only played shares.   
I rolled several of my shares on peaks from Dec-Jan  
Yes I made $4million and I'm still holding a lot of shares  


Now to what I really wanted to state to new WSB members and old members like myself.  


!!!A word of caution!!!  
Several people, people pretending to be normal WSB members and then after a few reddit messages informing me they have been in finance for 25 years (going as far as creating new accounts to try and talk to me) Others who have been trying to identify me on Reddit, and asking for me to either email them or call them, and even meet up. Dont engage these people

MY message to these people. Do you think I'm stupid? Anonymity is my friend at this point. We all have seen what happens to users like DFV once you get a name and a face.  Stop trying to threaten people or identify then for money.


Yes I made money. Deal with it. No need to try and scare and threaten someone on the internet.
No one in my life other than my wife knows about the money anyway.


Stay safe kids, the internet is a big place. Don‚Äôt give out too much details about yourself. Remember, people can have the ability to see your post history on other subreddits if you dont disable it.

Finally:
BRO, I just like the stock

I'M STILL HOLDING, and ITM.‚úãüíéüíéüíéü§ö   my opinion is that GME is a üöÄ waiting to lift off again.



Edit: I went quiet a few weeks ago because of some of the crazy shit people said to me. You name it, it was said. Scams, help me, i‚Äôll find you and kill you. I‚Äôve never had that attention before. Plus with the DFV legal issues. Yes I also updated my messages so it doesn‚Äôt happen again.

I've been following **UWMC** since the big GHIV merger a few weeks back, ever since, their share price has been on a steep decline. I think today may be the beginning of a reversal, with all of the call activity expiring. I just wanted to throw out some pros and cons out there to see if anyone can critique the after hour position I started today:

**Statistics** based on today's price:

Market Cap: 13.09B (analyst est. of 16.6B during merger)

Float: 100M, which represents about 6-7% of the total outstanding

Institutional Ownership: 16M shares at average of $9.06

P/E = 3.85               Forward P/E = 6.11

Net income = 3.38 B, a 715% increase y/y

Dividend = $.40, about 5% compared to today's prices

&#x200B;

**Pros:**

* Incredible value of P/E=3.85 compared to national avg of 12.8
* Forward P/E of 6.11 compared to that of RKT's at 10.5
* Book/Sh tangible liquidation value of 7.75/sh, which is a stone's throw away from the current prices
* 15 day mortgage closing compared to avg of 30-45 national avg; great tech
* Dividend coming up on Mar 8th
* Short interest of around 35-45% over the past few days
* Only 60,000 shares left to short according to IBKR
* Highest call vs put volume I've ever seen, lots of gamma ramps going up every strike

&#x200B;

**Cons:**

* Low float may be manipulated by MM's
* MM's are possibly short gamma from GHIV contracts, pushing prices down, and possibly scooping up shares before ex-div date
* Mortgage industry insecurity as promise of near 0 fed rate extending until end of 2022
* Mortgage companies not sexy
* Spac life cycle
* Insiders may sell in 6 months time, however, the CEO owns 90% of the company and has been adamant the company will prove itself to be worth analyst's valuation of at least $14.50

Garena: Sea's video platform is a place to distribute both internally developed games and third-party titles.

Shopee: The largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. Shopee was Indonesia‚Äôs largest e-commerce platform, with 310 million orders in the third quarter. Shopee ranked No. 1 in the stopping category in the country for average monthly active users, downloads and total time spent. Shopee had a daily average of 3.4 million orders in the third quarter.

SeaMoney: A digital payment solution to purchase stuff both on and off Shopee's platform
They recently acquired Bank BKE in December (and acquired a digital banking license) and will incorporate the banking nature across their entire platform, focusing and expanding on the digital banking and supplementing the ecommerce aspects.

Now let's talk financials you dumb wendy's slinging üê±:

**Income Statement**
$SE has doubled down in S&M expenses to expand and handle the massive growth they've seen in FY2020. Growing the category by 95% and 87%(YoY) in the past two quarters and I expect to see an increase in Q4 as well to accommodate the rocket increase in revenue.
As mentioned COVID has caused revenue to dramatically increase +100% in Q2 & Q3 2020 (YoY) and this will continue. Q4 2019 showed massive growth without COVID and with it still being a factor revenue will continue to climb well past their their record Q3 2020 1.22B.

**Balance Sheet:**
This company is flushed with cash, 3B üí∞ . Their debt is incredibly attractive as its mostly convertibles. If you don't get it google it Bitch!

**Stocks:**
$SE has broken through their main resistance lines of 237 and 276 this month and are currently in a wedge while the market tries to determine where the stock will head. This is the perfect opportunity to get in before it races up (or down ). I fully expect the major analysts to upgrade their price targets to ~300, like JP has done. Also their CEO (Forrest Li) holds large portion of the stock, which is always a great sign in a company. And did I mention Tencent holds 22% and is a gaming partner. They also ended on a LARGE green candle üïØ. They will run it on Monday. 

Summary
Their earnings report will be on 3/2 with analysts expecting a very positive outlook on Q4/FY2020 report. It's currently flagged as overvalued but so was Tesla and Amazon when they were at this price. $SE is considered the Amazon of southeast asia due to their expansion in ecommerce, fintech, and gaming. The big next step is - can they get EBITDA positive? They've already turned around their operating cash flow so...

**TLDR:** $SE is in a wedge touching resistance lines of ~282. If broken there is a lot of green space to run up past 300. Depending on the earnings call it could üöÄü§ëüíπ .I'm a massive bull on this stock so I'm in:

C: 282.5 

285/290 (if you want full retard).

For example, there are more BB articles on ""reddit's"" involvement in silver and AAL in the last month than posts I've actually seen on this sub ever. 

Today, I noticed an article on WSB's mods creating a youtube video [manifesto](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-19/wallstreetbets-video-says-it-s-time-to-level-the-playing-field) about ""leveling the playing field"" with Wall St. I can't find any posts on here linking the video. I spot checked a couple of the users listed in the credits and seems like this may have been made by the wave of planted mods trying to sabotage positive GME discussion.

While the video is generally positive on WSB and GME, it struck me as being very strange or out of place. Almost like no one here would've made it. Seems to me there's a concerted effort to hijack WSB's narrative by major media outlets now.

You might remember me from such hits as knowing exactly where each GME weekly was going to end up, getting people out of SNDL before it collapsed, and starting a $RIOT before it was cool, warning you to get out of PLTR at 39, amongst others.  Today I want to have a more...gentle...conversation with you.  Let's talk about cruise stonks.

&#x200B;

# Wayne's World Flashback Humming

Picture it:  It's 2020.  The air is crisp with winter in the air, you're blowing your student loans on the latest iPhone, and your parents have decided to spend some of your inheritance on a 10 day Caribbean cruise because they're tired of shoveling snow, and you ended up being their greatest disappointment, anyways so why should they leave you some money?  So you could go blow it all on some SPY FD puts?  Screw that.  Carnival ($CCL) was sitting at about $42 a share, $NCLH was at $52, $RCL at $115.  Everything in the world was in its place.

&#x200B;

Then mom and dad called you frantically to let you know that there was a bioattack upon the ship, originating somewhere around the shuffleboard area.  Everybody was dying and the army wasn't letting them off the ship.  They wanted to let you know that they loved you...but that they, too, had been buying SPY FD puts and had lost the rest of your inheritance and were waiting for the right time to tell you.  Things were looking really grim.

&#x200B;

As we all know, predictably, when the world shut down, the cruise stonks got positively crushed.  Turns out having $0 in revenue is bad for stonk price.  Who knew?  But should they stay there?  Is there no longer a business model for beyond-middle-aged white people that want to spend a couple of weeks pretending they're ""alive"" as they partake in an entirely on-the-rails kiddie bumper adventure?

&#x200B;

# Back to the present

Advance bookings say otherwise as Boomers make a recreational bet on ""return to normal"".  Take Norwegian, for example:  They're advance bookings for 2021 is actually \*ahead of\* where they were in 2019 in spite of extending their global sailing boycott all the way to \*\*next May\*\*.  Royal Caribbean and Carnival both state that their 2021 bookings are back to exactly on par where they were before all this madness about spicy flu happened.  And these are just the people who are willing to fork over money right now that AREN'T afraid of the scamdem...oops, I mean...well...you know.  Just wait until everybody gets emboldened by their plot armo...I mean vaccinations.  More tellingly, the vast majority of people who were booked on canceled cruises, when given the choice between refunds or rollovers, chose rollovers.  Dumb move since money now is better than money later, but just another sign that we're all in a virtual simulation of Idiocracy.  Run with it.  Now add in the fact that, as we open up, people will be positively DESPERATE to go do something - ANYTHING - that's not in their house that they will positively crush any and all entertainment options - especially travel.  So, in a way, this DD could actually apply to stonks like Cedar & Six Flags or Disney or...whoever sells ""fun"", depending on what your definition of that is.  Thanks to the K-shaped recovery, most people in this country are sitting on a pile of extra cash they're just waiting to blow on an enhanced vacation package of some sort.

&#x200B;

But let's look under the hood for a moment, shall we?  The reason these 3 lines were able to stave off bankruptcy is threefold:  1, they all raised debt to create liquidity. That's generally bad, but since the Fed has been a free money printing machine for a while, they got some fantastic interest rates for that debt.  Matter of fact, 2 of the 3 of them used that new debt to pay off older, higher interest debt, then took out new new debt to make up the difference.  2, they all issued shares and created a small amount of dilution (though, in the case of Carnival, they were in the middle of a stock buyback when this all happened, so they basically ended up re-issuing the shares they had bought.  Bad for short term balance sheets, but long term lesser impact), and 3, they've been locked out of COVID related relief packages till now, which means their turn in the queue is widely viewed as coming up for their shot at free money roulette.  At present, it's looking like about a quarter billion dollars to them to bail them out.  They've already been able to shift their portage losses directly to the ports in question, so they saved some cash there, as well.

&#x200B;

So, using some napkin math and Yamazaki logic, the only thing preventing these cruise lines from going right back to where they were before all this happened is if they find themselves in a credit crunch, as the data shows that they will return to normal capacity operations in time.  So let's take a look at cash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Cash on hand for stonks](https://preview.redd.it/qije4vzf9ii61.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a7e7ffcc159e13c3971582f68aaef1147140f0)

&#x200B;

In the chart above, I took the liberty of adding $CUK, which is Carnival's ""other"" stonk.  Really, understanding this group, I guess I should have listed that one as the primary so you feel more comfortable about it as you listen to your wife get railed by her boyfriend.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

OK, so how much are they burning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Moneys](https://preview.redd.it/tn4v6mfc9ii61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f48de1c580e73a8819c42a2ac98473967f98547)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah, all you know exactly what this looks like - nobody knows better than WSB how to look at loss porn, and these cruise lines have a lot of it.  The gist here is that Carnival and Norwegian are probably fine financially for at least another year with no new income (and they have debt they haven't accessed yet at their disposal).  Royal Caribbean is in a little bit of a tighter spot, as they're going to have to go to the banks for money in the next 6 months barring a government bailout.  Norwegian is in a particularly envious position, because their debt levels are already lower than everybody else's and some of their smaller subsidiaries are going to be setting sail on those river cruises earlier, which will staunch their bleeding as Europe re-opens.

&#x200B;

Now, because I know all you retards love talking about shorts and what not, let's take a look at what Wall Street thinks of these stonks.  If they're going bankrupt, they're going to lean their chipstack in on them, right?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They don't seem to be betting on them to fail.  Hmm.

Let's take a look at volume

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The smart money started piling in just before Christmas.  That's about when I got in on 2 of these, as well.  But I felt it was an aggressive move at the time.  Especially since we were missing a lot of vaccination data as well as any forward guidance from these companies.  They've since clarified their stance, and the vaccination data shows that we were already going to be rolling out a million doses a day, in spite of what one side of the aisle was claiming the mango was going to deliver on.  Volume tapered off to normal levels since then, but has since started picking up on the upbeat news that should have effect on this particular industry.

&#x200B;

Outlook:  I'm incredibly bullish on $NCLH.  I'm highly bullish on $CCL.  $RCL is a little more problematic to me, looking at the total picture, and I'm pretty neutral on them overall, bordering on skeptical.

I had more I wanted to talk about, but I'm tired of typing.

&#x200B;

# So, To summarize:

&#x200B;

* Your Boomer parents are going to start getting on these boats again as soon as they start floating
* Unlike last time (and thanks to the K-shaped recovery), they'll very likely splurge on the shore activity packages rather than cheap out and sit by the pool at every port this time since they have extra money to burn
* None of these companies are facing imminent financial threat, and have not only secured solid credit lines and nice reserves to weather this storm without sinking  (get it?  Hah), but actually showed their financial houses were pretty tight
* They've always been reliable earners, and will continue to be as they ramp back up.  This is a rare opportunity to get what is usually a slow moving Boomer stonk at a steep discount
* In the future, they'll actually be able to make MORE money because they had COVID as an excuse to suspend dividends, and don't think for a second they're going to be in a rush to bring those back even after shit returns to normal
* Your grandparents still don't love you either
* Buy a cruise ticket and you'll be sad, but you'll have enough money to where you'll be able to find some 45 year old who's a bit on the brown side of ripe that mistakenly thought they were going to be Stella and get their groove back with some strapping Jamaican native, who nonetheless will be impressed by your stack of tendies and will probably still give you blowies as you try to reach down to get to the base of her sagging tiddies
* Also invest in some pharma plays for the inevitable increase in senior citizen STD's that's going to occur when they can leave the nursing homes again.  Your widowed grandparents are going to bang at least 6 complete strangers on lobster night because they heard it was an aphrodisiac.

# Price targets:

$NCLH:  Probably $46 by 2022.  $60 by 2023

$CCL and $CUK:  $35 by 2022.  $47 by 2023.  For $CUK subtract 5 bucks

$RCL:  $90 by 2022.  $96 by 2023

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?

Well, retard, one thing you definitely don't do is play short term FD's on this.  Sorry, I know how much you love them, but have you considered shorting $RIOT if you hate money?  You'll get the same effect, but you can at least say you lost money on digital fake money, which will make you rare.  The answer here is OTM leaps.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  If you ain't got cruise stonks, you ain't black

# Position disclaimers:

&#x200B;

$CCL:  700 1/22 $25c's.  I'll likely expand this position to 1000 options

$NCLH:  2000 1/23 $42.5c's.  I'll very likely add another 3000 2023 calls if there's some terrible news that causes a precipitous drop

Getting turned $ON (Semiconductor play update),48,lnpq0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnpq0g/getting_turned_on_semiconductor_play_update/,20,1613795437.0,"[Update](https://i.imgur.com/gG9rg1n.png?2)

Its been about a week since the announcement of some form of an as yet undisclosed subsidy program for US semiconductors.

[My previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcqm/im_on_for_on/)

I remain very bullish on the prospects of $ON. Not only do I think the growing semiconductor shortage is a super beneficial circumstance for $ON, given their ability to make many of the semiconductors required for [automotive and industrial computers/robots/appliances](https://www.onsemi.com/products). I also think they sit in an incredibly good position to receive a brunt of whatever the Biden admin is preparing to announce in support of the industry due to their large holding in the US. Further, I think they sit in a great space in the recent Texas weather debacle because [*they don't own any fabs in Texas,* something many other US semi's can't say.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants#Open_plants) 

[Weekly Chart](https://i.imgur.com/vSknBaG.png?1)

So far their weekly chart has been a very easy hold. The one dip its taken so far has disappeared quicker than it arrived, and I think only happened due to knock on market forces from the S&P value loss from the Texas disaster. 

However, I think there is something crucially undervalued already in $ON. Its options gamma. 

[Option Volatility](https://i.imgur.com/mz5ESeV.png)

The stock has a historically low IV at the moment, effectively suppressing the cost of its calls and puts. It sits currently at just 47 on its 30 day implied volatility with a 52 week range of 37-133. Thats very low for this stock. This seems crazy. The market for semiconductors is due to have one heck of a shift, up or down, which will raise all option's gammas, if the Biden admins announced support are anything to be believed.

In summary, I like this stock *a lot*. I think it has the potential to take a big leg up if the subsidy program breaks its way, and even if it doesn't, $ON will benefit from being pulled up by the growing interest in the semiconductor market. But the kicker, is even if the Biden program falls flat, any action in the sector will almost certainly see a volatility spike in the semiconductor industry stocks which will let our gamma value increase. This stock is in the perfect position to break out in my opinion even with a rare IV spread potential.",2021-02-20 06:30:37

Vlad's testimony about the 5.11am phone call.,1293,lnof20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnof20/vlads_testimony_about_the_511am_phone_call/,181,1613792089.0,"Vlad Tenev testified to the members of Congress at the hearing that he received the phone call at 5.11am.   I  think the lawmakers or most others haven't realised, Vlad is in Australia.  It sounds innocent, as it was 5am time that the shares hit 570 in the early early hours of pre-market on the morning of 28th of January. 


Sydney NSW, Australia is 16 hours ahead of New York. So if it was 5.11am he got the call, that puts it maybe midday on the 27th of January in New York time. 17 hours before the pre-market height of 570 came on the 28th of January (US Eastern Timezone), after which minutes later, he pulled the plug.

Same time as this phone call, he did a video interview on CNBC, saying Retail Investing is the new home ownership.  (At this time, I don't know if he already had received the call, or after)  Becky on CNBC thanked him at the end of that interview for being awake so late in the night/early in the morning and referenced he was in Australia, and Vlad acknowledged what time it was exactly.   

But what is definite - everyone that bought shares after Midday on the 27th of January, and for the following 17 hours, Vlad knew those investors were screwed because of that 5.11am call on Australian time.

**Edit:** Maybe someone can find what time exactly Vlad made that live interview on the CNBC show on the 27th, to figure out if he had already gotten the 5.11am call.

I know that in the 27th of January Live GME thread here on WSB when Vlad's interview started, some posters mentioned it in the comments.

I Don't Like This Stock: Bumble,72,lno21v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lno21v/i_dont_like_this_stock_bumble/,90,1613791179.0,"Bumble $BMBL recently IPOed.  It's currently sitting at 70 USD.  I think it is wildly overvalued.

&#x200B;

**Bumble IPOed in the post Online Dating World**

Online dating peaked several years ago.  Since then Match Group has pretty much taken control of all the other major Apps.  Tinder turned into a shit show, and then Bumble was created out of the belief that Tinder could be done better.  

In the meantime everyone and their mother has weighed in on Online Dating, it's rise, decline and the Class Action against Match.  Online Dating is considered awful, and many have taken note of the microtransactions that fund these companies.  

So we know market is oversaturated with Dating Apps.  There are tons of them.  We know people don't have a great opinion of these Apps, in fact you can find a lot of negative opinions on Reddit.  So why did it have such a robust IPO?

**Bumble Is Living In The Pandemic Bubble**

I'm of the opinion there are several companies and services right now experiencing a boom that could only happen because of the lockdowns and social distancing.  Your food delivery services, streaming services, and you guessed it Bumble, all benefit from the current conditions.  Once people are free to get back out into the world that bubble is going to pop.  

**The counter argument is that once we get back to normal everyone can start seeing each other from Bumble so things will really take off.  But this is flawed.**

Right now people are using Bumble, not meeting up, ghosting, having conversations that fizzle out.  So there will be a number of people frustrated with online dating, people leaving Bumble because they prefer real life interactions.  Bumble is running through clients who really don't have the ability to interact safely or enjoyably during this time.  They are building up burnout.

That burnout will lead to people abandoning the App.  Either in the form of dissatisfaction or excitement at being able to go back out into public.  During the lockdown they will have been conditioned to think of Bumble as a fun distraction, but not an actual tool to meeting people since they haven't been getting out.

**How Does Bumble Make Money?**

They sell things to enhance ""the experience"" of Bumble.  Basically seeing who likes you, being seen by more people, the occasional AD too.  This is dependent on one thing.  People willing to pay and be on the App.  If people don't pay for the extra transactions because they are frustrated, don't think they need them, or think it's a scam, Bumble won't make money.  If people make an exodus from Bumble because a better, ""free"" App comes along, or people burnout, then companies won't want to pay for AD space.

**Match Is Ahead Of Bumble**

Match does something Bumble doesn't.  They schedule live events for people to meet up as a group.  That means they are partnering with businesses and getting them revenue.  For Match this means they backstop their App from burnout by being able to get people face to face.  Match also operates like a gym.  You sign up, pay a fee that renews and then you forget about it.  Bumble makes you consciously choose to pay for crap.  Match offers their microtransactions as a side from the main money maker, subscriptions.  Match ties the subscriptions to being able to message and see messages.  That's more of a draw than just seeing likes on an App that doesn't let you message first.

**Is Bumble A 20 Dollars Stock?**

What does it have to offer beyond what it is in a saturated market?  What is the big new thing they are doing to justify being at 70 to 40 bucks?  What are it's plans to navigate a posit COVID world?  I haven't seen these answered.  I still can't understand why it's a public company other than to fund itself with the IPO.  I just don't see the long term draw that makes this an investment you want to hold.",2021-02-20 05:19:39

FUNDAMENTALS:

Crushed Q4 estimates. Revenue $601M beat by $122M!!! REAL ESTATE IS BACK BABY.

Leasing  still very weak given uncertainty around COVID. But those leases HAVE  to get turned over eventually. As long as people get vaxxed, the  commercial real estate party is just getting started.

NASDAQ  shares. Management is dropping a $400 MILLION REPURCHASE PROGRAM. Look  at the market cap, look at the $400 million. HUGE HUGE HUGE.

If  we expect activity to pick up during the summer, which it very well may  from pent up demand, 2021 EPS could surge to $2.0. I think fair value  is $15-$30 depending how bullish you are on real estate.

Why MRO is Extremely Undervalued,25,lnndoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnndoa/why_mro_is_extremely_undervalued/,24,1613789495.0,"Why MRO is extremely undervalued:

First, MRO's market cap is $6.02 billion, but its net assets are $10.89 billion. This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. 

For one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020.

Once they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. 

People will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. 

Furthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops.

Personal experience with the SoFi and why I'm Bullish,27,lnnb34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnnb34/personal_experience_with_the_sofi_and_why_im/,22,1613789320.0,"I wanted to share my personal experience with SoFi and why it makes me bullish on the stock. I bought a house in 2017-2018 when interest rates were high around 5%. With the recent low interest rates I started looking around. At the same time I was also looking to consolidate and refinance two private student loans. This was November of last year (2020) 

SoFi reeled me with the student loan refinance first. The whole process took literally a few steps to complete. I never had to call up anyone or provide additional information beyond the basic stuff required. I was able to consolidate (2) loans from Firstmark to SoFi within basically a week.. 

Wow, so now I'm impressed by how easy the experience was with the student loan refinance and at the same time I'm dealing with a refinance process through PNC bank (who held the original loan) and they are giving me a hard ass time. I mean it was months of back and forth to the point where I stopped the process at the final disclosure and moved the process over to SoFi half out of spite to the PNC people I was dealing with. Now I wont say refinancing a home is easy, but the people at SoFi were professional and helped get it done as fast as they could. 

So great, I now have my student loans and my home loan through SoFi. Next, I get an email that invites me to sign up for a credit card with 2% cash back that can be applied directly to the student loan or redeemed for stocks. I think how great this is and sign up, get my card in a week and start using it to get points/money towards my student loan. Also at this point, I set up a trading account because I was playing around with the credit card redemption options. The trading platform needs work, but I like where it‚Äôs headed. The redemption for stock and stock slices are two items I cannot do with my TD account and will enjoy using. 

So from November 2020 to February 2021, I completed/opened (2) Loans, (1) credit card, and (1) trading account.. All of this and I had not been aware that SoFi was going public through a SPAC until after I had completed all of the things mentioned above so I was curious to look into it once I found out about it. I read the investor slides and quickly realized that 1) I fit their target demographic and 2) I completely demonstrated (to myself) exactly how they plan to get people in and then get them to use additional products within their ecosystem once they are. I completely see this platform as a potential for enormous growth over the next few years because SoFi sucks you in and sells you on multiple product offerings so quickly and easily. The best part is that you‚Äôll love the one app on your phone for everything. I have like 8 banking apps right now and I cannot wait to consolidate over the next few years into one product.

Anyway, that is my .02 and why I'm bullish on the stock 225shares avg@22.87. Numerous Calls for March/April. Thoughts? Anyone else have a good or bad experience with SoFi?",2021-02-20 04:48:40

The Real Reason Why RH is Hated,119,lnmoxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnmoxr/the_real_reason_why_rh_is_hated/,49,1613787747.0,"When we first learned about RH restricting trading on GME, we all saw through any generic PR marketing statements and felt as if we knew exactly what was going on: RH was trying to cover their buddies at Melvin and Citadel and let them catch up to their shorts. However, even though I still believe RH's close partnership with Citadel did have an influence on their decision to outright ban buying of the stock (but not selling), we DO need to focus on the real problem here, which isn't necessarily Robinhood.

&#x200B;

Vlad's first interview was on CNBC on the day of the restrictions (link in comments) . Vlad went on CNBC and originally claimed that the decision to limit buying on the securities was a ""difficult decision"" and it was to ""protect the firm and protect our customers"".

&#x200B;

Later, Vlad came on CNN to again reaffirm that the problems at Robinhood were not liquidity issues. (link in comments)

&#x200B;

From further statements and his Congressional testimony, we now know more about the details about what happened on the 28th. Vlad received a phone call from the DTCC at 4 AM asking him to raise the collateral necessary from Robinhood by tenfold (a number of about $3,000,000,000 total). Understandably so, a company like Robinhood which, according to estimates, is only worth about $10 billion itself does not have $3 billion lying around to post as collateral. This, although almost a textbook definition of a liquidity problem, is denied to be a liquidity problem by Vlad. I believe Vlad specifically uses the phrase ""Robinhood does not have a liquidity problem"" because he was EVENTUALLY able to raise the capital necessary to continue operations within the next few days (albeit at the expense of the consumer whose longs were already able to be covered by shorts in that time period).

&#x200B;

If Vlad actually gave any sort of shit about the everyday investor, he would be using his platform to criticize the DTCC requirements, especially after such short notice (a 4AM phone call when the stock spiked). The DTCC raising collateral requirements by tenfold during the entire saga is unprecedented, and frankly ridiculous considering how much money the DTCC processes on a weekly basis.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Vlad Tenev is a puppet and can't act on behalf of his ""client base"" to criticize the parties that should actually be held responsible for what happened on the 28th, so any backlash Robinhood gets is still well deserved. We need answers on how the DTCC can arbitrarily increase collateral requirements by tenfold within the timespan of less than 24 hours.",2021-02-20 04:22:27

Since there‚Äôs no running water people are not aware that their pipes are burst. As soon as Texas gets its emergen-C and warms up millions of people are going to realize they need home repair for their copper pipes.

Pricing Inefficiency: CUK vs CCL,12,lnm9p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnm9p5/pricing_inefficiency_cuk_vs_ccl/,28,1613786625.0,"
Wanted to bring attention to the widened gap between the shares/ADR for Carnival Corp, $CCL and $CUK.

So Carnival has 2 different tickers. Carnival's business structure is unusual in that it incorporates two separate legal entities that nevertheless function as a single entity. $CCL is the common stock for Canival Corp, issued on and primarily trades on the NYSE. The other half of the company, Carnival PLC, primarily trades on the London Stock Exchange, though are additionally listed on NYSE under ticker $CUK. Both tickers are tied to the same entity and trade in tandem, but not always perfectly. For all intents and purposes, they‚Äôre the same shares. The only real benefit to holding $CCL over $CUK is liquidity. $CCL is without a doubt more liquid and sees higher volume each day, no disputing it. 

But the dividend is the same, the voting rights are the same, the shares rise and fall like they‚Äôre holding hands on a swing set. The spread between them is typically negligible. ~$1-$2 is a fairly normal spread being the same shares with the same voting rights, same dividend payouts, same effect during the bankruptcy that people keep saying is going to happen because they‚Äôve never been on a cruise and hate them as a result and believe the entire $38 billion industry is going to fail and liquidate tomorrow.

As of this writing, $CCL is $24.40 and $CUK is trading at $20.44. A $4 wide spread. As the industry recovers, and both stocks rise, this will inevitably narrow. This is not financial advice, do your own research, BUT to me, this appears to be free money if you are bullish on Carnival/Cruising returning as we continue to roll out vaccines to boomers. Buying CUK over CCL represents a 16% upside as the spread narrows seeing as they both carry the same intrinsic value.

SENS is the latest one to be surging on approval news.  They have approval for their 90-day implantable CGM, and should get approval for the 180 day soon and maybe the 365 next year.

Over 2-3 years this is likely gonna run to $40-$50 just on hype.  People are playing this like it‚Äôs the next TNDM or DXCM. Until then it‚Äôs playing a fun game of double or triple and then give up half the gains. 

I think we retrace to $4 over the next week or two and anything $4 or below is a buy before we continue on our path to $10 by summer.  Once we hit $10 I think we trade sideways till the approval news. If it‚Äôs approved have fun going to $40 over the next two years, and if not, we may be back near $2-$5 very fast.  

It‚Äôs been spiking ever since an insurance company decided to start covering their product.  Their implant device is less expensive by far than the dexcom and Medtronic on top of the skin versions.  So insurance companies are motivated to cover it.  However, adoption could be iffy until the longer lasting ones are approved l, because who wants to get it switched out every few months?  

The addressable market is huge and growing, valuation of diabetes tech plays are surging for anyone who can become a viable competitor and take another bite out of the dinosaur Medtronic‚Äôs market share.  

If they get denied approval this will sell off hard just like any small cap pharma play. It‚Äôs a binary option 

I‚Äôve been playing it with call spreads since it was at 60 cents in December. With how fast it‚Äôs risen I honestly would have been better off just buying shares. 

Still holding July $1-$2 call spreads I bought back in December. Plan to keep holding. May add either shares or calls if we get below $4 in the next week or so.

APPH (AppHarvest) is bringing that technology to the US to the cheap lands of Kentucky. If you view any of their videos, you can see how much they are doing for the community in Kentucky.  I can't post youtube links here, but just go to youtube and look at the presentation they did at a local high school.  The CEO, Jonathan Webb, is from Kentucky and really wants to give back and help develop the area.  He went to UK for undergrad.

Indoor farming reduces water uses by a whopping 90% over traditional farming, according to their website: [https://www.appharvest.com/](https://www.appharvest.com/)

Global warming is happening guys. Fresh water is decreasing. People talk rare earth minerals being depleted, but fresh water is one that's decreasing that everyone is afraid to talk about, but everyone needs. AppHarvet's technology could potential be used to maybe grow crops even in the dessert of Sahara! Not to mention, with the likelyhood of Federal legalization of marijuana in the next few years, indoor farming tech will continue to boom.

**The benefits of indoor farming include:**

* **90% less water use than traditional farming**
* **Less use of chemicals/ pesticides as you don't have to worry about locust plagues and other bugs**
* **More crops per acreage due to ability to grow crops on top of each other.**

\-------

APPH has a small market cap of $4B right now.  For such an innovative company, that really does seem cheap.    I currently can't think of a AMazon or Tesla or Apple of the Aggtech world.  This IMO is a no brainer investment as society is moving towards a greener future.  No matter who you talk to or what business leader/politican you listen too, everyone is looking for ways to make things sustainable.

I'm such a believer in APPH, Aggtech,, indoor farming, and green technology that if I had any background in agriculture, I would see if I could work for such a company.  Indoor farming is the future guys!

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday suspended trading in more securities that have seen jumps in both prices and trading volumes since late January amid social media interest.

The SEC temporarily suspended trading of Marathon Group Corp PDPR.PK, Affinity Beverage Group Inc ABVG.PK, and Sylios Corp UNGS.PK beginning on Friday and ending on March 4, the SEC said in statements published on its website.

**The suspensions are the latest effort by the SEC to address soaring retail investor interest driven by conversation on social media platforms**, most notably seen in a surge and subsequent plunge in share prices of GameStop Corp GME.N. Last week, the regulator suspended trading in a defunct stock.

**Volatile trading in so-called ""meme stocks,""** assets which draw sudden interest from retail investors amid discussion on social media platforms, **has left both hedge funds and retail investors nursing steep losses in recent weeks.** The market tumult has drawn the scrutiny of federal and state regulators as well as U.S. lawmakers, who on Thursday grilled executives from online broker Robinhood, market maker Citadel Securities and hedge funds.

In each of three separate statements detailing Friday's trading suspensions, **the SEC said ""certain social media accounts may be engaged in a coordinated attempt to artificially influence"" share prices.**

The SEC has been looking at the actions of any and all participants involved in the recent trading. Potential misconduct the SEC is probing, according to its acting chair, includes: market manipulation; whether retail brokers breached fair access rules by restricting buying; the role of hedge funds with short positions in the companies, including whether there was enough data and transparency around their bets; and whether the companies took advantage of the rally to raise funds.

All three securities suspended on Friday saw sudden increases in their share prices and volumes in the absence of any publicly available news, the regulator said. The SEC further cautioned brokers and other dealers to make sure they have complied with investor protection rules when trading resumes.",2021-02-20 03:05:11

When I stumbled across this stock I was instantly confused. They went from an all time high of $21 in 2014 to a current share price of $1.46. Over the last 6 months they have declined all the way from $8.74 to $1.45. So why is this stock getting beat up you‚Äôre probably asking? Well, it‚Äôs being priced for bankruptcy. They‚Äôre balance sheets aren‚Äôt looking great and they currently have $8,000,000,000 more in liabilities than assets which has been exacerbated by Covid-19. With a number like this it makes sense why the common investor would be bearish and stay shy. We‚Äôre different in this community and let me explain why I‚Äôm bullish. I did some research and found out that Rolls Royce makes most of its money from the number of hours it‚Äôs engines fly. I then found out that Rolls Royce is a national treasure of England‚Äôs, and England would try very hard to keep supporting them. I also learned that they have large contracts, some of them worth more than $1,000,000,000 alone. So you‚Äôre telling me the market cap is $10,000,000,000 and they have a third of that in 1 single contract? They operate in 50 countries and have customers in 150 more. They are the second largest competitor in the engine industry(behind general electric) but are priced for bankruptcy? They literally can not go bankrupt. Their balance sheets look scary but they are so well established and relied on all around the world. If the stock went up 2x or 3x it would still be less than half of what it was trading at pre covid. The opportunity is unreal. And for a little more hope if you weren‚Äôt already into it, they‚Äôre working on electric engines and space travel. Yep. 2 things we love here.

A good amount of the congressmen/women yesterday spouted out bullshit and an overwhelming amount talked about nonsense regulations instead of questioning the issues that occurred on Jan 24th - Jan 30th. I do agree that 90% of the interviews were hogwash and used for political posturing, but a few of them were utter all-stars and should be called out!

I have re-watched the hearing yesterday and sorted out the bullshit and provided a few below names of congress people that we should rally behind and their main talking points/questions during the hearing:

**Anthony ""5:11 AM Liquidity"" Gonzalez (OH) -**

RepAGonzalez

Interview starts at 3h43m

Anthony is the only person so far in the ENTIRE WORLD to have Vlad fess up that he did not have the liquidity to make the $3 Billion Clearing House fee at 5:11 AM. Vlad has utterly dodged this question from CNBC, Elon, etc. and Anthony is the first one to question this. Additionally, he brought out the point that RH was about to be liquefied by the DTCC and pulled the plug to cover their own asses rather than look out for their customers. Multiple times Anthony stated there is clearly a systemic problem here that needs to be corrected. I cannot praise this guy enough! He did his homework and asked AMAZING questions!

**Michael ‚ÄúWho Called In The Artillery‚Äù San Nicolas (Guam) -**

GuamCongressman

Interview starts at 3h 48m

Michael was like a damn artillery strike. Anthony was right before him as the infantry, then Michael came in pounding Vlad and team like 40mm cannons on Omaha Beach. Holy shit did this dude go off. Michael brought the fact that not only did RH fuck every one of their customers over, THEY PROTECTED THEMSELVES from larger losses! Paraphrasing: That $3 Billion capital that you had to raise would have been more if you didn‚Äôt halt trading on the stock! You protected yourselves from larger losses that the $3 billion that you had to raise.

**Juan ‚ÄúRobbinDaHood‚Äù Vargas (CA) -**

RepJuanVargas

Interview starts at 3h 8m

Called out Robin hood and the rest of the Hedge Funds that Robin Hood can no longer use that name because they are actually the inverse of Robin Hood and stealing from the poor. ‚ÄúGriffin, how many people are in the room with you right now?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt ask too many technical questions, but he did a great job at pinpointing that in reality Robin Hood‚Äôs true customers are the hedge funds and the users are merely products.

**Blaine Leutkemeyer (MO) -**

RepBlaine

Interview starts at 1h 39m

Now, this guy looks like a good ole boy and I was about to write him off...but he started to truly question manipulation of a stock price. Additionally, he further pushed in saying that if a stock is 140% over-leveraged clearly manipulation is occurring on the stock. He ran out of time, but this is clearly the guy we need to go with for getting deeper into manipulation of stocks questions and why the stock was over-leveraged so much in the first place!

**Al ‚ÄúCost of Doing Business‚Äù Green**

RepAlGreen

Interview starts at 1h 55m

Brought facts and figures showing that Melvin/Citadel has inquired millions of fines, but in reality those fines are far less than the money they are making on the shady deals they are performing. This is the representative that we support to increase the fines and regulation on these shady hedge funds.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Steve Stivers (OH) -**

RepSteveStivers

‚ÄúVlad, does the stock go up or down when you take out demand?‚Äù

Advocated for B l oc k c ha i n and that their schemes would not work in the B l oc k c ha i n environment. Griffin‚Äôs eyes were utterly terrified when Warren was speaking.

**Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY)**

AOC

She did great in the form of asking about naked shorting (before she got cut off), but was asking Vlad to essentially make his company free by giving money to his users via payments for order flow. This is not the answer, AOC is essentially trying to make a company free...which is not realistic. We know that RH is predatory, but this terrifies me if this is where she‚Äôs going. Correct me if I misunderstood please! Also, she appears to be checking her twitter for DD!

**Sean Casten (IL)**

Called RH to call out Vlad‚Äôs shitty customer service. This was great, but we all know RH has shitty customer service and we‚Äôre not here for that. Also, I almost felt like he was alluding to that if you are below 21 you should not be able to buy stocks‚Ä¶.

[shitty logo ](https://preview.redd.it/vxkuuscdegi61.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2b36d7a588e2afcaf8db7f115d25b24c8de91b8)

Name aside, this company does one thing well, it consistently makes MONEY. Flowers has beaten estimates on their last eight earnings to the tune of 15-24%

This isn‚Äôt a pump and dump that you‚Äôre going to make 60% in a week. But a 20% share price gain can still take you to tendy town with the right call options and a good batch of shares. The last week of crabbing share price has dropped the IV since the last earnings price spikes, making it a perfect opportunity to pick up some calls pre-Q3 fiscal results in April.

# üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ  The Bull Case   üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ

It‚Äôs no secret that the only reason this stock is trading sub $40 is that their growth hasn‚Äôt been drop dead sexy. It‚Äôs been consistently seasonal, but it hasn‚Äôt really blown the roof off the fucker‚Ä¶ until fiscal Q2. Industry analysts always expect Flowers to have a strong Q2 (September - December is their growth months); however, they never expected the company to post $1.72 EPS üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ . Flowers not only made more money overall, but they also managed to lower management costs and improve e-commerce growth (up 59.7% YOY). On some level, a portion of this could be due in part to COVID-19 driving consumers online. Local traditional florists were small businesses that have been shuttered by cancellations of large-scale events and local business restrictions. Many will not re-open, or can not compete with the FLWS model. The real question is will the average consumer return to purchasing at their local florist if they‚Äôre even open anymore, or just become a  customer. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Just before the earnings bomb was dropped the share price rose to a 52 week high, \~$37 on hype alone. Paper hands lit up and it dumped down to $28. The bull case would see the stock climb back to 40 over the next 2-3 months, and perhaps even touching $45 before Fiscal Q3 earnings are due in April, 2021. Wall Street expects a net loss of 9c/share. If Flowers can beat this and go positive, it would mark the first time the company made a profit per share in Q3. I would imagine this would signal a shift in the companies growth, and lead the stock to some sort of breakout. If their newest acquisitions can drive earnings in the off-season (Q1, Q3 and Q4) then expect a huge upside.

Further, Flowers has made some power purchases over the last two years to expand its eCommerce reach. Their most recent acquisitions include:

1. **üçì**  *Berries.com (Shari‚Äôs Berrys ‚Äì Purchased 08/19 for $20.5 million)*  **üçì**

a. This was a steal. Shari was about to start selling used panties online after her retail model resulted in multiple store closures. Flowers stepped in and scaled the business into a successful e-commerce business on berries.com. Now they‚Äôre dipping 9 million berries a year at \~$3.75/berry. I would imagine the margins are pretty big on these given how little a strawberry and some dipping chocolate costs.

2.  üí∞ *PersonalizationMall (Purchased 2/20 $252 million)* üí∞

A big player in the personalized gift space. Ranks above Etsy on an organic google search (which is nuts), and is going to expose Flowers to a new sector for growth. What‚Äôs especially important about this acquisition is that the site drives business year-round. Flowers has a VERY cyclical earnings cycle subject to huge swings based on seasonal revenue (the lion share of the companies earnings comes Thanksgiving through Christmas). This site will drive revenue in the dry fiscal quarters for the company (Q1, Q3 & Q4) üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

3 . üöÄ *The gay bears are betting against us*üöÄ

The stock has historically been shorted. As of 1/29/21 data, the stock is 20% of float short, down significantly since earnings. I wouldn‚Äôt call it squeezable, but there are some strong bets against the stock, most of which are looking pretty dumb right now. It would take \~ 4 days for them to cover based on estimates. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

4. üöÄ *The financials look good*üöÄ

https://preview.redd.it/uvjy8opeegi61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ada09b901fd6b270ff8100095b90d7e20f454d

30% asset growth in 2020, that's the exponential growth I'm getting on. Before that we were seeing sub 10% asset growth. If Flowers can keep this type of growth, I really like the stock even more. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ   üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ   üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

## [üåàüêª](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)The Bear Case  [üåàüêª](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)

Look, Flowers is a seasonal business. EPS is over a dollar in Fiscal Q2, and is often negative, or barely positive, in the remaining months. The gay bears betting against this stock believe that it‚Äôs possible Flowers doesn‚Äôt go net positive for the rest of fiscal 2021. The question on everyone's mind, is the stock actually making a positive growth trend? Or was this just a fluke based on COVID-19 closures?

If the gay bear theories prove true, the stock could sink. Flowers doesn‚Äôt report positive news very often, only on acquisitions and fiscal Q2 earnings. The rest of the year is basically hype. A few shitty news cycles and this stock could have a VERY negative sentiment. If Flowers doesn‚Äôt blow away Fiscal Q3, I wouldn‚Äôt expect much movement above $30-35. Still pretty safe to hold shares against gay bears, but calls won't print.

Also, ignore the title, just taking advantage of the flair, don't bow, I'm just a normal dude that loves mattress stocks.

I am writing this post because PRPL just scheduled their earnings call and the most significant part about this call is **that it is scheduled in the AM and it is a week earlier than projected. An AM call has only happened one other time in Purples history and it was when they beat on earnings and increased guidance from \~325M to \~400M.** I am extremely Bullish on how this call will be taken by the media because there will likely be a huge GAAP earnings (hopefully, I'm not an accountant) due to 4 quarters of warrant accruals reversing. Also, the mattress industry as a whole is doing well, look at TPX and SNBR, both beat and moved significantly after their earnings calls.

Please be conservative in your plays as I don't want people crying to me later, also do your own research, go try a bed or a cushion and understand why I like their products.

# What I am expecting

* A big GAAP earnings due to accrual reversal
* An Adjusted EBITDA beat, street is saying .11 cents, I am expecting 20-30 cents.
* Guidance for 2021, Street is saying 826M, I assume they will guide to 875M+ and deliver 925M+
* New product discussion- I am expecting they will talk about new premium products
* Partner expansion- if you haven't read my previous DD, please look. they are in about 1800 American stores and 300 Canadian stores. There are tons of expansion opportunities, even with just their existing partner Mattress firm.
* I am hoping they mention their expected capital investment- they are expected to nearly fill their second factory with 4-6 lines, based on previous calls.
* 2022 revenue potential- I expect they will end this year with 1.2-1.3B worth of capacity, it would be good to understand this on their guidance call so you can see the potential for the coming years.

# How to play the earnings call - I own debit spreads only but there are multiple ways.

* Super conservative, sell 30.00 and 35.00 purple puts for March
* Mildly conservative, sell 40.00 puts for March
* Aggressive, sell 45.00 and 50.00 puts for March
* Conservative, buy shares
* Mildly conservative, 20/30, 30/40 debit spreads.
* Aggressive, 35/45 40,45, 40/50 debit spreads - These are risky IMO
* Mildly conservative, buy LEAPS- though these are thinly traded.

Be careful out there. Also, options for out months are thinly traded so make sure you understand limit orders as you can get screwed by the bid ask.

Feel free to DM me with questions. I may add to my position after I free up some capital next week.

EV Basics for Non-Engineer Investors,24,lnic4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnic4d/ev_basics_for_nonengineer_investors/,23,1613776817.0,"Ok right off the bat do your own DD, I'm not saying to invest in any specific company here, just trying to list some basic parts and suppliers so that others have a better starting point for their own DD with the large number of new EV players. About 80% of the parts are the same across an EV or traditional (aka non-hybrid) ICE vehicle. We know the big hedgies employ engineers or engineering research firms, so why shouldn't we get some of the same background. This is about the other 20% of parts.

Edit: TLDR - EV part stonks go brrrrrrrr.

&#x200B;

Major EV specific parts:

Battery Cells - one of the more expensive parts, actually contain the energy. There's many different types. Large suppliers typically include Panasonic (PCRFY), LG Chem (KRX: 051910), and Samsung (SSDIY). OEMs are also getting more involved in this space through joint ventures / partnerships

Battery pack - basically just an electromechanical assembly of cells. Electromechanical = connect the battery cells, make sure the battery pack is safe, and get rid of heat generated by the cells.

Inverters - basically also motor controllers or variable frequency drives (VFD). All the power to the wheels goes through the inverters so a small increase in efficiency here can be very helpful to increase range. The main component in an inverter is transistors, which are basically a super high power switch controlled by a computer to turn on and off thousands of times a second. SiC (silicon carbide) transistors/inverters are the current standard, but GaN (gallium nitride) could further reduce size & weight and increase efficiency. The ""best"" high power inverters typically use a vertical transistor, which due to engineering reasons is more easily adjusted for different power applications (basically vertical transistors get 3-dimensions of adjustability, while horizontal transistors get 2-dimensions). The GaN vertical transistors are a newer technology, and the early companies stand to make a bunch of money imo. These include GaN Systems & Odyssey Semiconductor (ODII) and many others. Some of these are currently OTC, so you can't trade on Vlad's platform.

Motors/Drive Units - aka the spinny boiz. Lots of companies seem to be designing their own motors from what I found so no specific additional plays. They're being designed in house so that they can maximize efficiency based on how the companies think they'll be used.

Beyond these there are a ton of specific electronic parts that are needed but these are the major ones imo. Once again, do your own DD. I like the stock.

China's biggest semi conductor company TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.

Well - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.

LONG - this company will do very well.

SHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.  Although - I believe this company will explode as soon as any real steps are taken under biden's initiative.

They are a datacenter/5g play [that partnered with Honeywell in October](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vertiv-is-parterning-with-honeywell-on-data-centers-its-stock-looks-promising-51602898166) to reduce power consumption of datacenters (they do a shit ton more with power mgmt but this is the huge shift)

Their next quarterly/annual [looks insane from projections.](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/vertiv-stock-breaks-out-expects-accelerating-eps-growth/) 

 > Digital Infrastructure Stock Vertiv Breaks Out ***Expecting 440% Q4 Growth***

>***With estimates calling for 833% earnings growth for 2020,*** data center and communication network technology leader Vertiv (VRT) has powered up a new breakout.

[Even Simplywallstreet agrees](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-vrt/vertiv-holdings/news/vertiv-holdings-co-nysevrt-is-about-to-turn-the-corner) (but also includes good areas of weakness)

Now you ask yourself, are these guys really doing that much different? [Let me pull some info from their website for you](https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/about/news-and-insights/articles/blog-posts/data-center-cooling-innovation-what-experts-discovered-in-the-vertiv-customer-experience-center/)

* Increased Computing Capacity Demands Data Center Cooling Innovation



* Enhancing Data Center Energy Efficiency with New Technologies

*Where Is Data Center Cooling Innovation Coming From?*
>During the second part of its conference, Vertiv demonstrated and discussed some of its cooling technologies, including:

> Direct Expansion Cooling (which includes the new Liebert¬Æ PDX with variable speed compressors)
Chilled Water Cooling (including the Liebert (P C W) indoor cooling unit, Liebert (O F C) and Liebert (A F C) chillers)
Outdoor Package Solutions (including Liebert (E F C) and Liebert (D S E))
As data centers get bigger, they need innovative cooling technologies to reduce their carbon emissions and help them meet targets for energy efficiency.

> In particular, refrigerants are a ‚Äúkey driver‚Äù of sustainable data centers, said Roberto Felisi, Senior Director, Global Offering Management Core Systems at Vertiv, adding that it is important to have industry certifications to measure the energy efficiency of data center cooling products.

> Other trends in the data center market discussed during the event included growing demand for modular, prefabricated data centers, which are typically smaller and quicker to deploy than traditional ones.

> Lambrecht, said that most of the increasing number of modular Edge data centers will not have staff working in them. That will mean they need to be monitored remotely and have self-repairing technology, he said.

&nbsp;



> In the final interactive Q&A session, *panelists and conference delegates discussed how liquid cooling would help data centers become more environmentally sustainable. Attempts to agree industry standards for cooling technologies, including the Open Compute project, are at an early stage, but they may help achieve this goal.*

>Despite a tumultuous year, speakers and delegates at the event remained upbeat about the future of cooling technologies and the data center industry.

> ***‚ÄúThis is an important moment for the data center industry with regards to what it can do for the world,‚Äù said Albertazzi. ‚ÄúInnovation is key.‚Äù***

***TLDR:*** [Here is a link to a fact sheet you should check out](https://www.vertiv.com/4a782f/globalassets/documents/infographics/vertiv-ig-en-gl-fact_sheet_final_103563_06.pdf) these guys are the real deal, their Executive Chairman is the Ex-CEO of Honeywell that turned the  company around, Vertiv now has partnerships with Honeywell.

This is a $7 billion company with 20k employees reporting *massive financials* coming up.

Their executive chairman is ex-CEO of Honeywell, that guy is the king of turnaround plays.

Well, I finally did my DD and learned I can move all my other positions out of RH so GME isn‚Äôt locked in limbo. 

The process starts with your new broker. For me, I‚Äôm with Vanguard and just initiated the transfer process for my other investments with RH. 

Note that having contracts or margin in play will complicate things. 

Don‚Äôt wait. Get the fuck out of RH.

FSLY shares extremely oversold,44,lngnhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lngnhj/fsly_shares_extremely_oversold/,29,1613772380.0,"FSLY is an ""edge"" cloud computing stock that allows  developers to build, secure and deliver digital experiences at the edge of the internet.  I have made more money trading in and out of FSLY than any other stock this past year and know it well and feel really comfortable buying it in the $80's and selling it above $100.  It yo-yo's up and down in surprisingly predictable fashion on technical indicators.  

So let's get to the current technicals: FSLY shares have a 52 week high of $136 and were as high as $120 just 6 trading days ago but have traded down 6 days in a row and are currently trading at $81 in the premarket.  During this downdraft, FSLY has traded more than one standard deviation below its simple moving average (blue shaded area/bollinger band), dipped below its 59 day moving average and currently reads a 30 on a 14-day relative strength index.  When stocks dip below 50 on a 14-day RSI they become attractive buys, when they approach 30 on a RSI they become screaming buys.  High conviction buy recommendation in FSLY shares with a price target of $120+.",2021-02-20 00:06:20
