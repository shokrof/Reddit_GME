Do Not Transfer From Robinhood,1,lchl16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchl16/do_not_transfer_from_robinhood/,0,1612479985.0,"I mean obviously do it as soon as everything has settled, cuz fuck Robinhood but right now they seem to be rejecting almost all transfer requests. Once the request hits them it will be rejected and they‚Äôll deactivate your account, locking up your assets and cash. You won‚Äôt be able to buy, sell, exercise your options. Literally nothing.

There‚Äôs no phone number to call, your best bet is emailing their hotline and hoping for the best. People on social media have reported it being OVER 2 WEEKS and still haven‚Äôt had their accounts reactivated. And with all the legal shit they‚Äôre about to be going through, don‚Äôt think for a second allowing customers back into their accounts will be one of their priorities. 

Imagine opening your account Friday and seeing GME shooting up rapidly. $300, then $500, then $1000. The squeeze is finally happening. But you can‚Äôt do anything. You can‚Äôt sell, you can‚Äôt exercise those calls. All you can do is sit there and watch your precious tendies get throw into the dumpster behind your local Wendys.

Ford: It's a data company now?,1,lchkzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchkzz/ford_its_a_data_company_now/,0,1612479983.0,"TLDR: Was in Ford for that EV money coming in from the government, but the Google Deal opens up another revenue stream. 

Positions: 230 $15c Jan 2022

https://preview.redd.it/quhsl8g03hf61.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b1b2bda4d0ecf816f47d8986b8dd241603ea2e7

First of all, fuck the suits and GME üíéüôåüçåü¶çüíéüôåüçåü¶çüíéüôåüçåü¶çüíéüôåüçåü¶ç I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad. 

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come. 

If you want to talk fundamentals, it's something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass and putting it into small bags for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over. 

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on. 

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. 

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone for Ford example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic. 

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50). 

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat.",2021-02-05 01:06:23

"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) - Stock poised for breakout, and is relatively unknown, but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month.",1,lchjnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchjnt/atlas_air_worldwide_holdings_aaww_stock_poised/,1,1612479880.0,"Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. 

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

[Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.¬† In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet. 

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.¬† If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company‚Äôs cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.** 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

Literally Can't go tits up.

They want to feel like they are part of the club of the smart people who predicted everything, the paper hands who sold early or never bought in, to begin with.

There is nothing validating about predicting failure, none, it only serves to demoralize your own side and in an effort to prove itself right. It is an excuse to not have to do anything because ""the fight is already lost"" while you feel super smart and try to pull down people who are not cowards, in fear that they might actually succeed.

Maybe we'll succeed, maybe we'll all be rich by the end of this or maybe we won't. That is a possibility. But trying to demoralize people around you does not make you smart, it makes you a coward.

I jumped on the hype train on thursday last week. I could have sold several times but here i am still holding and even buying more with a discount recently. My strategy is to keep buying more to bring my AVG. OPEN down to around 200.00 with the hope to cover my losses or even take off to andromeda. Is there still hope that $GME can reach 200+ again or am i just investing to lose more money? Also is this strategy of mine worth a shot?

Checkmate - The Next Step For GME,96,lche1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lche1c/checkmate_the_next_step_for_gme/,15,1612479476.0,"Lot's of new people in this sub and the posts are getting repetitive and way off track. I want to share something meant to help redirect our focus in general.

During this insane rally, the media has tried to script a narrative regarding what we're all doing here and why we're buying GME, and that narrative is far from reality. 

BUT.....we are playing right into their hands with all of these 'us against them' and 'I'm not selling, I don't care if I lose my money' style posts. It's actually KILLING us, believe it or not.

Why?

Because that is exactly what the hedge funds want the public to believe - this is simply a bunch of idiots trying to pump a dead stock in the hopes of taking down the shorts. 

That narrative is perfect for the HFs because the masses sitting on the sidelines wondering if they should jump in are thinking.....eh, idk. Taking on hedge funds sounds like fun, but these guys always win, the stock just plummeted, I'm not getting involved in that, but I'll root for 'em!

And the fact is, that is NOT what's going on here at all. 

We need to stop with the incessant us vs them posts. That's not what we need at all. Is there an us vs them aspect? 100%. Are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public? Without a doubt.

But the most powerful thing we can do, what will ensure success not only for those currently invested, but for those who join us in helping to bring GME back from the dead is:

WE NEED TO SHARE OUR REASONS FOR LOVING THE COMPANY - OVER AND OVER, CONSTANTLY!!!

I didn't get into this play because of a short squeeze. That's icing on the cake. I got into this play because a savant CEO just took his world class e-commerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40B company in a few years. And he's coming to GME to do it again.

I got into this play because GME now has Ryan Cohen and his crew, along with Amazon's tech engineer as well as Josh Krueger, who handled fulfillment for Amazon, Walmart, and QVC. Those companies have performed okay, right?

It isn't very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 18-50 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most. [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) destroyed Amazon in their niche, and that's saying something.

What happens to the stock price when RC comes out and starts to share his vision? What happens when they name him CEO? What happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential?

 **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ** 

This is an AMAZING value stock. I LOVE IT!!!

If it's worth $800+ in a few years, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.

That all being said, if we constantly post reasons for loving the company, **others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support it's growth**. That's the heart of investing - putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow.

This short squeeze, fast cash, fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative **HAS TO CHANGE**. It's not helping anymore and in fact, it's hurting the company severely.

Yes, we want to expose lying, cheating and manipulation. And it wouldn't hurt to see rich, greedy, assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy. Who wouldn't want to see that?

But that's not why I'm supporting GME and I know it's not why most are either. We need to remember that. And if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise, we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it. That's not collusion. It's not organized trading. It's coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why.

You know what will stop that kind of momentum - **ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.**

And once the rest of the world sees what we see -

The Best COVID Stock You Haven't Heard About - Some DFV Level DD,0,lchcmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchcmx/the_best_covid_stock_you_havent_heard_about_some/,6,1612479363.0,"Sup Autists and Apes,

While everyone has been out there ripping call options on all the COVID Vaccine stocks, I believe I've found the real winner of COVID.   

Let me introduce you to Molecular Partners AG ($MLLCF on the OTC Markets), I like this stock a lot. 

# Who they are:

Swiss biotech company who created an antibody cocktail similar to Regeneron's COVID treatment.

# Why they are the next 10 bagger:

COVID won't been a global pandemic forever, but it's going to be around forever. Much like there are many seasonal flus, there will continue to be many seasonal COVID variants. This makes treatment more of a reoccurring source of revenue than a vaccine. 

And MLLCF's COVID treatment is the only which is not dosed via IV (like Regeneron's). **Which makes it the only COVID treatment that you can get in 5 minutes at any doctor office.** It was also recently reported to be just as effective versus all variants of COVID that have/can emerge.

# Why I felt this was important enough to bold:

90% of COVID patients never go to the hospital, meaning all current treatments miss the vast majority of the addressable market, and MLLCF will be the only available treatment for millions of people worldwide.

# Why I'm posting this now:

After reporting promising data at a recent healthcare conference, they release earnings on Friday 2/5. And even better, their phase 1 data is due out any day now (Q1'21 forecasted release).

# Why I'm in the stock:

I was first introduced to the trade by hearing ""Scientist, Virologist, Healthcare investor / Hedge fund Manager""

Michael Taylor (@biotequity on Twitter, he's been spot on with a lot of calls throughout all of COVID) discuss it back in July. Here's what's happened in the name between then and now:

&#x200B;

* Last summer, MLLCF did a secondary offering and their stock shot up 20%, the opposite reaction we see when companies usually issue more equity. The stock reacted this way as they only did the secondary offering after being approached by investors who wanted a bigger stake in the company, and afterwards, big players felt they hadn't bought enough, so bought much more.
* REGN's clinical data can be interpreted very positively for MLLCF's likely future success, as the treatments are based on similar antibody cocktails.
* NVS signed a partnership agreement with MLLCF back in October. NVS bought 45M of MLLCF stock, gave them 22M upfront, allowed them to keep a 22% royalty on future sales, and embedded a 165M option if trials are successful.
   * All in all, that's nearly a 250M deal for a company that had a 300M market cap earlier in 2020. 

&#x200B;

# Looking at valuation:

Comparable companies without data are trading at a 3B-5B market cap, implying more than 5x potential upside in MLLCF. ***To quote Michael Taylor, ""I don't understand how it's not a 5x""***

This is not investing advice, just some info on a stock that I like a lot. Mark Cuban suggested we do some deep research, so here it is.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

MLLCF will have the only COVID treatment you don't need to be in the hospital for, and 90% of COVID patients don't go to the hospital.

Novartis signed a partnership deal with them back in October that was nearly worth the same as their entire market cap at the time.

Their treatment was recently announced to be effective against all variants of COVID, official phase 1 clinical data is coming any day, and they report earnings on Friday 2/5.

If the trials are successful, which looks promising due to similarities to REGN's and others, this stock looks like it could go from 25 to 100+ based on comparable company valuations. 

**You don't even need to buy options (nor can you), and the stock may have 5x-10x potential this year.**

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen

I am basing this statement loosely on Chewy valuation which is around 43b (I know they are different companies but hear me out). 

First of all. Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.

Both Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets). 

Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product. People like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend.

Would you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.

This, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.

But the fact that I have already lost money, it is pointless for me to be impatient and sell off.  I might as well hold on and be patient.  Every night for a week now I have prayed that things will turn around soon. 

She told me that she thinks (a.k.a. do what I am telling you now) that I should sell and count my losses.  I told her I disagreed.

DD on BlockBuster Stock (BLIAQ),0,lch8fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lch8fa/dd_on_blockbuster_stock_bliaq/,27,1612479021.0,"BlockBuster (BLIAQ) Ticker ‚Äì BLIAQ

For those who do not know what BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) used be a nationally recognized chain that marketed itself as a video and game rental store. BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s used to be everywhere. A BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on one side of the town, another BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on the other side of the town. At their height of BlockBuster (BLIAQ), BlockBuster (BLIAQ) had an annual revenue of $5.9 billion. That‚Äôs a lot of BlockBusters (BLIAQ)!

Many are unaware that BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is still around! Currently headquarters in Bend Oregon, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is able to stay profitable by selling BlockBuster (BLIAQ) T shirts, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) cups, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) videos, and much more BlockBuster (BLIAQ) merchandise.

I believe that millennials and even Generation Y are beginning to spend money on items that they once loved as a child. This means going into a BlockBuster (BLIAQ), renting 4-5 videos and games from BlockBuster (BLIAQ), and experience the BlockBuster (BLIAQ) smell all over again. It‚Äôs BlockBuster (BLIAQ) tastic!

At the moment BlockBuster's (BLIAQ) revenue tops at 1 million with only 50% in debt. They‚Äôre looking to expand their BlockBuster (BLIAQ) footprint within the United States by BlockBustering (BLIAQ) the BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s.

This BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is a long term hold. Theirs‚Äôs no saying when BlockBuster (BLIAQ) will BlockBuster (BLIAQ), but I believe BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is going to be the new BlockBuster (BLIAQ)!

"PLEASE STOP CREATING FALSE EXPECTATIONS (and hold, if you can afford to)",105,lch7qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lch7qm/please_stop_creating_false_expectations_and_hold/,22,1612478969.0," 

**TL;DR: Don't create false expectations. Don't post biased and unfounded analysis. Remain silent and hold. Stay retarded.**

The beauty of all of this (this subreddit in particular and this whole event in general) is the fact that now, more than ever, the regular folk is looking at the stock market and curious about how it functions, leading to a socialization and democratization of the fundamentals behind stock trading. This is gamechanging, and will definitely have a lasting impact that we have yet to behold.

But democratization does not mean instant comprehension. What I'm trying to say is, we can now *access* the knowledge. It doesn't mean we *have* the knowledge, nor that it will come easily or effortlessly.

Stock Market analysis is a very complex discipline. Even disregarding the fact that the system is absolutely rigged (both in paper and in practice) to favour the big fishes in detriment of the little investor, there are still a lot of concepts and dynamics to grasp before one is able to make an accurate analysis.

Michael Burry didn't foresee a crack in the system by comparing two graphs and reading a news article. He had studied the stock market for over a decade before being able to detect the housing market crisis. Even DFV did a fuckton of research before making his move, and is also a financial analyst as far as I know.

What am I getting at with this? That your biased, unidimensional and rushed analysis (""GUYS, I LOOKED AT ONE GRAPH OF THE VW 08 SQUEEZE AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE GME, TODAY IS THE DAY!"") is not helping anyone but the hedge funds. Why? Because you create false expectations, which in turn affect morale and condition people to panic-sell when said expectations are inevitably not met.

The bottomline is, if you don't have anything productive and elaborated to say, you'd better remain silent (and holding), for everyone's benefit.

Thought some folks might enjoy reading today. Have a good one boys!

**Sperm Whale Theory**

1. There's a mega wealthy dude out there (the Sperm Whale) sitting and lurking on the sidelines right now, just waiting for the exact moment to strike and make a move; he's gotten fcked by hedgies before and he wants retail investors to win this time. Plus he knows hedgies are cocky and think they have this in the bag because they are up against a bunch of cash poor apes.
2. He knows there's still going to be big sales/discounts on these volatile stocks in the days ahead while short positions increase as hedgies and well off ""late to the game"" retail investors open new short positions.
3. This thing keeps building momentum on the retail investor side, with little nuggets of inspiration coming out semi-regularly that motivate retail investors to keep holding and buying to the extent it's not ruining their lives (i.e. management team announcements, RH and other trading apps loosening restrictions and not being shit heads, WSB community growing in popularity, govt. getting involved to increase transparency, etc.).
4. Legislation passes and US govt. decides to start sending more COVID stimulus to people.
5. The Sperm Whale, with his massive steel whale balls, opens a HUGE position, buying at an incredible discount of course, and ignites this mthr fckng rocket.
6. Retail investors, having just got their hands on $1400-$2000/each (collectively billions of straight cash from the govt.), go all in on the stocks they like.
7. The stocks they like go to the moon.

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

This would mean that any decision by the Palestinians to fire on Israel would become directly tied to the global economy and the value of the Palestinian currency. Since the threat of war in the Middle East is often followed by a rise in the demand and value of oil, any hostility from Gaza(as the epicenter of mid-east conflict) could effect the price of oil by raising its value, which would thus(in turn) lower the value of the Palestinian currency that's pegged inversely to it. This implies that aggression would have a direct negative implication to the Palestinian economy. In any event, the control over the printing or minting of this currency should be allotted to the Palestinian authorities. This way the peace process directly incentivizes the Palestinians not in terms of land, but in terms of global economic clout since their currency would be intricately tied to world peace and climate change solutions, thus putting some checks and balances on currencies whose value is directly tied to the value of oil and the war machine. The global movement that is trying to get away from war and pollution is something that would easily aid the global demand for this new Palestinian currency.*

I have been watching this battle from the sidelines since the beginning of the month, and after seeing all the trading restrictions going on last week I decided to buy the dip on principle.

With that said the powers that be have managed to drive the price down, and even though GME at 90-100 is still a huge difference from where it was at the start of the year its a far cry from the highs it was driven to. 

I have no actual facts to support this but I would have to imagine the institutions that were short GME at 20 have taken advantage of the dips to get out of those positions and that plenty of institutions were happy to open new short positions when it was pushing 300+

If that happens to be the case aren't those shorts already extremely profitable and not threatened to close that position whatsoever if the price were to plateau? Would a true autist bless me with an explanation of how holding the line here can still force a squeeze in a battle of attrition?",2021-02-05 00:24:08

What I see: Well first, **the squeeze has no squoze**; idc what people try to tell you, that's a fact & they lying. Second, maybe more importantly, a company turning around with a potential to become a gaming **monopoly** under the new management team. (Think about it, how many car brands are there trying to get into EV that $TSLA have to compete with? Now how many retail gaming brand is there that's as big and cemented household name vying for e-sports as $GME? Right.) Know your worth. Invest what you can afford to lose. Don't regret.

Serious post: to the 7 million new frens posting here because they saw some memes and opened a brokerage account with next months rent payment,125,lcgmio,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgmio/serious_post_to_the_7_million_new_frens_posting/,38,1612477238.0,"WSB was originally small-ish and everyone knew what the plays they made were gambles. Everyone knew you would probably not come out ahead. ONE successful play happens and everyone gets pushed out by a flood of 7 million+ retards who don‚Äôt even have any idea what they‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôre just blindly repeating what another equally retarded person told them. 

It‚Äôs gotten bad enough that now I constantly overhear people in public talking about options trading when they clearly have no fucking clue what they‚Äôre on about. So here‚Äôs a few things:

1) ‚Äúhaha you can make so much money selling calls on GME it‚Äôs crazy‚Äù 

Because volatility is high as fuck and only an idiot would want to sell calls on an outcome so uncertain. Your loss selling uncovered calls is infinite. ‚ÄúJust sell covered calls‚Äù they say. What‚Äôs the reason you‚Äôd sell a call? Because you expect the price to go DOWN. Selling a covered call means you have to hold shares of the stock you are betting on going down so congratulations retard, you aren‚Äôt making money, you‚Äôre just minimizing your total loss. JUST because you sold some contracts and collected $10k in premium DOESNT MEAN YOU MADE 10k.

2) OMG *insert broker here* is fucking garbage and is in the pockets of *insert big business here*

Actually it‚Äôs probably because retards like you who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing are making dangerous plays and they know they‚Äôll be stuck with the bill when your naked calls expire and you owe fucking $700,000. It‚Äôs basically them staring at a monkey operating a chainsaw and saying ‚Äúfuck man, you are actually so stupid that I am legitimately scared for my own safety. I‚Äôm taking away your petrol canister‚Äù. 

3 ‚Äúomg you can make so much money buying options‚Äù

You can yes. If you make the right play at the right time. These contracts are intended to be used as a tool for hedging, not a fucking investment in of themselves. If you fully understand the math behind them (you don‚Äôt, because if you did, you wouldn‚Äôt have just joined WSB in the last 3 weeks because of some random ass meme on Reddit) then there are some scenarios to justify making a gamble with options. For most people they‚Äôll get lucky and just lose 100% of their investment. Some people won‚Äôt have any clue what they‚Äôre doing and expose themselves to potentially greater loss than $ they even had in the first place. See that one guy who sold $3500 worth of options to make a quick buck and ended up losing $700,000 and having to sell his house when they expired ITM. 

4 the landscape is always changing

You can‚Äôt hang on to the same old DD that worked last month going forward on meme stonks. Past performance does not predict future performance etc. etc. Don‚Äôt marry your stonks.

tl;dr YOU ARENT A FUCKING STOCK WIZARD BECAUSE YOU READ A SUBREDDIT THAT IS THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT TO SUCKING YOUR OWN DICK IN THE SHOWER EXPECTING IT TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR LONELINESS.

Seeing as how we have strength in numbers, perhaps we could influence our new Boomer broker overlords to keep up with the times. 

I've written and submitted a short paragraph to the technical support side of Fidelity in hopes that we can come together and reform the way they allow us to view and manage our money.

Good Afternoon,

I am writing in hopes of influencing Fidelity to update their current user interface between their mobile and desktop platforms. You are in the unique position of gaining a greater footprint of traders due to recent miss-steps carried out by your competitors. Fidelity is capturing a new wave of younger more technologically savvy investors who want powerful and elegant tools to empower their trading potential. We as the consumer have voted for you with our wallet. It is my hope that you place a greater deal of time and attention into the user interface to ensure you keep up with and stay ahead of your competition.

Tesla overvalued? Or auto industry undervalued?,20,lcgk08,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgk08/tesla_overvalued_or_auto_industry_undervalued/,29,1612477019.0,"First, I apologize for the non-GME related post. Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it‚Äôs overvalued for the last I don‚Äôt know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).

However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon. 

This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford‚Äôs market cap is literally half of NIO‚Äôs (who has 7,000 employees). It‚Äôs hard to justify, in my mind at least.

I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.

But now that these guys are finally making their own EV‚Äôs, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.

I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an ‚Äúenergy company‚Äù and blah blah blah. What do y‚Äôall think? Am I stupid?

# The Hypothesis 

Many of you followed some previous posts on PRPL and have made a money, some of you partook in the great nrpling in the summer of 2020 and lost some money.

This update will be quick. I have reduced my total dollar exposure to PRPL but my exposure is now heavily leveraged with options.

Purple recently touched 41.00 per share and has since made a pull back into the 33-37 dollar range. I believe that the next leg up will require a catalyst and I believe there are 2-3 catalysts coming up. I believe 40 is going to be a short term support level and 50 is attainable by year end.

# The Catalysts

* PRPL is on the cusp of opening a new factory
   * Joe Megibow indicated it would open in February and 1-2 machines would come online almost immediately.
   * I expect a press release will occur when this happens
* PRPL will release a business update
   * Purple didn't give guidance in their november Q3 call. I believe they will issue something soon and if they don't then their conference call will likely occur in the next 5-6 weeks.
* New Partner announcement
   * I believe Purple is going to lean hard into wholesale this year as it has proven very profitable.
   * A nationwide partnership with Mattress firm would be a catalyst. Currently Purple is in about 800 of mattress firms \~3000 or so stores.
* Analyst Upgrades
   * WE recently received big upgrades from Oppenheimer, B Riley and Merrill Lynch. I expect 3-4 upgrades in the coming weeks.

# The professional price Target - 10 analysts, 10 buy ratings

# The Growth Projections don't line up with the massive capacity expansion

&#x200B;

[Analysts are basing price targets on only 23&#37; growth in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/gxi6wr84tgf61.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e235c043f0b08be182198bda89a015cac521ba)

* Prpl ended 2020 with 7 Machines and Joe Megibow indicated 4 machines would come online in 2021 with the possibility of a 5th and 6th also coming online.
* PRPL indicated they would be looking for their 3rd factory in 2021 as they would continue to expand.
* I estimate that Purple will conservatively have \~9.5 machines worth of capacity for 2021 and optimistically 10.25 machines worth of capacity. This would lead me to believe purple will likely achieve 855-1.02B of potential revenue. For sake of projections I will assume they guide on the lower end and over deliver, like always.
* Purple will likely end 2021 with 1.2B in capacity going into 2022.
* Purple has grown from 5M in revenue in 2015 to nearly 700M in 2020...... Dear lord, if you don't understand how impressive this is for a damn mattress company then GTFO.

# Total addressable Market and strong online presence

* Mattress industry is estimated to be 15-20B dollar business in the USA. PRPL currently has about 3% of the market.
* Purple is in \~ 1800 American furniture stores but there are more than 30,000 potential stores.
   * On average I believe that each furniture store contributes about 250 dollars per day to Purple's  top line. By my estimates, purple could achieve another 1.5B in revenue just by expanding wholesale further.
   * [https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/furniture-stores-united-states/#:\~:text=Furniture%20Stores%20in%20the%20US%20%2D%20Number%20of%20Businesses%202001%E2%80%932026&text=There%20are%2027%2C828%20Furniture%20Stores,of%20%2D0.7%25%20from%202020](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/furniture-stores-united-states/#:~:text=Furniture%20Stores%20in%20the%20US%20%2D%20Number%20of%20Businesses%202001%E2%80%932026&text=There%20are%2027%2C828%20Furniture%20Stores,of%20%2D0.7%25%20from%202020).
* Purple is once of the best known brands and although they only have \~3% of the market, the have a disproportional amount of brand awareness on social Media. Purple's advertisements have achieved over 2B in views due to viral marketing.
   * Purple hasn't even scratched the surface of other products such as travel pillows and other comfort tech such as ergonomic pads, etc. A travel pillow alone could increase revenue drastically.

Purple continues to have strong web traffic growth.

# The Moat

* Purple has \~100 patents on their products
* Purple's biggest competitor licenses purple's tech.... Think about that.
* Purple is digitally native and has vast digital presence and is continuing to improve Cost of acquisition.
* PRPL sources most products domestically and they were less affected than most bed manufacturers when the spring shortage occurred in 2020.

Be safe out there. This isn't advice and not all of you can get behind a mattress company, so do your owns research. This is my position as I believe purple will continue to grow healthily even with macro trends being unfavorable.",2021-02-05 00:06:13
A fantastic ETF trade (FTSE100 ETF but Americans can/should get involved too),17,lcgcdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgcdg/a_fantastic_etf_trade_ftse100_etf_but_americans/,12,1612476372.0,"Ok autists, please be gentle (as you can be) as this is my first DD ‚Äì having had double my usual adderall dose this morning (prescribed btw) I‚Äôm ready to write my magnum opus.

Obligatory Disclaimer 1 ‚Äì this has nothing to do with GME, I‚Äôm not encouraging anyone to divest their GME holdings. This is a medium-term play anyway so all you GME holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever. Oblig Disclaimer 2 ‚Äì this is not financial advice of any kind, please do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do work in the US as a risk quant for a pension fund (not a hedge fund) but the fund does not invest in any of the below and I personally make no investment decisions, hence being able to post this.

Brief bit of info/background on me ‚Äì I‚Äôm a cross-Atlantic cross-breed, i.e. an American-British kid. 30 years ago my dad went to the US on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress (no she wasn‚Äôt a stripper or working at Hooters before you ask). I‚Äôm also 30 years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory (just keep them to yourself pls). Oh yeah, as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum (for real) but I think she was full of shit really. Other than that I‚Äôm a pretty boring/ordinary guy generally. My investment thesis is anything but boring however.

Moving on to the idea (you don‚Äôt care about me or my backstory anyway). Actually before then let‚Äôs talk a bit about the UK (or ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù as you Americans always call it in movies). I‚Äôm sure you guys think us Brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like Hugh Grant or the cast of the Crown, but in reality the UK today is pretty Americanised (London anyway). London is also the biggest financial centre in the world after New York, our banks are up there with your big boys JPM, Citibank etc. Also Oxford University (rivaling Harvard) just invented a Covid vaccine.

So onto the investment. Currently I have a significant amount of my portfolio in a 3x leveraged ETF in the FTSE 100 (index of the largest 100 UK companies, equivalent of your Dow 30 really). As a British (as well as American) citizen, I can trade this domestically on Hargreaves Lansdown, but I‚Äôm sure you guys have access to various ETFs that give you the same exposure (Wisdomtree for example).

Despite the vaccine and strong recovery/quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 is still down -20% from its pre-Covid peak, in stark contrast to the DOW or S&P 500 which is at its all-time high. So why is this? Good question ‚Äì let‚Äôs look at some of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100:

\- BP ‚Äì remember these guys, the villains from the Deepwater Horizon movie? Remember John Malkovich in his bad Southern drawl saying ‚Äúwe are a $115bn company‚Äù? Well currently their market cap is $50bn, so there‚Äôs huge potential upside. Yeah sure electric cars are coming along, but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time, especially once air travel comes back. Plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there, it‚Äôs going nowhere anytime soon.

\- Royal Dutch Shell ‚Äì same as above, except they don‚Äôt have a movie about them starring Mark Wahlberg

\- HSBC ‚Äì seventh-largest bank in the world. Up until recently their share price was the lowest it‚Äôs been since 1995, despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times. Also if HSBC ever go under, that means the world financial system has basically ended. So this investment not working out will be the least of your issues

\- Barclays ‚Äì same as above, except they don‚Äôt have any issues/concerns with being exposed to Hong Kong/China. Also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility. No idea why the share price is so low.

\- Lloyds Banking Group ‚Äì as above, another autist made a good DD post on here about LBG recently. Look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so can‚Äôt be arsed to repeat what he said.

\- IAG/British Airways ‚Äì huge airline that‚Äôs obviously struggling right now. But they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis. Also down around -50% from pre-Covid highs.

\- Unilever ‚Äì the guys who make soap and washing-up liquid. Everyone will always need these (well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me)

\- AstraZeneca ‚Äì they just invented a highly effective Covid vaccine. Enough said.

\- BHP ‚Äì huge miner, $200bn valuation. They are actually trading above their pre-Covid highs but likely have more room to grow.

\- British American Tobacco ‚Äì the Covid pandemic hasn‚Äôt cured addiction, people won‚Äôt stop smoking anytime soon. If anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic.

The above are just a few (the biggest) examples of amazing value stocks in the FTSE 100. Of course this is WSB not r/investing, so we need some additional risk. That‚Äôs why I would suggest a leveraged ETF, to amplify your returns. (Disclaimer ‚Äì leverage also amplifies your losses, please don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose).

Ok, you say, well what about the white elephant in the room i.e. Brexit? Well this is WSB not r/politics, so I won‚Äôt say that Brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders. But whilst Brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the UK economy as a whole, the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses. Most of the constituents in the FTSE 100 are $5-10bn+ companies, for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a European entity is minimal (so they still get unfettered access to the single European market). So FTSE 100 companies shouldn‚Äôt feel much pain from Brexit in my opinion, at least not enough to affect this thesis.

Well what about the exodus/brain drain of finance and other professionals to Europe, you might ask? Well Paris is nice but French labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late, which doesn‚Äôt really work for most big companies. Frankfurt is a strong contender to London‚Ä¶ except it‚Äôs one of the most boring cities out there. Imagine moving from New York to Fargo, North Dakota ‚Äì except that everyone in Fargo spoke a different language (although judging from the TV show it seems like they may do anyway). That‚Äôs what it would be like for someone moving from London to Frankfurt (sorry Germany/Fargo).

Ok, so what‚Äôs the risk level of this trade? Well tbh I would say the risk/reward ratio is really good ‚Äì with a leveraged ETF you could conceivably make 100%+ returns in the next few weeks/months. And thinking about it this is really almost risk-free ‚Äì if the FTSE 100 tanks or stays low for the next year or two, in reality that means we‚Äôre all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was Michael Bay‚Äôs ‚ÄúSongbird‚Äù (plotline ‚Äì Covid has mutated to be 90% deadly and we are all still in lockdown in 2024). So at that point you‚Äôll probably be scavenging for food/focused on survival, even if money still exists I can guarantee you won‚Äôt be upset about any money you lost on this trade.

Oh yeah, also the FTSE 100 was down almost 9% last month (January). So investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the near-future.

Autist out (again - pls do your own research this is all just my opinion/autism)

**TL;DR:**

\- Leveraged FTSE 100 ETF is a great way to make 50-100%+ returns over next few months with pretty low risk. Consists of huge oil companies, investment banks that aren‚Äôt going anyway but still down -50% from their peaks (for no other reason than we‚Äôre Britpoors)

\- If this goes tits up then we‚Äôre probably all still quarantined and living in Michael Bay‚Äôs Songbird world in 2 years‚Äô time, so money will be the least of your worries

\- Timing is on your side, the FTSE 100 dropped 9% last month for no discernible reason

\- Brexit is a risk but not that big an issue for these very large companies (see above in the detail)

\- If you don‚Äôt invest in this then you just don‚Äôt like money

\- GME holders don‚Äôt need to panic as this is a medium-term trade over a period of weeks (or even months) so plenty of time to hold your GME if you so choose and come in on this later

\- This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Pls do your own research, this is all just my own opinion/autism.",2021-02-05 00:06:12

He just brought in a shit ton of help and is overhauling gamestop which ALREADY HAS A MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. Lets say if gamestop becomes as valuable as best buy at 30 billion, it would then be worth $500 a share. Without the short squeeze. Honestly with or without the squeeze I'm just gonna hold my shares. 

I originally bought 50@$15 because I liked the company and what Ryan Cohen had to offer. But like a paper handed bitch I sold a few on the way up. Well i bought it all back and much more to a total of 91$99 and I'm NOT SELLING üíéüôå. Many would argue Gamestop is worth at least $100 ($6 billion market cap) based on fundamentals but we dont use that word around here. Trust Cohen and let him do what he does best.

Also what's better than the greatest marketing scheme anyone could have ever come up with? Gamestop went viral and all the zoomers buying xboxes are gonna wanna buy them from Gamestop.

"" The reason the squeeze didn't (and will never) happen... all trading platforms default to ENABLING stock lending. This means that the hedgefunds can keep rolling their shorts by borrowing YOUR shares to pay back the ones they owe, and perpetually postpone buying back their shares until the squeeze threat disappears.  Legally, all platforms must let you OPT OUT of lending out your shares. However, like I said, it defaults to ENABLED and they bury this setting in complicated menus.  It took 20 minutes for me to find the convoluted path to the obscure place that Webull put this setting.  Later, when trying to tell others how I opted out, it took me 20 minutes again to find out how I got there the first time.  Every person on Wallstreet Bets is buying shares to lend out to the hedgefunds.  If you have not opted out of stock lending, then your stock purchases are HELPING the shorters, because you are paying for the stocks out of YOUR pocket so that they can borrow them for free without having to buy them out of THEIR pockets.  How many people on WSB and YouTube are smart enough to opt out? How many people on WSB and YouTube are unintentionally helping the enemy?  This is why the hedgefunds are laughing at you, saying, ""Please! Buy more stocks and hold them with your diamond hands!  You are giving us an unlimited supply of free borrowed stock to juggle our shorts until the day our shorts are profitable, again!""  Also, by borrowing YOUR stocks in a short, they are ripping your stocks right out of your so called ""diamond"" hands and dumping/selling them on the market, driving the price down.  So when you buy 100 shares, in the background those 100 shares are instantly sold on market (even though they still show up in your account). That is how short lending works.  I will not join this movement because the ONLY way the short squeeze can happen is if 100% of the people on the WSB and youtube OPT OUT of ""Stock Lending"".  Not going to happen. People only learned how to use the BUY button. They don't look for the hidden OPT OUT button.  The price rise you see is nothing more than your own created pump and dump, resulting in both losers and winners ONLY ON REDDIT/YOUTUBE SIDE (not on the hedgefunds side). """,2021-02-05 04:34:42

idk man, I bought shares at 300 just to do my part in holding the line thinking it couldn't get THAT low. Now I'm just getting sad cause I keep seeing posts saying ""IT ISN'T OVER! TOMORROW IS THE DAY!"" Then tomorrow comes and I sit there like the ape I am at 9:29 expecting GME to break the stratosphere the moment market opens, only to end the day negative once more. Every time I listen to WSB I lose money then promise to myself to do the opposite of whatever WSB says moving forward. Then I read posts that seem like they know what they're talking about and I think ""Well okay I mean THIS guy isn't that retarded, it actually has a chance of not going tits up."" And then it does, and the cycle continues.

I made some decent money from an option before things really started to kick off. Then my ape brain dove back in, because from what people have been saying, it will undoubtedly go back up because ""Short-ladder attack this"" and ""fake SI values that"" or ""the SEC is lifting it's fucky fuck restriction tomorrow"". Then someone gets a top post with hundreds of shiny awards saying ""Ladder attacks aren't actually a thing you guys just made it up"" then an hour later another post saying ""No dumbass they are actually a thing they're mentioned these articles from 2007-2013"".

A few questions on GME,5,lcmga2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcmga2/a_few_questions_on_gme/,4,1612492433.0,"\-How would the hedge funds have been able to borrow more shares to short during the middle of a supposed ""Short Squeeze""?  Especially when the amount of shorted shares was already 140% of float.  Did anyone of you try and short GME when it was over $300 a share?  Were you able to do it?

\-Why would anyone allow their shares of GME to be borrowed at 18% interest? Especially during a moment in history where the stock has just risen 1700% in a very short amount of time?  Wouldn't those share holders want to capitalize on that momentum and just sell their shares for a huge profit?

\-For the share holders that did have their shares lent out right before the big jump.  Why didn't they all recall their shares at the same time? Then they could make a quick 1700% gain, instead of the 18% annual interest?

\-Lastly, why did the board of GME not issue $100,000,000 worth of new shares when the price hit the $300 range?  Is it still possible there is something up their sleeve, where they believe the price will still go higher than that?",2021-02-05 04:33:53

Until Papa Cohen delivers the news that a share offering has taken place, we will fuel up for our tendie trip.

Cohen and Burry got into this trade because they understood the price was going to go up.  Burry took some profit along the way, but is still in this trade.  Cohen took another step further and got his peeps on the board.  The next logical step is wipe the debt and build the war chest.  The next step happens with an offering.

While I believe there will be two offerings, first to wipe debt and reset the fundamental story.  The second will be when the actual squeeze to Mars happens.  No one on the news is talking about this at all.  There was one reference last week about GME management not taking advantage of an offering, but we know they will.

There's a bunch of questions and challenges though, like:
- Is this legally possible? 
- Would anyone even be interested in donating?
- Is it too late to get this going?
- Needing to ensure that this is done in good faith.

This device is being developed in a phase 2/3 clinical trial now.

Essentially this device using low voltage to open your skin pores, so that the vaccine made be placed in the lipid (fat) portion of your skin. This allows for more direct placement of drug and more efficiency for immunization. 

If any of you were in the military prior to 2005, you would remember a device most commonly known as the ""jet injection"" gun. Essentially using pneumatic air to open the skin pores. The amounts of injections and immunization increased exponentially with the invention and use of this device. The reduction of plastics and needles was great too. Unfortunately, in Mid-2005 the Veterans Affairs put a stop to the devices, stating possible cross contamination exposure. Well, duh, in those days in the military they never would sanitize after each injection. I believe this CELLECTRA device from INO is going to be a revolutionary new method of immunization delivery. 

The other big reason this company is unvalued in my opinion. Inovio has been doing their research and discovery without the help of Big BioTech firms. They are the only independent biotech company I have found with a Covid-19 vaccine without the oversight or partnership of the big tech.

Happy Hunting.

You guys say OHHHH, WE'VE TRIED TO COMBAT THE CORRUPTION, BUT NO ONE LISTENED, SO NOW IM GONNA HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS. Jsyk, it doesn't hurt them all that much.

Fact of the matter is, by basic statistics, about half of you don't know who your state representatives are, don't know what district you're in congressionally and also don't understand domestic/foreign politics. You claim that they're all corrupt, but who is exactly? is it suddenly news to you that Hedge Funds conduct illegal actions? Is it really news suddenly that the media is lying constantly? Is it REALLY A SHOCK that all of a sudden congressional leaders are acting corrupt?

If you were all really conducting a revolution based on these premises, your revolution should've started long ago, around 2010.

Now that you've all put yourself in a position where the corruption is affecting you personally in a sensory verifiable way (losing all your damn money on a meme stock and looking at the RH line graph), you're all suddenly political and social warriors when you should've been long ago.

The theory that tons of shorts exist is somehow off base and nothing ever materializes for the retail investor.

* Citadel walks away with a black eye and hefty fines
* SEC is left with little choice than to update their rule book going forward.
* WSB lives on and its members post their YOLO losses, like so many times before and say 'Hey, we're retards. Who ever told you otherwise?'
* WSB membership has a drop off that looks like a Short Ladder attack and we can all do some analytics on how many shill accounts get created when social media buzz fever catches.

* RH is *still* finished 
* Citadel walks away with a black eye and hefty fines
* SEC is left with little choice than to update their rule book going forward. [This time tipping the scales so that retail investors have to find different approaches]

* Your aunt Karen is pissed at you. She's not going to get over it b/c she's not seeing any of your F'ing money anyhow.
* Your wife's boyfriend is pissed off b/c you told him he can keep her and he has no clue what to do now.

MAJOR Issue with Robinhood account transfer to TD Ameritrade.,2,lcm8po,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcm8po/major_issue_with_robinhood_account_transfer_to_td/,4,1612491877.0,"Hello everyone. I am super stressed out, and wanted to get this out to see if anyone is experiencing the same issue. 

January 28 was the date where Robinhood started to restrict sales for GME, AMC, and others. I was holding GME, AMC, and BB, and sold them all before the crash later that day. Paper hands, yeah yeah, but I'm not made of money.

I shared the universal frustration towards Robinhood that the entire internet felt that day and since, and decided to transfer my entire account from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade. I sold the meme stocks, but was still holding my long-terms. I went to TD Ameritrade and submitted the transfer.

About a week passes, and I wake up this morning to check if my transfer was completed. Robinhood FUCKING transfered GME, BB, and AMC to my TD AMERITRADE ACCOUNT AFTER I HAD SOLD THEM! And my transfer was only half completed as well. There was also a negative cash balance of $1000 in my TD Ameritrade account.

On the Robinhood side of things, I had negative shares(yes, negative shares) of all the meme stocks in my portfolio. All of a sudden, around 10:30 the negative shares disappeared and Robinhood RE BOUGHT the shares on my behalf to cancel the negative shares out even though my account was still technically ""deactivated"". Now, I have a negative buying power of $-500 in Robinhood, along with the $-1000 in TD. 

I called TD Ameritrade(Where you can actually speak to a real person.., unlike Robinhood) and they said that this was entirely Robinhood's error. The woman I spoke to said she has seen thousands of Robinhood transfers get fucked up because of their doing, and that I have to go to RH's support to resolve it. The only problem is Robinhood's support is incompetent and will probably take days to email me back. 

I just wanted to post this for two reasons. The first is to see if anyone else has experienced this, and the second is to serve as a PSA of NOT to transfer your account from RH to anywhere. Liquidate your stocks into cash, fund your bank, then fund your new brokerage. It's what I should've done, now I need to either wait till RH resolves this shit or lawyer up.

Are you here to make a quick dime? Then bad news, you are way out of your league here. So am I, by the way, if I'd be here to make money. You will need a shitload of research to make it in this business and even then, you might see your stocks head on a pike someday because safety is  the last thing wall-street is offering. If you are a üßª ‚úã, then fuck right off. Sell what you have because neither the revolution nor the corpus is for you. Save what ever you have and be gone.

**But do me one favor:** Don't go around telling people to save themselves, to sell, to jump shit. No matter how retarded we may be, we stand together, dick in hands, red numbers slapping our faces with taunting big red minuses but we agreed to stand each other, even if we loose everything. Don't take this moment of camaraderie and retard-hood away or spoil it. We stood together, we fought together and we may win...or loose...or who knows what. But what ever we did, we weren't pitiful about it.

To all my apes, no matter what the next days might bring, this was and still is one hell of a ride and I couldn't imagine a wilder and better community to have the ride with!

Think about the stock. Week of jan 22 it‚Äôs around $50. Hype builds like crazy. Then volume for nuts. 

Yes WSB had a lot of people buying but now we are hearing about all these other Hedgefunds who made hundreds of millions off of this. 

Then look at the price, $50 hype builds. It shoots up to $400 then dives hard, then shoots up again then restrictions. 

What happened? HFS saw the hype and bought in massively. Drove the price up. At peak they sell. We see a massive dip, we go wow! BUY! Those HFS who just sold also recognize there will be another momentum peak so they also re buy. Then Melvin and co shit their pants and do their fuckery, al these other HFs hear this info in the inside so again dump, they dump hard. Dives the stock again, and now we can no longer buy due to restrictions. 

They throttle the stock, the rich stay rich and now Melvin will just do ladders until they tank the stock to where they don‚Äôt lose their ass.

There was a reason why millions were spent on a media blitz falsely claiming we were investing in silver and looking at other stocks. 

If GME was worthless, if the shorts already sold, if they couldn‚Äôt care less about it or us then why the massive effort to divert attention from the stock and to drive the price down. 

The media blitz happened on the Monday after the GME surge. If the shorts exited on Friday then why the effort on Monday to drive the stock down?

Why is RH slowly allowing more people to buy more shares this late in the week? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre hoping you lost interest, are discouraged by the dip and won‚Äôt buy. 

I don‚Äôt know shit about stocks but what I do know is that I don‚Äôt care about things that don‚Äôt have an impact on me. I wouldn‚Äôt care about an anthill being destroyed in Africa unless I lived in it. So why would a hedge fund care about the price of GME if they already exited?

It was no coincidence that the guys who owned a billion in silver launched a false campaign that Reddit was suddenly investing in it. They needed more money for something. Maybe it was to cover their losses if they already exited but then there wouldn‚Äôt be a massive media blitz to drive the stock of GME down after the fact.

Congratulations, you're slightly less retarded than half this sub and probably belong at /r/investing . You're already balls deep on calls/stock pickups, the price went down this morning after a positive earnings beat, and you think you're holding a loser.

Chill the fuck out.

**$NOK$** prior to 2021-01-22 was trading FAIRLY flat for the last year with price averages between **$3.30** & **$4.60** (With some larger swings). What happened? Hype. Price shot up to $9.79, share buying was blocked, and paper hands took their tendies and ran.

So you're sitting here holding stock that's worth less than half of what you paid for it. What now? Dilute your shares and buy the dip. We've seen heavy support at the **$4.30** price target today and price swings up from this point. Set your limit order at this price and buy as much as you can afford. Is this proof you have a gambling problem? Probably.

Will the price ever go back up? Of course it will. Price targets for this stock are fairly consistently above current market price. While the entire market is retarded, you can't beat good fundamentals/[earnings beats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-q4-earnings-revenues-151303550.html)/[market positioning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html)/[new technology](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/). Current consensus prices (from the conservative banks) put price target at **$5**, you'll make money even in the worst case. [Majority of firms prior to March 2020 doomsday held price targets between $7-$6 on the stock.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/NOK/price-target/) This is **a rough 50% lift** from current prices.

**TLDR:**  

* Pick up **$NOK$** cheap on the dips (my re-entry has been at the $4.30 support point but pre-hype prices **~$4.20**)  

* Dilute your holdings if you're underwater (just keep pumping in money)  

* Chill out and watch the market capitalization this year

* 4,424 Shares @ $4.34  

* 7,865 Shares @ $4.50",2021-02-05 04:19:49

We are being cheated out of our gains once again by big money. Fear not, I know many of you have just recently hopped on the GME train, but as someone who has been in this stonk for months, it moves like a MOTHERFUCKER. Within 2 days of buying my shares I was down about 40% (shoutout the u/jeffamazon post for the GME OGs)  


GME moves erratically and I've honestly gotten used to the violent ups followed by the violent downs. Suck it up and hold the fucking line!!! 

The stock market is ""the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient"" -Barren Wuffet. 

Don't be the impatient retard, its only a loss if you sell!!! 

This is far from over, buckle up, double down, whatever you gotta do, don't you fold. You can bet your ass these low prices are enticing to big money, idk about you guys but I didn't hear no bell.

I love and respect every single one of you diamond handed champions, we will be rewarded in the end. Stay strong brethren, many good things coming to GME gang.

Obligatory: I am not a financial advisor but I can advise you which colored crayons taste the best.

I'm curious to see what you all were looking forward to. 

Here's mine:

- a big fluffy koala onesie lol

- new glasses + eye exam

- a good, private health insurance for sister + mom, so they can get therapy

- dental work

- tutors for math + a language

- floating shelves for my books (all currently in boxes)

- a camcorder to practice film-making

- bribe money to watch skilled ppl do their thing and bother them with questions 

- bribe money for ppl to help with creative projects/be my friend 

- reinvest the rest with the goal of having a fund I can draw from throughout the years for things that are not essential, but would make life better",2021-02-05 04:12:59

By now I think it's safe to assume that most people have sold their GME shares. Oh, I'm sure a few die-hards will jump in to tell me they're never selling, but 90% of us have moved on. That's fine.


So...what did we learn?


-----


**THE GOOD**


**Shares, Not Options**


Who would've thought, right? Oh, sure, a lot of us had a few options and made a killing off those, but the majority of the money made on GME was in shares. Obviously, the short squeeze potential drove that more than anything, but I think it's important to look at why else it worked.


GME brought in a LOT of new investors who know nothing about the market. I bet 99% of people don't know how to buy options or how they work. But anyone can buy shares. And buying shares probably saved a ton of us from buying FDs and blowing up our accounts early. So when GME was initially surging from $30 to $100, we kept buying shares instead of going for the home run.


I think that's something to keep in mind on any future plays. We all love our options, but shares were key to this for more than just the squeeze.


**We Moved the Market**


GameStop was obviously the big one, but AMC and Express were saved from bankruptcy. We brought attention to BlackBerry, which just needed a little bump and is a legitimate company. That's really cool. I love GameStop and going to the movies, and I'm glad we're not seeing more companies go under due to the virus.


We didn't do this all on our own, though. What we provided was that initial spark. Once the big guys saw what we were doing, they piled on. That's a good thing. It means they saw the same things we did, just not as early.


**We Have the World's Attention**


We dominated the world and financial news for about a week. They made jokes about us on SNL. Your grandparents know what wallstreetbets is now (a chat room, right?). The White House was monitoring the situation.


The whole world is now watching and waiting for us to decide which stock is the next big play. Even the worst DD posts now could send a stock skyrocketing because people will have severe FOMO from GME and the others.


All because we liked a stock and decided to buy it. Cool.



-----


**THE BAD**


**We Pissed People Off**

Now, we do this all the time, but it's usually limited to each other and the real world never knows about it. We pissed off short sellers, hedge funds, the media, analysts, and the SEC.


You may think, who cares? Fuck 'em. And I agree, to an extent. But together they have the power to prevent us from doing anything like this ever again.


Oh, and they all lied about us, the stock, everything. Everyone. So expect that to continue.


**People Lost Big**

I know we love our loss porn, but there were people buying-in for the first time at like $400/share. Anyone doing this was taking enormous risk, especially when a lot of us got in when the price was in the teens and averaged up to the $40s.


If this was you, you learned an expensive lesson. Don't chase.



------



**THE UGLY**


**Hivemind Got the Best of Us**


At some point, around $300/share, we should've all taken a look at where we were at and re-assessed. I'm not blaming, because I'm guilty of it, too. We downvoted ANYONE who questioned why we weren't taking profits or had legitimate concerns about numbers that were coming out.

That's a real problem. And when the information started to turn against us (eg. the S3 short interest report), we should've known it was time to get out. Even if it was false, there were enough red flags by that point. This started out as a sure thing - 140% shorted, shorts extremely underwater, losing $, etc. Once that narrative started to shift, we risked the stock price tanking.


**New DD Will be a Mess**


Seriously. Take ANY new DD with a fucking gulp of salt, because the pumpers are coming. We made millions off of GME, and there's no doubt someone is out there just salivating at the thought of pumping up a shitty company in order to profit.


Now, more than ever, it's extremely important for you to pay attention to a poster's history and really do your own research on a company. If you're not comfortable holding shares for a long time, then don't buy the stock. I personally loved GME's potential, even without a short squeeze, due to their management and vision. My plan has always been to ride the squeeze to the top, then buy back in and hold it for years. Nothing about that has changed.


Oh, and do you want to know what the next short squeeze will be? I'll tell you right now:


**NONE.**


**THERE ARE NO MORE SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITIES SO STOP FUCKING LOOKING FOR THEM.**


If you see a post about the next short squeeze, just move on. It's not happening. Period.


You think things were bad before? Just. You. Wait.


-----



**TAKEAWAYS**


The biggest takeaway for me has been how people changed their tactics when it came to GME in particular. Buying shares was key. That was the game changer.


Additionally, people with legitimate concerns with evidence to back them up should at least be heard. It's one thing to downvote a shitpost. Quite another to laugh at someone for suggesting there might be something we're all missing.


Remember when people laughed at DFV? Sometimes it's good to listen to contrary opinions.


-----

Oh, on an unrelated note: GME shares are approaching my personal re-buy price of around $50/share. This is what I believe the stock's fair value is without any potential short squeeze. With Ryan Cohen's leadership, I think this company will have a nice turnaround. I wouldn't be surprised to see it legitimately trading at around $100-$150/share in the next year or so. Not a recommendation to buy, I just love this stock. üöÄ",2021-02-05 04:10:28

When the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).

https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/could-retail-traders-move-the-price-of-oil-the-short-answer-is-yes-51612461230

So now we've entered the world of completely fabricated narratives about retail traders and Reddit, in particular.

What they don't know about oil stocks and Reddit is that young retail traders consider their stock buying to be actual investments in the world that they want to have in the future. They buy stocks that they like. They bought $GME, $TSLA and some of these other short-busting stocks, because they like the stocks. 

Retail traders at Reddit like clean energy, new technology and the things that they like having in the world, like Gamestop. They don't like oil stocks. 

So now we're in the world of financial news writers just making shit up and repeating each other's narratives in an echo chamber, trying to pump SLV, XLE or whatever next thing they can make a quick return on.

They're writing fake/misleading stories about Reddit for quick pump-and-dumps, like they did with SLV.",2021-02-05 04:05:13

They were my  first brokerage and I learned a lot along the way. But  that ends today.

After  that  bullshit they pulled last week its over. I stood by them  through their  past service outages, bad fill orders, and straight up  crashes at  crucial moments. I figured its ok, they are growing and  trying to keep  up with the big brokerages. I made excuses for them. But  the thing is,  they have always been a shitty brokerage. Those past fuck  ups were also  unacceptable, and the trading restrictions we saw recently  should be  the final nail in the coffin for them.

"rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)",156,lcllg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcllg0/rwsb_is_losing_direction_and_becoming_fractured/,18,1612490247.0,"First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:

\- The OG WSB crew

\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big

\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show

\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock

\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf

**You'd think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**

\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion

\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.

\- Some people are selling because they CAN'T or SHOULDN'T be making any more losses (totally fine)

\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)

\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.

**Whatever the ""right"" move is, I think it's important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\***

If you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost

If you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I'm sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn't/couldn't want to buy/hold, then get lost

**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don't put others down**

As for the proposal: 

Before people, I'm not calling for people to sell GME. While I'm skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you're holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you

**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:

\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It's simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND

\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time

\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won't maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)

\- It's received a bunch of coverage. It's simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock

\- The argument could be made that there's still value to be made off of a short squeeze

In short, **I'm proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let's not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**

**TLDR: in bold**

\* It's important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression",2021-02-05 03:57:27

What matters is that Melvin still has to buy more shares than there ever are on the order book. Volume is low so eventually they‚Äôll be forced to fill every sell order no matter the price. You buy it for 50$ now and place a sell order at 50K$, Melvin has to buy it for 50K$ at some point.

They HAVE to. It‚Äôs not a choice. There‚Äôs not enough volume for them not to. There‚Äôs not enough stock in circulation for them not to.

""The most entertaining outcome is the most likely."" - Papa Musk

This is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.

I am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the ""Planet of the Apes"" theory.

The case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.

Long Rant:
So there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.

One of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.üíéüíé‚úä‚úä 

We all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.

Now let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.

Now of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.

What does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. 

TLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story.

I held and held, and for what it seemed like an eternity, the price started to creep up and by pre-xmas I broke even. 

Over the last week or so, I held through almost 43k profit, and watched it tumble down to where it is now. Are the naysayers trying to convince everyone the squeeze has happened again? Yes. Did I sell? No. 

I have full faith that $500 is not even close to the highest we can squeeze out of these corrupted HFs, and I hope those who are still holding now but tempted to sell for what meager profits/losses re-consider, because you don't want to look back in a few days/weeks time and see everyone else celebrate our early retirement gains.

""17k in profit? Omg take the money and run.""

""Jesus christ really? You can just take that money out? Right now? 33k? For real?""

""Dude bullshit that app is fake my cousin uses that. You did not make 67k."" (Talking about RH, lol)

""82k? No fucking way.""

I know I don't have to tell you guys what it's like to be on high alert. Not sleeping good. Generally anxious. Forgetting to eat. I was like this for 5 weeks. I went from making 22k per year to 20k per day and I was so anxious and manic I was ready to snap from all the pressure.

And that was when I was clearly ahead. Right now with GME, it feels almost the same as when I was ahead with tesla.

I made myself a sandwich in the haze of the blending days of sleep deprivation. I was between rounds of simultaneously shopping for a house and a car. I was so fucking delirious.

I made a ham sandwich. Took a bite, and it was the best thing I've ever tasted. I calmed way the fuck down after that. Drank a bunch of water and went on a walk. A few weeks later RH fucked me and I lost all but 18k. When I learned the news I laughed about it. It hurt but not nearly as bad as I thought it would.

The key to all this emotion and stress is to take yourself off high alert. Drink some water, go for a walk, eat a sandwich. Just try to actively disconnect for an hour and process.

but if you're decided that this is going to be more than a money bath that teaches you something and instead a trade that teaches you nothing, here's why you should buy more right now.    

1. it's cheap as dog shit right now. besides the fact that the stock is great and i like it there is always the possibility of a second squeeze, especially with how much is still shorted. 
2. robinhood decided that now they can play fair and are letting retail buy up to 500 shares
3. most importantly, you can hedge your losses using cheap shares.

assuming you bought at the ridiculous price of 380: if you were to do nothing and GME were to go up to 230, congrats, you're now down ~40%. not much better. but if you were to buy an equal number of shares at 80 as you bought at 380: going up to 230 has you break even. moreover, you've now got more shares than you started with, so each dollar above 230 is two (or however many shares) dollars of profit to you. hedge your bets with more cheap GME! if you were to buy double your original shit investment, it would only have to go up to 155 for you to break even. assuming GME goes up from here, which i think it will because the floor of diamond hands seems to be ~80, you can find ways to profit even if you're losing on your initial trade.",2021-02-05 03:44:52

I would like to take a moment to say thank you to all the new information, sources and insight given by everyone here. Secondly I‚Äôm new to active trading and stocks other than dropping money in and never looking into it. 
I‚Äôm new to WSB, Reddit (I just looked at Jeep stuff before WSB) and I actually got into really applying my money into stocks for long term investments in 2018. October 2019 I decided to make allotments to have reoccurring investments. So much to speak that I‚Äôve built a ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù and was up and down day after day. Never paid attention. In December 2020 is when the idea of ‚Äúmy money make money for me‚Äù came to me and I tried. Few weeks later this GME thing hit and I made some very ‚Äúemotional calls‚Äù mixed with FOMO. 

With those calls came MANY lessons. Some takeaways to all my fellow new investors that I‚Äôve learned and I hope people can learn from my mistakes without going through:


A.) Never invest/gamble/stock play with what you cannot afford to lose. This goes without saying. 

B.) A loss is only a loss if you look at it in such a manner. Where you have a loss there‚Äôs a learning lesson and as boomer as it sounds with knowledge comes power; the power to take past mistakes and fool proof your future plans. 

C.) The stock market is a vicious and volatile area and money can be made as fast as lost. It IS possible to recover, learn how, do your DD. 

C1.) The stock market is not for everyone. Short term investments with high hopes of a fast bucks can become a long term ordeal that you may or may not be ready to handle. 

D.) Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. 

These are just some key points I‚Äôve jotted down on my notes to myself and as I said, If even one young investor can pick something from this and benefit 
from my mistake then it‚Äôs worth it.

What's the point on selling and losing money?  


a) If i sell i'll lose money.  
b) If i hold and we win i'll make money fast.  
c) If i hold and we lose i'll make money in a few months when the theaters go back to business.

Its not the intrinsic value before the shorts and the DFV info was $30 now with all the free advertising, New board and ""goodwill"" the realistic intrinsic value has to be raised to $35-40. Back of my hand numbers but you get the point.

I don't care what you bought at. The current price is $70, so your down side is $30 a share. However if the short information is correct (and we will see on the updated numbers fairly soon) there WILL be another gamma squeeze so the price is likely going to hit the highs we saw last week again so $450+. We can also have the upside of the short squeeze, which can go way higher.

So there is literally no point paper handing at this point. All you are doing is making gamma and short squeezes less likely. The upside (390 on a gamma way more on a short squeeze) vs downside (30 now) is massively in our favour! So even if you think there is 10% chance of it happening its a good bet. 

DFV and all the apes (which I am one) knows this and is still holding, I trust him more than some bots! If anything the bots just show how desperate the hedge funds are, Think about it, if they had covered why would they care whats happening now.

Sometime later the share is bought back and returned and the short seller pockets the difference. 

My question is this, when shares are shorted and the share is immediately sold at the current market price, does the brokerage count this as a sell on their volume reports immediately following the short sale or do they record the sell when the shares are returned?

You're an idiot if you don't have some WKHS in your stable,23,lcl2oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcl2oj/youre_an_idiot_if_you_dont_have_some_wkhs_in_your/,15,1612488913.0,"Positions: 55 shares @ $36.22 (Not a big position, but whatever, it's what I could afford.)

The Low-Down:

Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.

The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).

Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.

Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.

Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ >100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.

TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.

EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition. 

However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says ""USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions"" will play a lot better than ""USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030""",2021-02-05 03:35:13

From my experience as a long time customer and former employee, I wouldn't be saddened or surprised if they went under.

That being said, I bought stock in GME and AMC everyday since the 26th and I plan on holding. Not only is there potential for thick gains, but it is a chance to stick it too the financial elite AND profit from a shitty company that didn't do right by its staff or customers.

Now a lot of the loss porn and position posts on here don't reflect the situations of the Average Joe. I, like many other hopeful retards on here *don't have* $60k to throw at a stock just because **""lol diamond hands ape togehter stronk"",**

**You have to take more calculated risks and assess what is right for your situation and your wallet.**

Even with the falling prices, media hailstorm, and fear setting in; I remember something that Warren Buffet said, ***""Wall Street is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient""***. I hold because I have seen investments climb out of a trench and net me profits, but don't let anyone tell you what is the right thing to do.

**- Never invest (gamble) more than you are comfortable losing**

**- Know when to walk away from the table (take a break and come back)**

**- Fast money is fleeting and unreliable, be patient and do your DD**

**- Selling is not a weak move, your morals don't have to align with this subs. Your wallet and wellbeing is the biggest motivating factor.**

CureVac - Vaccine Printer Go BRRRRR,17,lcl0h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcl0h0/curevac_vaccine_printer_go_brrrrr/,13,1612488759.0,"Alright you retards, this subreddit seems to have become a place for $GME and nothing else lately, but since all the new autists arriving here have probably been losing their tendies on gamestonks, I thought I'd try giving some actual DD so people can make money instead of losing it.

So what's the play?  $CVAC, currently trading at around $111.50 a share, with a market cap of 19.71B.  They're in phase 3 trials of their covid vaccine right now and have been signing deals left and right, such as:

[https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/gsk-joins-forces-with-curevac-to-manufacture-its-covid-19-vaccine-and-to-develop-another/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/gsk-joins-forces-with-curevac-to-manufacture-its-covid-19-vaccine-and-to-develop-another/)

[https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany](https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany)

[https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html)

I'm expecting phase 3 trial results from them early next month, mostly based on this, which has the trial set to conclude on March 4th or 5th:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102)

This is earlier than I expected, due to the trials being initiated on December 22nd to my knowledge, but maybe it's accurate?  Anyways, if any of you have followed Novavax ($NVAX), their stock price went to the moon a few days ago when they announced that their vaccine worked, and I'm anticipating a similar large move in $CVAC if their vaccine works.  From what I've read about their phase 1 and 2 results, and seeing large deals being signed each week now for distribution, I'm expecting phase 3 results to show that the vaccine works.

Now there is a counterargument to this, mainly that they already have a higher market cap than $NVAX, will be able to produce less of their vaccine, and their vaccine will have most likely have lower efficacy than $NVAX: [https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240](https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240).  Also obviously their vaccine might not work, but I don't think this is likely.

However, I am of the belief that they will exceed these delivery numbers and may engage in more partnerships to produce their vaccine candidate once it is proven to be effective.

Additionally, DADDY MUSK is in their corner, with Tesla having partnered with CureVac to develop mRNA printers capable of printing multiple different vaccines: [https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/](https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/)

When their phase 3 trial results are published and they shoot up like $NVAX printing tendies for all you're gonna be salty you didn't get in on that sweet action.

Positions: I hold calls for March 21 as well as shares, if you wanna be safer with guessing when their phase 3 results will be out maybe go for April 21 calls.  I'm poor so I don't have that many calls or shares, and I also lose money a lot so maybe this DD sucks.  If the SEC is watching, this is not financial advice, just my retarded DD

TLDR: Vaccine printer go BRRRR when they announce their vaccine candidate phase 3 trial was successful, likely early next month.",2021-02-05 03:32:39

How I think this will all play out (Diamond Hands!),96,lckzoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lckzoz/how_i_think_this_will_all_play_out_diamond_hands/,15,1612488700.0,"My Prediction: Diamond hands, GME, and HFers will come out of this okay, at the expense of paperhands and non WSB retail investors. How will this play out? WSB retailers are now wise to the game: HF and MMs control the price of the stock and the mainstream media. This time, we are in control of the shares. HFs need those shares, but diamond hands aren‚Äôt giving them up. So how do the HF‚Äôs get them back? By making average cnbnc viewers buy them. But how?

Massive short laddering and FUD campaigns are an obvious ploy at shaking out any paper porn toys they can find. Every paperhand folding now is a cheaper share they need to buy back. Anyone left with skin in the game is gonna be hard to shake off, but HFers aren‚Äôt gonna just pay up. How will they get the average retailer to pay up?

There are a massive amount of 3/19 800$ calls that have been purchased. HFers will use this to recover some of their money. One day, between 2/5 and 3/19, GME price will skyrocket from 90-100$ all the way up to 500$, as HFers cover their shorts. Some of us will cash out our investments, and leave a few shares to speculate, others will fully cash out. CNBC and CNN will be screaming from their platforms that the short squeeze has begun, and everyone should pile in and get those sweet gainz. Average retailers will pile on, driving the price up to somewhere between 500-1000. Then, the HFers will ladder the stock down to 100, shaking down new paperhanders for cheap shares. They‚Äôll leave it back at 100 for a few days to see if any other paperhanders walk off. CNN/CNBC will help drive off investor confidence with FUD campaigns. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, HFers will get the shares they need by buying these shares up on the cheap from paperhanding retailers trying to get in on the squeeze, not knowing that HFers and MMs can artificially control the price of the stock through a combination of short laddering and short buybacks. Combined with the 2/5 puts, the 3/19 calls, and the massive swings in price that the HFers can control, they will make all of their money back.

Final outcomes? Diamond hands will make big gains. No way are we getting back in at 500 if we know they can short ladder down to 100. Average retailers will come in and buy shares from diamond hands for 1000$ hoping it will go to 2000$ the next day, only to paperhand them to HFers for 100$. New retailers will flock to WSB to see the massive gains as folks cash out, get greedy, buy in, only to get slaughtered the next day. WSB will be filled with gain and loss porn. GME will come out as a multibillion dollar company with a share value from 100-300, with strong investor confidence. CNBC and CNN will hail WSB as a hallmark moment for the little man that saved GME and will change the game forever.

WSBers will forget about the short ladder attacks, the FUD campaigns, the trade freezing, etc., because hey, we made money right? Anyone who bought in at 500 and held on for dear life will have a chance of getting out. Hell, WSBers will be laughing at the average retail investor that gets slaughtered, because they should have known better, right? A few hedge funds will walk out making massive gains, a few hedge funds will implode, and nothing on wall street will change, except they‚Äôll start taking WSB a lot more seriously. The average retail investor will continue to get screwed by wall street because they don‚Äôt know that wall street controls the pricing on stocks.

Bulls make money, Bears make money, Pigs get slaughtered 

TLDR: HFers are gonna do everything in their power to make the common retail investor the pig. If we diamond hand this, HFers will find greedy paper hand investors to buy our shares for them.

Someone did it for me the other day and I want to pay it forward"".  I was floored. I haven't felt that good in a long time and it kinda brought a tear to my eye. I assured him that I would do the same for someone. I was getting lunch for myself at a different restaurant and I paid for the guy behind me in the drive-thru. Man what a good feeling. There is a lot going on in this world as you all know. Covid, these dumb stocks, stupid people causing riots and on and on and on. You never know what kind of day someone is having or what they are going through. I'm an out of work drummer thanks to covid but luckily my wife does pretty good so we are ok. But there are a lot of people down on their luck right now. I often think of the people who have yolo'd into $gme and I am hoping things will blow up more for them than me.

NO ONE KNOWS. JUST BE PATIENT. LEARN A NEW HOBBY. START WORKING OUT. DON‚ÄôT STARE AT THE MARKET ALL DAY, IT WILL DO NOTHING.

You were used by the founder of this sub. He did nothing to help the sub during the GME runup, he hadn't been involved at all for a long time before hand. But he's just sold the rights to his 'life story' to a movie producer for low six figures

2. You were used by other hedge funds. Here is one story, but there are plenty that made money off the run as well. They never cared about Wallstreet or funds over extending themselves with a short bet. All they saw was a momentum play, and they played it. You made it easier for them by making market sentiment completely transparent.

3. You were used by me too. I didn't play it anywhere close to perfect, but I made a good chunk of money buying/selling calls during the run up. My biggest mistake was underestimating the volume and I hedged my longs by selling calls which really ate up my potential gains. I did get in and out though, and paid off a substantial amount of debt.

4. You will continue to get used by investment funds going forward. There are already news articles up today about ""hottest stocks on reddit!"" The mainstream media is so easy to manipulate (since they have no interest in fact checking financial news) that big players will continue to use the media to pump and dump securities.

5. You are getting used by people with a political agenda to push their narrative. ""WSB is leaving out anyone who isn't a straight white male!"" for example

6. You've been used by other stock market subs as entertainment and as a lesson. Go ahead and take a look at /r/stocks or /r/options. They've been making fun of the echo chamber in here for days now.

7. It is at least a possibility that you'll get used in a good way. Perhaps, just maybe....politicians will use this fiasco as a springboard to make real change. Maybe when a hedge fund takes a short position then hires a PR firm and a private investigator to ""look into"" a company they've shorted, this will need to be public information. Maybe when an ""analyst"" goes on TV to pump or short a stock they have a stake in it will need to be completely clear that they stand to financially gain from the ""advice"" they are giving.

There is a chance this could happen. But, what I think will actually happen is rule makers will look at this as ""what can we do to make sure this never happens again?"" and come to the conclusion that short interest can and will be even less transparent going forward.

The problem is that the Biden administration is very entrenched in wall street's interests, and the SEC can really only issue fines (they won't ban anyone from the stock market over this). And there won't be nearly enough social media support because not enough people on the left are willing to say anything negative about Biden or Democrats. People on the right will of course complain about how the Biden team and Democrats will mess up their ""investigation"", but they won't have any credibility, and they have practically no serious presence on social media.",2021-02-05 03:25:58

A lot of us are hurting right now. They're hurting real bad. It hurts in the meowmeow. 

But we must not get papery hands and drop the ball. All you have to do is hold. Just don't do anything, and if you want to do something else than press that sell button with your hands, use them to rub one out.

BUT

If you absolutely want to do something because you're hurting real real bad because you bought shares when they were at +150USD? 

BUY. SOME. MORE

No, it's not stupid hyped up nonsense memetalk. 

Say you bought 10 shares at 250. That means your Average Share Price is exactly that 250 and your TOTAL SHARE PRICE is 2500USD.

But if you buy ANOTHER 10 shares now at 50 that DOUBLES your total amount of shares to 20 and brings the total Purchase Price of your shares to 3000USD. You have DOUBLE the shares (=double the payout) for only 1/6th of your TOTAL SHARE PRICE. You are dividing hedging your risk more.

Sure, putting in more money seems absurd now, but for a very limited amount of extra cash you can easily DOUBLE, TRIPLE, MOONTUPLE your gains.

Also remember, gainsday might be a long time away, just hold on.

Remember : if you bought 3TC in 2017 and held it until now, you can hold GME till 2023.

But this is part of their plan. Because now these people who are on the edge of selling are going to be itching to get their money back if at all possible.

With that being said, I think the HFs might be looking to create a controlled chaos mini squeeze soon. Jack the price back up to say $300/$350 so that all these people who have lost their life savings on this are almost back to/are back to average.

A lot of these people will sell, allowing the HFs to cover a large number of their shorts. This will then again drop the price, but we will have a lot less people holding.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional and this is not investment advice. I am long GME (216 shares cuz poor) and üíé‚úãing.

This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:

[One DD to Rule Them All](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/)

&#x200B;

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn't been paralleling each other for a week;

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

-Now lets think about how heavily shorted GME was before the things that happened last week.

1) We know GME was shorted like 140% (when it was 10-20$)

2) Right now some say that the percentage of the shorts increased or decreased and we don‚Äôt seem to have any legit data about this.

3) Lots of people say that the shorts have covered their original shorts which were around 5 to 10 dollars and instead have their shorts based on 300 to 400 dollars.

So my question is about the third argument. How can so many people be sure that shorts that were originally underwater were covered? It makes no sense as the HFs who owned these shorts had to buy most of stocks to cover and that alone would have caused the short squeeze to go astronomical. But that didn‚Äôt happen instead it went up just a bit. 

My guess and it is just a thought and not a financial advice. Why wouldn‚Äôt most of HFs be still under water? I think right now what is going on is the HFs are trying to gobble up some stocks from a price point that is as low as possible to cover their original shorts so they dont lose that much money.

I just like the stock and I want you smooth-brains to help me to find an answer about this.

Full disclosure, I own calls (for the 19th of both months) and stonks. Despite strength in the price action, it seems to have a ton of suits rooting against it. Looking on Marketbeat we can see a massive volume of short interest shares. UP 22% on a biweekly period on the closing months of last year alone!

On my platform if I check options pricing, it seems a lot of the pressure is pushing from the top down into the $11 area, which I personally don‚Äôt understand given the success and amount of contracts they have been signing in the past week alone.

"GME isn't short term anymore, it's mid-long term.",53,lckif3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lckif3/gme_isnt_short_term_anymore_its_midlong_term/,24,1612487476.0,"Hello smooth brains

I'm going to break down the GME investors here into two categories.  One group bought GME because the believed the company was going to turn around and they saw long term value like DFV did.  The second group wanted to ride the hype, cash in on easy tendies, then bail.  

While some people in group two may move over to group one, most have and will bail on this stock and that's fine, let them.  Group one however which is likely who is making all the hold posts, will not bail.  DFV lost millions on his current holdings and he as of now has no intention on bailing, he believes in GME and knows it's going places.  Yes he sold some and he was smart for doing so as now he is set for life but he still took a temporary loss on 20+ million because he believes in the company.

Is GME going to moon this week or next?  Probably not, it might just keep dropping until we get another catalyst to turn it around.  If you haven't noticed Gamestop has been very very quit during all of this and I am certain a large part of that is corporate lawyers telling them to keep their mouth shut so if they get accused of stock manipulation there will be nothing to support it.  

Is the dip a bad thing though?  I don't think so, what it's doing is giving us the ability to really get into GME at a great price.  The more it goes down, the further your dollar is going to take you.  simply put 1 share at $150 is 3 shares at $50, making your purchase 3 times more powerful.  You can try to time it out and buy at what you assume it the low point, or you can average down, buying up a few shares every time it drops a decent amount.  

One happy day Cohen is going to announce his plans or some massive deal he made, and that is going to turn the stock green again.  He's not an idiot and hey made his move on GameStop because he knows he can do something big. People like to argue that you can buy games anywhere but it's branding that matters most.  Remember you could buy pet supplies anywhere when he started chewy and look how that turned out.  This time though, he has a powerful brand name already going for him (and a massive amount of free advertisement from us)  Also keep in mind once Wall Street realizes they are not a failing company anymore, they will also start to pile into it.  Lets remember BlackRock owns 9,217,335  shares.  Yes they sold 2 million shares, but they unloaded a small chunk just like DFV did, but  kept the majority of their holdings.  

Overall if you believe in the company keep holding and average down if you can.  I bought in at $20, $21, $25, and $30 so I am averaging up but hey I like the stock.  If you bought in because you wanted easy $$$ and missed out, you just need to decide on what to do yourself.  It's not a short term play anymore and you need to ask yourself if that's something your ok with.

Again it's all perspective and not financial advice.  It's your money (and probably your banks because you borrowed) so you decide what to do.",2021-02-05 03:11:16

GME: Hedge fund insider reporting,2501,lcki4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcki4u/gme_hedge_fund_insider_reporting/,255,1612487456.0,"Edit: this is not financial advice

As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.

First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.

Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.

In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.

This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.

Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves

Short DD on STLA,5,lckg22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lckg22/short_dd_on_stla/,23,1612487312.0,"Hey all, amidst all the GME madness, I‚Äôd like to share a ticker I think could be great in the next few years. It‚Äôs a little EV company called Stellantis (STLA). Stellantis is an EV manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as FCA and Peugeot. It just recently opened for public trading on the market. They plan to have 39 different EVs made by 2022. 

What makes this pick so great in my opinion is, of course, Joe Biden. Not just Biden being there, however. Joe Biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into EVs. What company does the federal government use for the most part? Dodge, *which is owned by FCA*. With Stellantis very likely producing these EVs, we could see a very healthy surge in the company‚Äôs value. 

Pretty short DD, I know, but I think this has the potential to be a great long term pick.

Yes, nothing is a guarantee when it comes to the market but in this particular circumstance you have every reason to buy/hold and only one reason to sell: You‚Äôre WEAK. Am I being crass? No and you need to develop those loss calluses, preferably sooner than later.

If you are unfamiliar this is Coca Cola's first forray into alcoholic beverages since the 80's, in an extremely hot segment, don't believe me? Check your wife's boyfriends pantry, its full of hard seltzers, and pregnancy tests.

Coca Cola, curiously, is vocal about them presenting zero ads themselves during the Superbowl, saying they're ""excited to watch from the sidelines"". This is not common for them to sit out the biggest event of the year.

Meanwhile Molson Coors, which has the exclusive rights to market Topo Chico in the US, has been vocal that they are 'introducing new products with an introductory ad campaign during the super bowl'. 

Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is already available in a few countries, and reviews are generally favorable, but if America is drawn to Topo Chico like an ape is drawn to emojis then we can see a huge lift in KO's stock price with this super bowl ad 'blitz' (haha!! Ha..)

Trolls did well, but let‚Äôs face it, crying kids shouldn‚Äôt be in the theaters in the first place so playing their movies at home is actually a better idea anyway. But THEATER movies? There‚Äôs a reason why the new Bond movie has been finished since last April and delayed until post COVID. They‚Äôd rather sell 4 $20 tickets than 1 $30+ PPV. Hollywood makes most of their $$ from ticket sales, whereas theaters profit from the concessions, but you already knew that. The point is, Hollywood would NEVER let a cash flow like that go out of business and start releasing movies only at home.

Let me ask you an honest question: Anyone else heard about the Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire trio rumored for Spider-Man 3? You think Marvel would EVER release that directly to Disney plus? Have you ever been to any Marvel movie ever in lMAX / Dolby opening night? The energy is UNPRECEDENTED. 

Robert Pattinson‚Äôs Batman, new James Bond, King‚Äôs Man, Pirates of the Caribbean reboot, Ready Player 2... the list goes on. These are, for the most part, THEATER movies.

All logic tells us if there is a shortage of sellers prices will go up, unless of course there are no buys (and come on I'm buying every dip I can afford like the rest), then how on earth would we see a price dip if truly those here are not selling? there are two answers weak paper hands closing on a loss (sorry for your loss) and hedgies doing everything they can to kill the price. Stay strong FAM we will prevail!

Hope to see other chime in with their prospective on what we are seeing today, Its very clear to me but hope to hear others thoughts around volume, movement, and prediction. 

P.S. I am a dipshit, and this is not finical advice!

I previously was never interested in learning stocks. I thought it would be too much time and effort to teach myself. The amount of reading and new information i have absorbed is amazing. 

My shares in GME are just acting as a savings account thats not in bank. (As a student i get basically zero interest in my savings account) 

**TIME TO LET GME MARINATE**

As a full time student and working 25 hours a week i do not have it in me to day trade. This last week my eyes have been glued to the phone. I have not been efficient with my time. 

I am going to use a platform that automatically trades stocks and ETFs. Instead of having money in my savings account not earning interest, i believe having it sit in an investment count will do me right in the years to come.

Today $GME is down as much as it has been during this rally. The hype is not there and that is ok.

Right  now, shorted stocks are the hottest things for retail traders and I'm  sure fund managers have noticed. They know the SEC filing on shorts is  Feb. 9th. That is the ONLY time we will know anything about the funds  short positions during this rally.

I  think, that there will be another rally, leading up to Feb 9th. I  bought in on todays dip, in hopes of the stock shooting up before Feb  9th. The rally may go past feb 9th, depending on the short positions  posted.

**Pre-pandemic:** in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $1.3B.

**Now:** in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $2.5/share, and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $0.12B.

Their revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments), ***they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution***, assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.

Like many, I saw the GME fiasco as a ‚Äúfree money glitch‚Äù. I was uninformed, did little to no research, and immediately poured $700 that I probably couldn‚Äôt afford to lose into GME. When it‚Äôd drop from 300 down to 200, I‚Äôd panic and sell, just trying to get something in return. This happened until the $700 was $189, and I felt like I was the biggest retard known to man. Although I pissed my money away and would‚Äôve been better off wiping my ass with it, we hurt the suits. That‚Äôs bigger than money. I‚Äôm just a broke college student halfway towards a business degree, and this situation could have implications for years to come. 

So far I‚Äôve learned:

- Do your research on the situation before you invest.

- Sometimes the real profit comes from fucking the suits raw. 

- Don‚Äôt panic when it drops, you‚Äôre playing into the suits‚Äô plan, they‚Äôre probably sitting there beating off at the thought of potentially millions of retards like myself throwing their money away.

- You haven‚Äôt lost money until you sell, likewise you haven‚Äôt made money until you sell.

- Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose.

- Feeling depressed after a loss is normal, and you will not profit off of every stock. 

Hopefully this will help some of the newer members like myself who have been considering hopping in. This sub has gained over 5 million new members in the past week. Please do your research, be informed, and do not invest more than you can afford to lose.

""History provides ample evidence for the crucial importance of large-scale cooperation. Victory almost invariably went to those who cooperated better ‚Äì not only in struggles between Homo sapiens and other animals, but also in conflicts between different human groups. Thus Rome conquered Greece not because the Romans had larger brains or better toolmaking techniques, but because they were able to cooperate more effectively.

Throughout history, disciplined armies easily routed disorganised hordes, and unified elites dominated the disorderly masses.

(...)

In order to mount a revolution, numbers are never enough. Revolutions are usually made by small networks of agitators rather than by the masses. If you want to launch a revolution, don‚Äôt ask yourself, ‚ÄòHow many people support my ideas?‚Äô Instead, ask yourself, ‚ÄòHow many of my supporters are capable of effective collaboration?""

 Long time lurker first time poster. This is a post for the baby apes out there and not for our Kongs who have experienced loss. I have never invested over $100 here and there. With this GME explosion I thought itd be a good idea to throw 3 months rent at it that I had saved up. 

2 tips if you do that:

1. Have a month rent saved up at least because you WILL be evicted (oops)

2. Invest only what you‚Äôre ok with losing

I didn‚Äôt follow either step. The bright side is I learned Im a paper hand bitch, I learned to never YOLO and take calculated risk, and most of all I learned that this sub, even with my bad experience recently, is putting up the good fight.

So why do I invest in these meme stocks? Because it gives me **hope**. Hope that I kept losing day by day. Some of you have never had to worry about eating less calories to save money on rent. Some of you never had to worry about not being able to afford the last year of university and losing your future. I‚Äôm sure some of you can relate, whether you went through the same events as me or not. I can go on about the struggles in my life but that is aside the point. The only things that have pushed me throughout all the harsh life were my dreams of a better future for my own family one day. WSB has become a new home that showed me the vast amount of knowledge I can learn to invest **smarter**. There is so much DD among the countless memes that you can pick apart and learn from. Here‚Äôs something I learned, *‚ÄùYou can only lose when you sell.‚Äù My dumbass from the start put in $ never expecting to see it back. That‚Äôs why seeing all this red doesn‚Äôt shake me. This whole movement, other than my dreams, is the only other catalyst in my life to live to a happier, healthier tomorrow. I‚Äôm not fucking selling. This is my home after GME and AMC and **WE‚ÄôRE NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!** 

My autistic ass has never found another home so open to people making ridiculous financial decisions off of a mix of part DD and part meme. I have never found another home so entertaining, yet insightful at the same time. I have never seen the glory of being a *‚Äùwinner‚Äù.* And you know what, I‚Äôm not leaving till I see that day. I‚Äôm not leaving till we take it to the moon again. I‚Äôm not leaving till we take it to the stars. I‚Äôm not leaving till everyone knows we can take it this far. We‚Äôre supercharged and we‚Äôre going to take this thing to Mars. **ALEXA** PLAY ‚ÄúLift Off‚Äù BY KANYE WEST

TLDR: Hadn‚Äôt been for this whole meme stock blowing up, I would have never found such an amazing community that offers so much knowledge to take in. Hadn‚Äôt been for this whole meme stock, I would have slowly let my dreams slipped away. With this meme, I remember dream. I remember goal, I find soul.

Can I see?"" and starts coming for my back door. I'm frantically trying to keep my animals inside and lock the door because a talking ape is cool and all but I don't know if he eats cats. And sliding doors are IMPOSSIBLE to lock. Stupid little thing you're supposed to slide but it jams and doesn't line up right and he's getting closer.

You pretty much buy the cheapest stock you can afford that day, and then wait for it to double or triple or whatever in value until you sell it. Your portfolio ends up in the red all the time, but you just hold your stocks til they rise. Then you make your profits, hopefully before they fall again.

If I follow this on the actual stock market, not really caring what I buy but just buying whatever seems to be in a dip, investing about $100 weekly, and then holding onto them for a while hoping the price will eventually increase, will I make money?

When the hedge funds were cornered and the squeeze was triggered (on both Thursday and the following Tuesday) all retail investors were blocked from buying GME and could only sell. This will inevitably create a crash in price. The moment the price crashed they lifted the limitations. It was black and white what they were doing.

On top of this, right as this event was in full swing a wide range of articles and new channels started promoting how social media has moved on from GME to focus on SLV (Really!??)... nobody was focusing on silver. The price of silver was driven up buy the hedge funds pre market and immediately started declining again while the news continued to emphasis the end of the GME squeeze (which wasnt over, it was blocked from happening) all the while dribbling on about the SLV craze (that didnt exist). Coincidentally the hedge funds involved in the GME situation also happen to profit highly from the SLV hype that was created.

And last but not least, there was (and still is) clear evidence that hedge funds have been continuously trading GME back and forth all week at lower and lower prices to artificially drive down the price and cause retail investors to lose interest in GME (...or essentially give up).

What‚Äôs happening now is theft in broad day light. The hedge funds are acting like the spoiled kid at a park who takes his ball and leaves because hes losing at the game. The moment it wasnt working for the hedge funds the illusion of free market was popped.

Reality is that we retail investors get screwed every day by front running, shorting and HFT. That is the bigger theft. This is just a more visible theft, because Wall St. nearly failed.

Also, they still might fail. I'm still buying GME with my money.

If I lose it, I lose it. But I can buy more shares at this price and I still don't think the shorts covered.",2021-02-05 02:43:28

When you're buying in that high of a volume you can't keep the price low. So if you're selling you're screwing yourself over.

Oh, and to the people saying they lost this months rent or they lost money they would use for their livelihood, you're an idiot. This IS a gamble.  Not was a gamble, because it's still going retards.

GME has the potential to hit the Pros we wanted. Its still there and Ill show you why. Im no financial expert but the game is always going to change. 

PROS:

\-Gamestop has a new board, 

\-Gamestop isnt going bankrupt.

\-Gamestop has made a deal with microsoft on digital sales

\-The people on the board of gamestop are part of a successful company!

\-Its low now, but things are probably going to change by a standard especially with gamestop going into new directions as a buisness.

\-Theres no expiry date

The Cons

\- You sell, you will lose the money you put into it.

\-The stock wont hit the value you hoped it would hit

The Pros here: Hedge funds counted on gme to go out of business but its not, its still in buisness. Im holding because I believe in the community even if people are being toxic, this is my first stock I think Personally right now holding is the best move on the table right this moment. and as it gets low buy up some more.

TLDR- new here, and I just posted that I sold my meme stonks for a loss but I was happy about it in the GME megathread and got instantly downvoted out. Lmfao, mind = opened, everyone is just salty they overspent and were/are too scared to get out, so they are trying to swing the odds back but the masses are already against them, the meme stocks prices are bound to plummet imho

The üí©üëê are gonna be mad when the meme stocks keep crashing, just cause they are overly hopeful for gigantic returns on a stock that was overpaid for cause it was sensationalized and peaking. Fully knowing it was a gamble w/ odds not in my favor it, I was okay if I lost it all or most, so I put ~$400 into the 2 main meme stocks yesterday. I got questioned by several friends, making me feel kinda dumb tbh, and after watching the less truly autist members discuss what was happening overall with the community here (and the market in general) I decided that all the paper hands are 100% right for what they did, and my main message on the GME thread was that I'm HAPPY TO HAVE ENTERED ON MEME STOCKS, EVEN THO I LOST SOME MONEY, BECAUSE I HAD THE WHEREWITHALL TO DROP THE FUCK OUT, SO I CAN EARN REAL MONEY WITH THE REMAINING ~$370. IT ALSO TAUGHT ME THAT IN THE STOCK MARKET, NOT EVEN YOU NEIGHBOR GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT YOU, YOURE EITHER THE CHUM OR THE SHARK.

Since some of you aren't getting this... THIS ENDEAVOR WAS NOT A REAL INVESTMENT ATTEMPT. I knew this was a shot in the dark stock going into it. I knew I could lose it ALL potentially in an hour. The haters saying I emotionally decided on the buy/sell like they are revealing something new is unnecessary, I know and I knew it beforehand. Maybe I didn't state it well enough.... TO ME, THIS WAS A GAMBLE ON PURPOSE, LIKE PUTTING $400 ON A HAND OF POKER. I was playing this specific bet, and this bet alone, on the OFF CHANCE it took off based on the talk I was seeing and hearing throughout the day, but the mood of the social aspect of the economy, to me, seemed like it was a done deal, so I folded. 

My entire point SIMPlified: I started a gamble, I saw it was a likely losing hand and folded before I lost any more. Allowing myself to put this money that, at first I was willing to lose, into a more secure gain. Thus, the GME post-peak hype is lame, but it got me into the market, cause this was some of my extra money anyway so I'm happy

Please think for yourself.,49,lcjsxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcjsxu/please_think_for_yourself/,20,1612485751.0,"I think it is time for me to post something. Everywhere I look there people grasping around for good news and/or conspiracies. I know its hard to see your portfolio drop like this for the first time. This can cause emotional trading and that‚Äôs been proven to never be beneficial. I think its important to take a step back from it all and paint the bigger picture for yourself. Not every bullish theory is true and not every bearish theory is true. Try to distinguish fact from fiction for yourself. The points below are just tips that I think might help you.

1. We don‚Äôt know until the 9th of february if the shorts have been closed. 

The original reason that this stock gained so much popularity was the short interest. As far as we know nothing has changed yet on this part. Even if it has, there is nothing we can do about it but hold and/or buy more. We know for sure that the short float number of 140% was right due to the massive report losses for melvin and the reports. So as long as no 100% factual news is released on short interest. We should just wait.

2. If you believe in GME keep the hype going

As long as there is hype around gme there is a chance for a breakout. If you are stressing about your positions, get engaged in conversation. Try to think about why you decided to buy in the first place. Weigh pros and cons of other people arguments. But don‚Äôt get carried away solely by gme bulls or gme bears. The more people talk about this stock the higher the chance that this is your Willy Wonka ticket to tendie town.

3. Stop looking at your screen 24/7. You are only working yourself up.

It is best to just set alerts for price and notifications for reddit posts if you really want to. Looking at the price every minute is not going to change it. Thinking about gamestop every minute can really swing your opinion in the extremities. By this I mean that you will only believe news from one side of the spectrum. The more you look, the more you stress, the harder it is to think rationally.

4. Making a list with the news around the stock can help.

The news on gamestop has been changing a lot each day. There are many negative and positive posts each with their own arguments. Try not to get carried away by a day with mostly negative or positive news. Rather make a list of all the news so you have an overview. This way you can take a step back from the current opinion.


Personal opinion:
I think that as long as the short interest has staid high there is a chance for another breakout. In my opinion Melvin capital (and other shorters) will try their best to make back their losses. And the only way to do that is by shorting GameStop. All we need to do is keep the hype going. Talk about the stock, repeat your bullish thesis and keep believing.  I know its scary to rely on other people not selling their stock. I think its best to compare it to selling your 10$ lottery ticket for 5$ before the results have been drawn. The only differences is that we actually have a chance of winning. The fact that this has gotten so much more media attention than ‚Äúnormal pumps‚Äù should also be reassuring. 

ps. this is not financial advice. I am just a regular investor who saw the short float and wanted to try his luck. 

I own 27 shares of gamestop at $230. Will buy more if it keeps dropping. Wish the best of luck to you all in the stock market. Trading should be fun.",2021-02-05 02:42:31

My analysis on GME as of today,43,lcjqsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcjqsj/my_analysis_on_gme_as_of_today/,14,1612485610.0,"Hi everyone 
I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible as I know that most of you have the attention span of a clownfish. 

First of all this isn‚Äôt financial advice and should not been taken as such this is only my personal view on the matter and could be completely erroneous. 

For all the new people this is post as discussion and not DD because this isn‚Äôt due diligence I feel like it needs to be said when we can see the amount of rubbish spammed DD to say nothing but ‚ÄúDiamond hand‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not over‚Äù without giving any information of sorts.

I‚Äôve been a lurker of this sub since I‚Äôve created this Reddit account so more or less a year now. I‚Äôve never got much involved on conversation or other as I didn‚Äôt feel like what I had to say would be relevant. I have had my play without giving echoes of it following some DD seen here and crossed with my own research. I‚Äôve joined GME like probably most of this Sub when it went above $20. I‚Äôm still holding tho and that‚Äôs what brings me here today. 

Some of the squeeze might have happened on the 28th when priced went to an all time high of $483. That undeniable. Yes it has been driven by a hype and FOMO worldwide but the amount of short was in my opinion too high to trigger only this much (again with the data given at the time). Drive went down drastically but went back up again over $300 might have been some covering from shorts but again no new enough data to support this fully. 

So yes lots of people probably sold and yes HF might have covered but according to last days it seems that they are pushing hard to drive the price down. The next available data for shorts will only be available on 9th Feb and it probably give them enough time to drive the price further down and shake as many paper hands of too cover at the price they need. 

Think about it this way Yesterday GameStop had a huge announcement with recruiting people that used to work for the biggest e-commerce firm and price barely soared 2%. Yes in normal time when a stock isn‚Äôt on everyone watch because it‚Äôs not short that much announcement like this for any company would drive the price like this but for the most watched company of all times with the biggest short interest. That seems odd. And my opinion is that they tried the hardest to keep the price down all day and carry on today with lots of paper hands shaking. 

My personal belief is that undeniably lots of people sold and who could blame them ? Yes having diamonds hands is great but it doesn‚Äôt do it all. I myself put what I could ‚Äúafford‚Äù to lose at first buying 31 shares for more or less $1200 got 10 at $35 another 10 at $41 and 11 at $37. 
I‚Äôve sold them some around peak to cover my initial investment and took some profit to double down on an eventual dip which bring me again to the same amount of 31 shares holding today with saving my initial investment (I got to think of my family first and cannot really afford to loose this amount. Now what‚Äôs in my play is money I can loose as it is only unrealised gains.


One last thing do not blame people for becoming paper hands it‚Äôs a tough game and it‚Äôs being played against the toughest people of WallStreet. These people or used to never loose and they will do whatever it takes to fuck everyone to get out of this keeping their reputation for customers and most of their money. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

TLDR : Some short been squoze but most mine remain in and they are gonna carry on driving price down trying to cover if enough paper hands until report for 31Jan come out on 9th Feb.

I sold half and left 130 shares in it. 

I had to wait until 2021! To see 15 again. And I sold at 16. It felt good to be free of it. But it kept on climbing and I lost out on the recent peak.

My question is if the hedge funds are so screwed and everyone is holding (mostly everyone anyways) why does the price keep falling? Is it the short ladder attacks? Is their end goal to get GME down to like $10 and then buy all their shorted shares? It‚Äôs all a little confusing to me.

Tilray¬Æ Exports First Shipment of Medical Cannabis to Spain,20,lcjpdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcjpdu/tilray_exports_first_shipment_of_medical_cannabis/,15,1612485507.0,"# Tilray has become the largest licensed cannabis producer in the world after its recent merger with Aphria.

* The company was also selected by the French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified medical cannabis products in France last week.
* Yesterday, it was announced that Tilray would become the first and only licensed cannabis distributor in Portgual.
* Tilray‚Äôs EU campus is well positioned to capitalize on the demand trend in the EU and in other international markets and we will monitor how quarterly numbers reflect the increasing demand on a going forward basis.  
* Tilray and Aphria as a combined have the largest stake in Canadian cannabis market, and are ready to expand sales into the U.S once legalization continues.
* $TLRY is up **37%** in the past week, with an acquisition and full stock merger with $APHA inbound. 

As U.S federal legalization inches closer each day, TLRY seems to only be gaining momentum.  With a **25.74%** short interest, it may also be a contender for an upcoming short squeeze, similar to the one in 2018.",2021-02-05 02:38:27

I believe in the stock, and I believe in all of you holding it, but there were a few key things at play here that screwed us over.

Our brokers: the brokerages limited buying activity just as GME was gearing up for takeoff. This killed all momentum on the stock.

The media: claimed WSB was abandoning GME and gearing up for SLV. Also reported that Melvin had sold their shares. This created doubt almost immediately, especially amongst the newbies.

The bots/shills: came in droves over The Weekend to spread FUD and misinformation. combine this with the media campaign I wrote above and it's the perfect recipe for fear and uncertainty.

The famous people: screeching from the rooftop their support for the average retail investor when the stock was on the run-up, and then deafening silence when the manipulation was at play. Their silence further caused fear, uncertainty and aided in the momentum's downfall.

The SEC: coming after the average retail investor and investigating DFV, a regular analyst that did nothing wrong except share his views on why he liked Gamestop. He was shit on by all of WSB for months until the stock started taking off due to Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry, etc, and everyone wanted to jump on board due to FOMO. But no, clearly he must have done something finicky to cause the stock to rise. No way it could have been the hedge funds shorting twice the amount of shares outstanding, am I right?

And finally, ourselves: This turned into a cult, really quickly. It reeks of desperation in this subreddit (myself included). It sounds like an echo chamber in here where we all are repeating the same shit we hear from people much smarter than us, ""shorts covering today due to expired calls!"", ""T+2"" ""short ladder attacks, everyday!"", ""low volume!"", ""Failure to deliver so squeeze in 13 days!"", etc etc.

We abandoned critical thinking when we needed it most. The moment we lost the hype, we needed to explain to everyone that hopped on board the GME train, just why it was still a good investment with great potential. But we didn't. We attacked anyone with doubts or thinking of selling by downvoting and calling them shills/bots. And we kept repeating the same exact things, but when we people asked why this was all happening, it was nothing but silence. We let ourselves down. I'm not saying it's going to be impossible to recover what we've lost, but without some serious support from a large catalyst, there's not much to hold on to.

For these reasons, I'm out. Keep fighting the good fight, everyone, but it looks like this stock won't recover for years. I believe in Ryan Cohen and hope to see great things, but the value isn't there yet for me and many others to bag hold at this time. As always, I'm no financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Buy or sell, it's all up to you. I'm going to go back to sniffing glue and looking at the pretty green and red (mostly red) colors on my charts",2021-02-05 02:36:52
I love losing money,37,lcjnzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcjnzo/i_love_losing_money/,6,1612485410.0,"When I initially invested into GME I was just a fledgling autist trying to make a quick buck. As it went up along with my P/L I began to get less and less satisfaction from my gains. I was up 100% then 200% then even more but it was never enough. Then Robinhood came in and all hell broke loose and all of a sudden the stock started to plummet. 350, 300, 200, 150, 112. As I watched my account going down and getting my first taste of glorious loss porn, I felt something. Pure autistic euphoria. God damn why does it feel so fucking good? Is this retard? I'm never selling this stock. It is a source infinite joy. My entire investment is well worth this feeling alone. I feel alive. I walk around the city with a huge diamond cock in my pants and the people around me can feel it in the air. I'm a changed man, it's like I'm finally rid of the burden of caring about money. I'm so free, like an ape, swinging from tree to tree in search of banana.

Now you have probably already responded with a reactanc bais doing the exact opposite of what we're told, especially when we perceive threats to personal freedoms. Like how you spend your money. Listen up! 

&nbsp;

You came to WSB because of what is known as a Bandwagon effect the tendency of an individual to acquire a particular style, behaviour or attitude because everyone else is doing it. It is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion of others who have already done so because you saw it on the front page of reddit with a thousand likes and what not. 

&nbsp;

Confirmation bias is a thing it's a tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with one's own  existing beliefs and that's why you all on here WSB checking each other out. 

&nbsp;

WSB is a echochamber or rather the better word it confirmed to Groupthink which is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.

&nbsp;

Some of you will disagree with me at this point due to what is known as in-group preference, is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. So go ahead and agree with each other in the comments section below. Just know that false consensus is also a thing.

There is a reason why they call you Retard it because you are mentally slow to understand that you had to cash out last week.

GME Reasons why I think holding is the only rational choice at this point,33,ld2qzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld2qzz/gme_reasons_why_i_think_holding_is_the_only/,14,1612541891.0,"Based on my interpretation of this [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/)

In short, there are two scenarios:

A) Short interest is legitimately declining as retail investors lost their discipline and sold, allowing the hedge funds to cover their shorts and confirm the mainstream media narrative. 

B) Critical mass of squeezers didn't sell and the short interest only looks like it's falling because the hedge funds are playing some extremely dirty tricks to manipulate the numbers, which they have a documented history of doing. The media loves Wall St and they don't know any better so they report that the squeeze is over based on the falling stock price even though it's not.

That said, retail investors either did the smart thing and only invested what they were willing to lose (so if you sell now you'll just cement your loss if you bought in when it was high or kneecap your gains if you bought in when it was low) or they did the bold thing and went all in on this (so you have nothing left to lose and everything to gain). It isn't certain that we are in scenario A but selling now would only make it a certainty. Based on low volume, the likelihood is high that we are in scenario B and the numbers we've been seeing are all just big market manipulation by the hedge funds which we've been seeing all week (plus a bunch of people losing faith and selling aka falling prey to the media narrative). In the unlikely event we are in A, investors have all already put in what they're willing to lose, holding loses nothing more, so if the hedge funds break the squeeze it's no skin off investors' backs (unless you went all in, god bless you folks).

So the way I see it, the only choices are hold and wait for the value to go back up (inevitable if we're in B), or sell and solidify your loss (and thereby ensure A). As long as critical mass holds, the hedge funds still have no choice but to buy from investors so it's just a waiting game to see when they'll stop fighting the inevitable and stop trying to manipulate the markets even more by scaring people into selling with ignorant media coverage and shill posts.

But I could be wrong. This is all just my observation and opinion, not advice. I'm just explaining my reasoning for continuing to hold. In my mind it's money I've essentially spent so if it becomes worthless, I already don't care. But if the stock goes up, that'd be pretty damn awesome.",2021-02-05 18:18:11

This is not financial advice.
There's been so many disinfo and myths and I just wanna share my thought for discussion. This is from another retail trader and i'm merely translating his words into English and post it here.

Author position: Diamond hands 325@213.0934

Myth 1. Has the SS been squoze on Jan26 when prices hit 450+?

NO. Critical indicators of shorts covering are: Hiking turnover rates, prices, and volume. I mean, look at the fucking volume. The trading volume on 26th was significantly lower than that of the previous 3 trading days (21st, 22nd, and 25th). Lowering turnover rates and prices since 26th further prompted that people are not selling shit, but shorties continue to short the hell out of it; Therefore, I suspect the current SI% could be even higher than 226% (SI% on Jan 15). 



Myth 2. Can shorties hedge their positions by longing call options?

NO. ITM call options would cause market makers to hedge their positions by purchasing the underlying share which results in price uplift (Gamma squeeze). This is what WE want shorties to do but they just won‚Äôt do it. 


Myth 3. Can shorties cover their shorts trading back and forth?

NO. If we don‚Äôt sell, they are not covering shit. They initiate short ladder attacks trying to demolish our heuristics and throw our shares away. The true value that they have to pay for their absurdity is nowhere near the current market price. This is the chance when WE get to set the price by limiting supply, not THEM. 


Myth 4.  Omg the current price is so low; Shorties are covering their shorts at low costs!!

NO. Same logic, they are trying to fool us on the fair value by countless shitty price offerings with new shorts (short ladder) and counterfeited shares. It‚Äôs simple af, we don‚Äôt sell at bad prices. We get to set the price when they are forced to buy to cover their shorts. THEY ARE NOT COVERING ANY SHIT IF WE DON‚ÄôT FUCKING SELL.


TLDR: They are NOT covering shit. The current price is a joke. Short Squeeze will happen if we don‚Äôt sell.üíéüñêüèªüöÄüåï",2021-02-05 17:50:56

A different user name on Youtube and Reddit were used to help spread the falsities of common consensus. Mere weeks after horrible earnings, the stock tanking to near single digits and more store closures there was suddenly momentum. A generation of people that make the majority of purchases online and go to forums/chat-rooms to socialize, had finally accrued enough mob mentality to think a narrow focused brick and mortar store was worth something. The generation that spent a decade mocking boomers was now furiously climbing over each-other to support a boomer built business, convinced it was worth more than world-changing businesses like Google, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, and life saving pharmaceuticals.

THINK BACK TO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN MARK CUBAN DID AN AMA. HE SAID

IF NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO SO. FUCKING HOLD

ASK YOURSELF THEN WHAT CHANGED?

THERE IS NO NEW INFORMATION WHETHER THEY COVERED OR NOT. SO IN WHO‚ÄôS INTEREST IS IT TO GET YOU TO SELL RIGHT NOW? YOU THINK SOME RANDOM PRIMATE ON REDDIT IS SUDDENLY LOOKING OUT FOR YOU AND WANTS YOU TO MAKE FINANCIALLY SOUND DECISIONS? THIS ROTTEN SHIT HOLE IS NOT /R/STOCKS ITS FUCKING WALL. STREET. BETS.

IT‚ÄôS IN THEIR INTEREST TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE AS LOW AS IT CAN GO.

SO THEY CAN SLOWLY BUY IT BACK UP A LITTLE AT A TIME AND MINIMIZE THEIR COLOSSAL LOSSES BIGGER THAN THEIR WIFES DILDO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUE RETARDS WHO GOT SO GREEDY, A WEEK AGO THEY WERE ON THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY. AND NOW THEY ARE PULLING EVERY DIRTY TRICK IN THE BOOK TO GET YOU TO SELL AND CRASH THE PRICE LOWER AND LOWER.

THE PUSH TO $500 LAST THURSDAY WAS NOT THE SQUEEZE.

HOW DO I KNOW THIS? I DON‚ÄôT KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE I FOMOED INTO THIS STOCK BECAUSE I READ AT A 3RD GRADE LEVEL AND I FAILED ALGEBRA AND NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN THE PRICE HIT $500 I KNOW THAT ROBINHOOD REMOVED THE BUY BUTTON TO GET YOU TO STOP BUYING. THEY CRIED FOR MORE REGULATION ON TV. THEY PAID FOR ADS ON CNBC TO GET YOU THINKING THEY COVERED. THEY PURCHASED ADS ON REDDIT TO GET YOU TO BUY SILVER AND DIFFERENT STOCKS. THEY PURCHASED BOTS TO OVERRUN THIS PLACE AND QUESTION WHY YOU BOUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACEE.

How is that so difficult to understand? If you‚Äôre taking out your mortgages, loans, and life savings and dumping it in this, you‚Äôre a fucking idiot. Don‚Äôt ever make this mistake ever again. You‚Äôre risking a lot, that you cannot afford to risk. Think about it twice, thrice, multiple times before diving in. This is not a for sure thing. Nobody fucking knows what‚Äôs going to happen. So please, for the love of god, do not bet with money you cannot afford to lose. It‚Äôs not worth it. It never will be. 

With that said, all of you holding, please keep holding. It‚Äôs been a rough ride, and it probably will be until Tuesday. Keep holding, because if you sell now, you‚Äôre going to be selling at a SIGNIFICANT LOSS. What‚Äôs the point in selling now if you could just wait 2 days, Friday and Monday, and probably not make much of a difference in your losses but you could potentially find your way to the squeeze, in case it happens. 

I still have a small amount of faith in this. But we need to have faith in each other. We need to be strong together. I know it sounds ridiculous but the big men in suits were counting on us to lose morale and start fighting with each other. This is how we start to fuck things up. This is exactly what they want. 

Lastly, if you sold because your losses were too high, it‚Äôs understandable. And we still respect you for sticking it out for this long. But please stop harassing people for holding. Why are you mad people still believe in this? It‚Äôs their fucking money. Not yours. Stop being dickwads and just support those still holding. You‚Äôre not losing anything by just not fucking bullying them. 

I think we might be able to do this. But we need to stop losing morale and toughen up a little. It sucks, a lot. It hurts. But, we need to stop turning on each other. There is no point, and neither of the two parties gain anything by turning on each other. Paper hands, diamond hands are not your enemies. Diamond hands, paper hands are not your enemies.

They also offer far more than games. Take a spin through their website. They sell TVs, speakers, headphones, iPads, toys, smart home devices, fucking hoverboards! Next time you consider buying an electronic, check to see if Gamestop carries it before defaulting to Amazon. And encourage others to do the same.

They have all the right pieces intact to make a big push into e-commerce. Ryan Cohen saw that and felt strongly enough to put up a huge stake. Now we're already seeing the leadership get packed with rock stars like Matt Francis. But it's going to take us, the consumers, to make them successful. If we translate a fraction of the enthusiasm we showed over the stock frenzy into rampant consumption of their goods, we can collectively have a big impact on their growth.

After silver randomly accounts we‚Äôve never seen start saying buy at this-x-time! On the same day as that SEC announced looking at WSB for pump-in-dump

Agreed,24,lczsc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczsc9/agreed/,17,1612529631.0,"Failure-to-deliver

I've been looking into this a lot over this last week. I'm not sure who here understands this... however I believe that the wallstreetbets crew has exposed the biggest rip off in securities history. 

We know last week on Friday, the reported SI% was 121%. At the end of that week... Thursday and Friday was the first time in history that people were restricted from only buying a share. I believe RH when they say the clearing house had a liquidity issue... however from what I've found... the clearing house or money manager only has to reconcile the financial transaction, and not the actual shares being exchanged. 

When a short expires, the person or entity in that provision has t+3 (I've also seen t+6) to cover that position. A traditional retail investor is going to see that as of Friday... there was a 121% SI, meaning that the public float strongly supported a short or gamma squeeze due to the demand to buy. 

Here is what I don't understand... 

There is no ramifications for a hedge fund to actually deliver any of those shares except a small fine relative to the capital these hedge funds have. What is to stop any hedge fund in this example... or any future example... to not deliver the shares that are already owed, as well as continue to borrow more shares that don't exist? 

The hedge funds could essentially short the market at the peak, especially with the reassurance that buying has been restricted... and systemically drive the share price down within the alloted cover time (t+3 or t+6)?

Not only do they give themselves time to drive the share price down (essentially reducing their cover expense), but also profit on the short position as the share price tumbles. The retail investor is operating on confidence that the supply and demand fundamentals of economics is on their side. However when you look closer..  that is all a facade. Supply and demand is fake. 

There is no safe guard to the retail investor in this example. There is no penalty that is strong enough to prevent a hedge fund from over extending any short position in the future. All you need is a lot of capital and a highly volatile stock which conditions the money manager to allow an exceptionally high failure-to-deliver ratio. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong because if I'm right... this isn't a free and fair market at all. Especially since hedge funds have very little regulations compared to other entities associated with securities.

I'm reading about this coup that took place over a dumb movie/film thing and I can't help but feel bad for the real OGs of this subreddit. Idk I'm kind of ranting here but this GME Rebellion for the most part has been something positive for the average person, it brought me here afterall and got me thinking more about how I should be more involved with investing in general. 

The greed that's on display now, coupled with the shitty ass rigged wallstreet game to fuck the entire movement is disheartening. Again, i don't have much room to speak in this group but myself here, but this shit pisses me off, and unintended consequences are drawing folks that are only here to seek profit at the expense of the integrity of r/Wallstreetbets 

I have absolutely nothing to gain financially by participating, its a gamble but its not about the money to me. You all made these fuckers afraid of the common man and that's what the real gain from this is. I'd be very sad to see folks get demoralized and give up, especially due to internal scumbags trying to take advantage of the situation that never gave 2 shits until it became famous.

"Founder of TesTOP, Elon",0,lczs0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczs0a/founder_of_testop_elon/,1,1612529594.0,"Just my thought. I doubt Elon is interested in this topic, and if he ever reads this, but I hope he at least considers engaging with GME although as it is very risky for him to take as his position at Tesla, but I think this aligns with his motto, for the people and future!

Some made big bucks or lost arms and legs from GME, but lets keep in mind that we love(d) GameStop once. 

GME's fundamental is now enhanced with the new Chief of Technology from Amazon specializing in AWS and is more promising than ever before to bring greater business model expanind it to online market. GME party is over though, this frenzy(?) is now recorded in history and will be taught for our future generations. But what will be the lesson for future generation? Think of what we were trying to achieve and why does it have to end? Here it is my idea how it should continue.

Tesla also went through the short attack and Wallstreet never granted its success until proven. Where does Tesla stand now? Put it aside, am I the only one if Tesla purchase GameStop and its synergy can upgrade to another level? Tesla needs to increase more sales and GameStop has offline stores and its customers including those who fought against short sellers. They  eventually will be an owner of Tesla car. Who would mind a Tesla car with all features, like entertainment system, gaming, watching movies, real time video call, and virtual reality system, and so on? Combine GameStop and Tesla,  wow lets call it TeStop(Tesla+GameStop) simply. Starlink can work with those TeStop offline stores as basestation for high speed internet(5G, 6G, or whatever), charging station, and shopping stores, and SpaceX or Boring ticket office to another side of earth and even to the moon. You name it and anything is possible. Its only a matter of who can make it happen. A person found a company but who develop it? Its people like us. Now people is one of the most powerful company's fundemental that makes a company successful. And GameStop is the one. As always, any risk to one can be a perfect opportunity to another.

These posts did an excellent job of saying why GME was a undervalue play and why people should buy into it. One of the biggest reasons was the long term play + the short squeeze and all these DD posts had a realistic price of around 100-300. More and more people like me got in early November/December before there earnings and we held, even though our portfolio was down 50% percent.  We were looking for the Q1 2021 earning's report for something to happen regarding the stock price.  

Most of us were measured, only invested what we could loose, never formed a group or called any one else out when they did not believe in us. We knew the risks involved and still held it.  

After the influx of all the new ü¶ç the entire narration was changed. Every one who bought till 300-350 could have made money when the sold at the orginal meme price of $420.69

Suddenly people who never invested before, who have no trade experience, who never lost anything came up with stupid ass DD like comparing with VW chart and came up with price target of $1000+ to Infinity and worst some conspiracy level shit.

There are lots of reasons to think it will soar, or at minimum return to all time highs in the next couple weeks:

- Earnings is 14 days away I expect a run up to earnings.  They are holding an ""investor day"" in conjunction with their earnings so you know they have something good to share.

- Holiday sales - I'm certain walmart killed it during the holidays, people can't spend on vacations so they are holding cash and everyone went into the holidays knowing their $600 stimulus was coming.

- Walmart+ -  Walmart+ is already estimated to be in 10% of households and is growing fast - you can say its priced in but I think the free same-day delivery is a real differentiator for them.  I also anticipate more benefits to be added to Walmart+ to help them compete with Amazon Prime benefits.

My play: WMT 145c 4/16

Easy tendies just riding the run up to earnings and cashing in prior to earnings. Im BUYING RIGHT NOW while volatility is low and premiums are inexpensive.  If you're autistic enough, hold some contracts through earnings - investor day is a wildcard, I expect big news...if I had to guess what we might hear: Walmart+ news, buy backs, dividend increase, improved labor costs (they are relying robots in back of house more and more).",2021-02-05 14:50:54

Yeah, me too. However, the squeeze either (1) is over or (2) won‚Äôt happen. Short interest is way down, and what short interest there is is already profitable, way profitable.

GME is down 88% in a week. If I told you this stock that just lost 90% of its value was a great buy, you‚Äôd laugh at me. So, what to do if you actually like the stock? Well, here‚Äôs some simple math:

Ron the Retard gambled his $1,200 rent money on 4 shares of GME @$300. His portfolio is now worth $200, a loss of 86%. However, he still has $200 worth of stock. If Ron uses his one brain wrinkle and sells now, he has $200 in buying power. Let‚Äôs say GME goes down to only a 400% gain in one year, at $20. Ron, then buys $200 worth of GME, because he really likes the stock.

Same $200, but one leaves you with 4 shares worth $80. The other leaves you with 10 shares worth $200.

Then, let‚Äôs say Ryan Cohen does the unthinkable - GME goes up another 400% in 2021 and this time next year it‚Äôs worth $80. Would you rather have 4 shares, cause you used your üíé üôå? Or 10 shares because you weren‚Äôt an idiot?

4x80=$320 10x80= $800

Let‚Äôs think about this another way. You have your$1,200 rent money, and some dude steals $1,000. Do you hand him the other $200? Fuck no.

Lastly, if you really think the squeeze will happen on GME eventually, why not hold 10 shares instead of 4? Wouldn‚Äôt that hurt the man more.

GME Endgame - A Final Hope,161,lczmk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczmk7/gme_endgame_a_final_hope/,25,1612529029.0,"**State of Affairs**

This week has been a rough one - portfolios blown up, dreams dashed, losses grudgingly taken. Lessons learned, ""I told you so‚Äôs"" said, confusion abounding. Some people are on the fence about getting out at pennies on the dollar; some plan to die with their withered fingers clutching their heavily devalued shares. Both of these groups are looking for some hopium, and I hope to provide that in this post with some actual information rather than the garbage I am seeing spammed all over this sub. My account is 8 years old and I haven't posted anything in 4 1/2, but I've been a longtime lurker of WSB and became enamored with the GME story back in November so I have digested about every morsel posted here since then. I am not an investing expert in any way, just doing this for fun. Shoutout to /u/FatAspirations for his great posts that really got me in this thing deep.

**The Fall**

We all know what happened here so I won't spend a lot of time on it, but GME is down 87% over the past week. I know everyone has noticed the stark contrast between the exuberant mood of 1/27 - 1/29 and the stomach churning disappointment of 2/1 - 2/4. Uncertainty about Gamestop is at an all time high, with people comparing different numbers as of different dates from different sources with no clear picture of what is true. This combined with an influx of new users, infiltration by bots and shills, and a struggle for control of the subreddit has left this place in complete disarray. Very few people overall and no one here can really say definitively why Gamestop took the plunge this week, but there are certainly no shortage of theories: hedge funds closed their shorts on the way up, hedge funds struck a deal behind closed doors, people paperhanded on the way down, etc. I am here to provide an alternate view of what happened that I've seen whispers of but not fully fleshed out.

**The Theory**

It has been widely publicized that short interest in Gamestop declined sharply sometime in the last week. Ortex's reported short interest declined from 51M on 1/27 to 39M on 1/28 to 29M on 1/29. S3 partners issued a drastic correction to their estimated short interest over the weekend, reporting a reduction from ~58M shares as of Friday 1/29 to ~27M as of Monday 2/1. This led the company, previously championed on WSB, to be denounced as being bought by The Man...I am not so sure of that. I propose that while the estimated short interest has declined, there is a technical reason behind it.

This leads me to the crux of my theory...read [this article](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) before continuing. I know many of you can't read, so have your wife's boyfriend read it to you for whatever it costs...

Didn't read it? Fine, I'll summarize. A hedge fund that is short a stock and facing a squeeze can write (sell) far OTM call options on a stock to a market maker. When the market maker purchases these options, the market maker has a legal obligation to remain delta neutral by essentially ""naked shorting"" the stock. This produces a wave of the ""synthetic long shares"" that anyone following the Gamestop story has heard a lot about. The hedge fund selling the far OTM call options then buys these synthetic long shares that were created by the market maker. The hedge fund can then report that they ""bought back"" their original short position via buying long shares, even though they really haven't; the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call options they initiated because of the hedging of the market maker! By using this maneuver, hedge funds are able to report reduced short interest, but the short interest hasn't really changed.

Take a minute, read this a couple times, digest it.

**The Evidence**

I read a post the other day (forgot from who, sorry) that brought up unusual activity on the options chain for 2/5 $800 calls. I can't remember for sure what it was on Monday-Tuesday, but EOD Wednesday the open interest on $800 calls was 24k, with 16k more volume today (note that the 16k isn't fully added to the 24k, it can be the same option being traded back and forth). I haven't looked at the option chain a ton, but I do know that is pretty heavy volume.

Per MarketBeat, as of 1/15/20 the outstanding shares (including synthetic) was 102M. I am not sure if there is a reliable source that updates daily, but we know there are lots of synthetics out there because of the original shorting.

**An Outstanding Question**

The theory described above is on its face neutral; market makers create the synthetic long shares to remain delta neutral against the OTM calls that the hedge funds sold them, and the hedge funds buy shares to cover them. While the market makers undoubtedly are creating the synthetic longs, is it possible that the hedge funds actually **aren't** buying the shares to cover them? That the simple transaction of selling the call is enough to falsely reduce short interest? This I do not know. If the hedge funds didn't buy those shares, then the market makers ""naked shorting"" could be a large contributor to the drop in price over the past few days.

**Conclusion**

This could be the last gasp of a man that rose and fell with the Gamestop tsunami and is now taking one last shot at greatness before packing it in and moving on - I hope this post gives you that shot in your mind for at least one more day. What I will say is that despite the state of this subreddit, it can get better if everyone can show a little more empathy for others' situations. Some people are here to make money and read investing ideas: good. Some people want to use Gamestop as a launching pad for reforming Wall Street: good. Some people just love to meme and haven't even bought in: good. What isn't good is when you make low effort shitposts with rockets and diamonds and nothing of substance; I think all the aforementioned groups wouldn't mind these people leaving. Despite the language being stunning to an outsider, WSB had a culture that worked for them and new people visiting the subreddit need to understand what it was and why it was precious. The culture may evolve a bit going forward but let's get more of what made this place great: Insane YOLOs, unique loss porn, and the occasional DD that made you feel like you discovered electricity for the first time.

One thing that will be interesting to watch tomorrow:

GME was on the NYSE Short Sale Restricted List (SSR, no not the USSR) earlier this week. This gets automatically triggered if the stock price drops more than 10% in a day. It basically enforces the Uptick Rule, which says you can only short on an upswing.

Coincidentally, yesterday (2/3) was the only day since last Thursday that the price has gone up even slightly.

Both companies are back on it as of this evening until 2/8. This means the price may go back up tomorrow. If so, my smooth brain opinion is that the huge downswing we‚Äôve been seeing this week has been massive shorts being reopened. Maybe the NYSE short data being released on 2/9 will tell us something interesting. Only time will tell at this point.

Yes, you can wait till 9th for new info. However, you need to understand that the snap shot only includes info for up to last Friday, January 29th. This week was super volatile, and I mean come on, look at the price. It dropped from 200 to 50 in a matter of days. Do you really hedge funds are going to sit around and not make money?

**""Average down""**

People who are telling others to average down, but for what? People average down when the stock has the potential to go back up. However, the sentiment for Game Stop right now is obvious, and it is clearly not positive. Why average down when it keeps going down? If do you want to DCA, at least do so at where the stock was previously at before it got squeezed. I do believe this company can turn itself around under new leadership.

**Should I sell?**

Take what Mark had said for example. The whole context of his tweet was that, if you can afford to hold and see value in this company, then hold. However, at Game Stop's current valuation, they are not worth anywhere near where the price is at now. For those who bought in over 200 like myself, do you really think it's going to go anywhere near that price in the short term? Last quarter they had net sales of what, 1bill?

**My thoughts**

If you really want to hold and can afford to do so, by all means do it. Please stop asking others to hold with you because you think it's going to moon. The dd is there, and the truth is, we got fucked out of a squeeze -- one that is bigger than any that we've seen in history. That opportunity was taken from us last Thursday.",2021-02-05 14:42:54
GME: What Today's Data Shows,26,lczltc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczltc/gme_what_todays_data_shows/,14,1612528953.0,"I'm back again with the position-cost distribution update and an explanation for what I think happened today (you can see my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1m7d/gme_looking_at_some_data/)). For folks who don't know what position cost distribution is, here's Webull's explanation:

[Source: Webull](https://preview.redd.it/qx9md4y29lf61.jpg?width=1061&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96992bc619e57e8d584c8faee5b3c71dee56bdb8)

Since today's price was around the most historically crowded points on the chart, the scale of the X-axis wasn't aligning with yesterday's chart anymore. Webull doesn't show the unit on the axis so I manually aligned the two charts from yesterday and today (by eyeballing):

[2\/3 - 2\/4](https://i.redd.it/0jllnuez8lf61.gif)

Assuming that my alignment is correct and I'm reading this chart correctly, the pattern seems to be consistent with previous days: A massive number of shares have been added to the float again!

Putting the first chart I saved from 2/1 next to 2/4 and aligning them again I got:

[2\/1 - 2\/4](https://i.redd.it/md6drdm09lf61.gif)

My conclusion is that some folks have been adding a shit ton of GME shares to the float this week by shorting the shit out of GME! What is important to me here is that I don't see any evidence of a big sell-off on these charts!

After looking at GME's option chain again, I noticed that hundreds of thousands of put options (\~2m options, or 200m shares) were purchased in the last few days, a lot of which will expire in the next 3 weeks. So the short sellers are probably the market makers who are hedging the put options that they sold and also sell the previous shares they bought to hedge their calls (i.e. reverse gamma squeeze!). I doubt that folks who have bought these options are planning to exercise them (200m of GME shares don't exist!) so the writers of these calls might have to cover their short positions once these options expire in or out of money! My guess is that on top of this many of the shorts tried to cover before Feb 1st so that the next official short interest data shows a reduction (that's probably why they also bombarded these three weeks with put options), now they are using all of that again to short GME and make back the money. As if magically total shares of GME will increase (don't get me started on S3's moronic ""synthetic shares"" nonsense: ""If I borrow your banana, there are two bananas"" is the kind of logic even a ü¶ß don't buy!)!

My plan is to wait until the dip stops dipping (I mean they will run out of shares to short at some point, right?) and buy more shares! I think buying GME on margin is a horrible idea (some folks figured it out the hard way this week) so I'll keep buying on my cash account! I mean at lower than $50 a share, I think this is easily a value play again ( [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com) ).

**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares and a few GME call options**

It‚Äôs time to formulate an elite KONG team that creates/updates one massive thread supporting the mission.,16,lcziv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcziv8/its_time_to_formulate_an_elite_kong_team_that/,8,1612528643.0,"There needs to be an elite team of individuals all working around the clock to update one singular post that remains forefront to the page.  

The mods need to assign (if not themselves) a group of fucking kongs that know their shit inside and out and can post/edit information that no person can possibly doubt.

The post needs to center around one objective:  

The second wave.


The nature of the post should give everyone everything they need to fully understand what is going on, why and what needs to happen.  Most importantly,  legit information that supports this theory of a second wave without tripping anything that could be seen as illegal.

It‚Äôs a thread supporting a theory, not advice, not what to do, not what we should do.  Simply supporting the theory of a second wave.

Having a post that is constantly updated with a time stamp update in the subject helps remove doubt and the spread of mis/disinformation.   Proving/explaining things such as ladder attacks and theoretical solutions for it let alone creative solutions that the community talks about but only sees it for a few hours (and is 100% legit) get added.  The community is encouraged to send vital information only that is scrubbed for legitimacy.  Finally, it needs to be organized and it needs to provide information to help understand other complex information.  Most importantly, the greatest service this post can offer is when it‚Äôs time to call it.  This does a great service to everyone late and uninformed and those that need to salvage what they can.  This is how you fix things.

HOWEVER,  before this,  the first thing that needs to be resolved is the integrity of the mods. If we cant resolve this, chaos will ensue.  


I know we‚Äôre all retarded apes, but I see the kongs here trying to shed light on the situation and their post goes away 7-8 hours later.  Information is all over the place and our biggest problem is disorganization.  The mod take over is in part to blame.


I don‚Äôt know what needs to be done to make this happen, but if you know a mod (or are the mod) with the ultimate authority,  message them this idea to asap find the elite kong squad needed to accomplish this.

The Kong team will need to be okay with proving to the community you are legit.  Either the mod does it for them or them themselves.  We need to know 140% they are with us.  Lastly, for starters, the team should be composed roughly of:

Financial analyst(s)

Lawyers (in finance & investments)

Administration to organize the post and keep it current.

Mods overseeing the project that is beloved and can vouch with their life for those researching and updating the post.

The people who are shorting the stocks right now are waiting for us to budge. They are losing money through their ladder attacks (or whatever the fuck they are doing). They are trying to feel us out on when we will sell. They are seeing if we will sell for a big loss and tomorrow they will see if we will sell for a small gain. Every day after that they will start to realize that we won‚Äôt sell for anything other than what our hearts desire. That will lead them to the point where they accept defeat.

Advice* From A CPA (Not Actual Advice),30,lczhbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczhbv/advice_from_a_cpa_not_actual_advice/,8,1612528485.0,"I debated posting in here (first time posting), but a post earlier about not betting with money you can't afford to lose made me decide to post and I thought maybe a few people would find my comments helpful. I am a CPA and these are my thoughts, but I floss with pieces of string my dog eats and then shits out later so maybe don't listen to me.

1. First of all and most critically, this sub has 8.6M tendie-loving bastards, the majority of who probably acquired positions in $GME (and other equities) with money they could afford to lose, but there were probably some who lost their entire ass (and some) and maybe at risk of losing their partner/spouse, their house, car, whatever. If that's you, dude I swear, life will go on and things will be ok again. We all are probably familiar w/the Crash of '29 (i.e., upside down rocket) - stories of people jumping out of windows, etc. People were so blown away about how they lost everything in the market, they resorted to suicide. I don't care if you lost money in this gamble or not, if you or someone you know is in a dark place and/or contemplating suicide, don't wait, call a family member, a friend, or even the suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Nothing that happens is ever worth taking your own life and I guarantee people around you would care, and if you think no one would care, I don't even know you and just know that I would care. Whatever the outcome of this or anything else, life will go on and things will eventually get better. If you're clinically depressed, get help, please - talk to somebody as soon as possible and if needed, medicate yourself - anti-depressants can do wonders for balancing you out. Even if you did something incredibly stupid that will financially destroy you, it won't be forever and you will move past it. You matter. You have worth. Don't ever forget that.
2. Due Diligence (DD) is critical and there are ways to get started. First of all, if you can link up with an introduction to accounting and/or finance class via Coursera or another free site, I would highly recommend it. Basic accounting will teach you the basics of financial statements (e.g., what is an income statement? what do the various buckets mean? What is a balance sheet? Statement of Cash Flow, etc.?) basically the underpinning of the rules that are used to record transactions that ultimate flow to the public. Accounting or finance will probably teach you about common financial analysis and ratios (think current/quick ratio for liquidity tests, leverage ratios, profitability, P/E, etc.) and what they mean/how to interpret. But ratios out of context don't tell you much - look at the industry - major competitors. How do the analytics compare in relevant context? Also, a bit more advanced than basic accounting or finance but there are valuation models that try to predict company share prices based on methods like discounted cash flows or dividend yields and predict based on growth rates and discount rates where they forecast out the future success of the business based on harbingers like revenue etc and attempt to determine if the price is over/under valued in the current market. Also, make sure to read through the company's annual report - form 10-K (annual report) and 10-Q (quarterly report) on sec.gov is a great resource. Just type the ticker symbol into the search bar and search for form 10-K on the company's filings. In addition to the financial statements, there is a large section that precedes it dedicated to something called ""management discussion and analysis"" or MD&A that focuses on the company strategy and outlook for the future as well as risk factors. Some are generic like ""shitty economy"" but others are very real to the industry (e.g., we use a lot of adamantium in our products, so if we run into supply chain issues, we're all fucked, etc.). In that same vein, subscribe to the company's investor relations emails - you'll get news releases about the company as well as notifications for their earnings releases (where they talk about if they hit their targets but also strategy and execution).  Finally, if you have gleaned some accounting knowledge you can read the company's notes to the financial statements which contain more information on key accounting policies and other things. But even after all this, you need to reconcile with the fact that it's still a fucking gamble. Even after all that research, your pick(s) can still lose money. But it's just a more educated gamble than seeing people ""YOLO"" into a stock on Reddit and decide to throw ten grand at it (does not qualify as DD).
3. If that's all beyond you, hook up with a financial advisor at like a brokerage firm. They'll make a little money off your trades, but if they're returning 15-20% annually, it's won't mean much in the grand scheme of things. Some people like the thrill of doing it themselves others don't. And try to pick up on some personal money strategies, like making a budget and sticking to it. Automatically transferring 10% of your paycheck into a savings account (or a brokerage account). Anticipating unexpected costs where you can (e.g., home maintenance A/C goes out, $10 grand for a new one, appliances are expensive AF, water leaks, mold, if you have a car needing new tires, brakes, engine problems, or even just potentially owing federal income taxes, etc.). You'd be surprised how much money you can save just by not eating out or refinancing your house (if you have a mortgage consider a refi bc rates are really low right now but do your fucking research and don't get destroyed by a shady lender selling you a shitty mortgage).

That's it. I'm done. If it helps 1 person, I'm glad I spent the time writing it. But again, don't take my advice, I chug the stuff under the sink.",2021-02-05 14:34:45

and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story. 
Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism. 

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass. 

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself. 

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. 

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.

Biotech impressions (Tiny D&D on AUPH),15,lczebn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczebn/biotech_impressions_tiny_dd_on_auph/,20,1612528192.0,"So, what is everyone's view on biotech? I found recent success but can't tell if it's just luck. Every damn day there is biotech on top movers with 50+ percent move up. 

Tiny D&D => $AUPH

Overview

In Jan,  had their drug (Lupkynis) approved that treats Lupus something... idk I'm not a doctor. This drug replaces an outdated treatment and is taken orally (nice). In the U.S. between 200,000 and 300,000 poor souls could benefit from this after paying $140,000 a year (AUPH expects $65k net per patient) because big pharma is greedier than HFs. The important part is they received a patent for this treatment that lasts till 2037 so CVS can't make a generic over-the-counter version. 

Why do I think it is a buy? It is almost back to pre-approval price (around $15) and for the very questionable math I did below.

Because this is a one of a kind Lupus killer, I am assuming they will get at least 20% of the 200,000 Lupus victims (40,000) X $40,000 net per (I am being extremely conservative) = a grand total of $1.6 billion from the drug. Can they even sell it? maybe, idk I saw a few insider texts from nurses who received messages from the AUPH sales team looking to get something going. I don't care about that tho. I care about them getting bought out by a big ole pharma daddy for 30+ a share.

Alright retards, I hate to see $BB get labeled as a full on meme stock as it has the best fundamentals and currently undervalued still. On top of all news from the past few weeks on partnerships and other catalysts. I figured I‚Äôd post up some more info on it from today. 

As you can see from today‚Äôs chart, it finally started to divert from the main meme stocks now. BlackBerry is seeing significant order and backlog growth. 83% of the company‚Äôs software revenue is recurring. 

In 2021, there are going to be many catalysts for BlackBerry. These catalysts will support the stock price bigly. Application providers will be able to get their hands on IVY in September 2021. 20 car manufacturers will be targeted. The good thing is BlackBerry will make a public announcement whenever one signs up. Also, BlackBerry is now increasingly free cash flow positive. This is a huge game changer for the company. Investors will value BlackBerry stock much more attractively because of it. There was $29 million in free cash flow for its latest quarter.

Price Target: I‚Äôm pretty bullish on it coming back to $14-15 by 2/19, with the possibility of coming back to $20 EOM

TL;DR: BUY $BB",2021-02-05 14:25:46

"Previous post got removed so posting it again. Remember, you can write off your stock market losses as tax-deductible. This will truly be the most non-bullshit thing you will read and learn today. Save this post somewhere.",325,lcz87u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcz87u/previous_post_got_removed_so_posting_it_again/,32,1612527581.0,"This is not financial advice, I am writing this because hopefully it will benefit some of you. So you have lost a lot of money in GME or AMC or the stock of your choice over the last few days. I am sure you are feeling pretty hopeless, and trust me, I am there with you. 

But did you know that you can offset this loss by reporting it to the Internal Revenue Service and use it as a tax-deductible? Internal Revenue Service allows you to report realized capital loss up to $3000 on the taxes you file and deduct that amount from your overall taxable income. 

**What is a realized capital loss?**

Simply put, it is the loss you have sustained after selling your stocks at a price below your buying price. 

**This is great. How much money can I write off?** 

$3000. It will be deducted from your overall taxable income. 

**What if I have more than $3000 in loss?**

Internal Revenue Services allows you to carry over the remaining loss over the first $3000 over to your next year's taxable income. 

**How do I do that?**

Along with how you regularly file your taxes, you would need to fill out Form 8949 and schedule D for your tax return. 

**What if I have gained some money and lost some?**

 If you are in net gain, you will report this income to the Internal Revenue Service, and will be taxed for that. If you are in net loss, you will report this net loss to the Internal Revenue Services for the tax credit. That is, your total gain from the market-your total loss from the market. If this number is negative, you qualify for getting this deduction. 

**This link will give you a good idea about the concept:** [**https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp)

**If you are still with me:**

If you are new to stocks, believe me, this will not be your only loss in the market. Sometimes you will win big, you will lose big. Just remember to learn from both of them. Find out what you did right and keep trading and investing that way. Find out what you did wrong and avoid that in the future. No matter what people say, always remember, it is your money, and it will impact your future. Good luck!


Edit: 

There seem to be a few common questions, I will answer them here. 

What if I haven‚Äôt sold? 
 
Then this does not apply to you. It is only applicable on realized losses, I.e. the losses that you incur after selling 

Will this apply to 2020 taxes or 2021? 

2021

Is this US only? 
Yes, but I believe British tax rules also have a similar position. If anyone knows about other countries, drop a comment and I will update it here

So will I get 3000 off my taxes? 

No. It will be applied to your Taxable income. For example, if your taxable income was $50,000 and if you have incurred $3000 in loss in the stock market, your taxable income after this provision will be $47,000.

You should also know the washsale rule, which states that if you have sold and bought the same stock again in 30 days, you will not be qualified for this provision. So if you have already cut your losses, it is better to stay out now, unless you‚Äôre absolutely sure that you will make back your investment and more profit.

There is one guy who runs the show there, John Merriwether; he is VP of Investor Relations.

John has been sitting comfy in his seat for 6 years. Despite the massive influx of attention, he has yet to say a word or put out a press release. As our rocket ship prepares to take off, why don't have any sort of participation?

I encourage each and every shareholder / options holder to email him and plead OUR case. He can be reached on LinkedIn ([here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmerriwether/)). EVERYONE from CEO, COO, CFO, etc. can be reached there.

The more pressure we apply, the sooner he will act. It is in their best interest to do so!!!

So I tried to understand their strategy and their move.. I'm not an expert in finance, I don't understand the specifics, I use my logics, I just try to understand whats going on, be free to correct me and put your insight, I think it's a great exercise. 

\-Early January, GME and AMC are in a very bad situation so they bet that their stock whould go down.

\-Mid-late January some Ape from reddits decide to push these stock to the moon. So Hedge funds can't close their shorts for a certain time. The more time they wait, more fee and interest they have to pay. 

\-The goal of these amazing ape is to bleed the hedge fund.

\-After  the little squeeze, the hedge funds claim that they lost billions $$$. This is where I become sceptical. What if they didnt lose that much money, how much money can they really lose in a few day for not closing shorts? We always say that we don't lose money until we sell our stock at lost, it's probably the same thing for hedge funds, no? They probably lost money, but billions seems a bit far fetch, no?  So, maybe they are trying to give us a small victory, a fake victory for the cause.

\-This week, a lot of stock have lost momentum, their goal is to close their shorts fast. They want to close for 2 reasons, they are losing money and on the 9th of february there's a report they will tell, that they didnt close their shorts.  If that report says that the hedge fund didnt close their shorts, it's very probable it will trigger another squeeze.  

\-Hedge funds have 2 advantages over us: they have knowledge of their true position and they can buy/sell during after hour.

\-So if I was the Hedge funds, this week Iwould use every dirty trick I know to crash the stock, short ladder, media manipulation, etc. During the weekend or monday, I close most of my shorts and right before the report is release, they buy a tons of stock of GME and AMC. Not only they can close their shorts at like 6$ instead of 18$ for AMC, but they can make money from the squeeze. With that strategy they could break even and maybe even make a bit of money! ? This way, it's a win-win situation everybody makes money.

They are also retarded. I bet the short on GME >200%.

Do you think they sold at a loss? No. Melvin was loaned money to keep the shorts open. Point72 boss laughs like crazy reading our comments. They are all short. My advice is to hold the stock. 

In my opinion the drop is due to the new reddit users who bought but have no experience so they sold to limit their losses. Their behavior made the quotations fall. I've been saying since last thursday that this game will last 2-3 weeks. Hold!

In Europe they have to report immediately to the supervisors when they exceed 0.20% and then they have to report the same day if they change the short position by 0.10%.

Complaints about the above can be broken down to this:

1) Cramer and the rest of the news media are in the business of getting eyeballs. Not helping people invest or make money. GME/AMC/whatever else was the hot story so they ran it. Their ‚Äúadvice‚Äù is a facade. 

2) Robinhood shut down trading in GME and other meme stocks because it became a victim of its own success. They didnt have enough cash to support your trades so they stopped trading. You trusted a startup to handle your investing and you paid the price. Honestly I think you should be grateful they didnt let you buy more at $300/sh. But I realize im arguing with retards here.

3) The SEC is looking into WSB because they think that hedge funds supported and profited off the GME hype. They dont care about your five shares and üíéüôåüèº memes. Honestly just take one minute and look at the stock chart, are you really surprised the SEC is investigating who might have manipulated the stock UP rather than back down to earth. Get a grip on reality.

4) Short ladders aren‚Äôt real and even if they were, they‚Äôd only work if there isn‚Äôt real investor demand for the stock. And we all know there isnt an iota of real demand at >$50. If the stock was actually worth $1,000 then it would trade at $1,000. Piling into a stock to push a short squeeze is just the inverse so take a look in the mirror and don‚Äôt act like you are so righteous. Just like how a short squeeze doesn‚Äôt last forever, neither would a ladder. Its clear now which side is ‚Äúright.‚Äù

If you lost money on GME its because you got sucked into the hype or got greedy. Perhaps you took a virtuous route and saw a community that tried to take down a bunch of hedge funds.

And lets be honest. You won! But very briefly. Melvin‚Äôs image will be forever tarnished by this and Wall Street now has to respect the little guys. But this came at the cost of many small investors who might have lost all they had saved up.

You can hold your shares all you want, but maybe take a hard look at who‚Äôs really at fault. No one forced you to double down on GME at $100.",2021-02-05 13:53:51

Each portion of the phrase is important.

# Gamble

Stocks are a gamble.  If you lose, it's not because there's a deep state conspiracy to keep the man down.  It's because losing is something that happens quite often when you gamble.  You don't walk into a casino and complain that the system is rigged for the house to win.  That's obvious.  If you don't like that, then don't gamble at a casino.

# Try to make money

The point of stocks is to make money.  Makes sense, right?  So if you're buying stocks for other reasons, consider that there might be cheaper alternatives.

For example,

## Sticking it to the man

You can volunteer for political campaigns or attend protests for free, and those are probably a much more effective methods of trying to combat the increasing wealth gap.  When you gamble in the stock market, you're more likely to make the rich richer than the other way around.

## Sense of belonging

You can actually make memes and participate in communities for free on reddit.  Buying stock is not required.

## Holding something that makes you feel good

Perhaps a teddy bear or a weighted blanket would be a cheaper and more tangible option.",2021-02-05 13:48:39

So as the title implies, I've noticed an interesting trend with some of the posts and comments being made on WSB, other investing subreddits, and the various Discord communities out there. It seems that all of the paper handed bitches telling everyone $GME, $AMC, or other 'meme stocks' are dead seem to only really come out during market open. Inversely, during after hours or market close, it would seem the majority of posts and comments propose a much more positive outlook on these stocks and are genuinely helpful and bot-free so to speak.

Now if you are to assume that the hedgies or other institutions (like I do) are behind the shills and bots then it would only make sense that they would be active during trading hours. That's when they would make the most impact trying to get people to sell and give up hope right? Why would they care what we talk about when we can't make moves?

You can pretty easily see what I mean if you scroll through 'new' now compared to say noon. Because right now I see a lot of people spreading positivity, talking about long-term prospects, and the like. Even the people right now who are talking about selling or bag holding are at least doing so in a way that's backed up by an explanation. Compare this to what it's like after the bell rings and all you see is suspicious accounts giving radical advice sometimes even without any context at all.

The idea of buying & holding GME to stick to the ‚Äúbig guys‚Äù is bizarre,37,lcykl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcykl7/the_idea_of_buying_holding_gme_to_stick_to_the/,45,1612525304.0,"
First of all, I‚Äôm truly sorry for all those who recently lost money in trading the so-called meme stocks. While some people may find other people‚Äôs financial loss somewhat entertaining, I want to emphasize behind every ‚Äúloss porn‚Äù, stood a real person. I hope everyone who lost recently will find better luck in the future and know that at end of the day, you can always make these money back so long you are healthy and alive! 

That said, the group think that had led up to the bubble and burst of meme stocks (in particular, GME) has left me baffled about the deceptive nature that has motivated people into holding a clearly losing position.

‚ÄúSunken Cost‚Äù fallacy aside, the idea that if you keep buying or holding stocks like GME will make the rich bleed is frankly bizarre. Sure, some big player like Melvin capital got burned, but please understand that they aren‚Äôt the only player or HF in Wall Street (on the contrast, they are more akin to a small fish in a big sea). In reality, a lot of HFs don‚Äôt profit from directional trades (long or short a stock), but rather, profits are made from longing or shorting the stock‚Äôs Volatility (hence why more HFs actually made a killing from their Straddle positions - feel free to look up what that means). Trying to convince other people to dump their life savings into a volatile play like GME with the argument that it‚Äôll help bankrupt the rich cannot be further from the truth. 

I know I‚Äôll get downvoted for saying this but I‚Äôm just shattered from seeing people losing their life savings while believing this is somehow doing a good deed. I pray that a miracle happens and GME will bounce back soon on a catalyst so at least those who lost everything can get a chance to recover. But please, before the meaningless shills, do some research about the basics of how hedge funds work and the economy in general before convincing others that it‚Äôs ok to lose money in a gamble like this. 

Good luck to all!",2021-02-05 13:41:44

Apple has never wanted to work with Tesla, and likely won‚Äôt. They want to build a new, more affordable EV from the floor up. Tesla is obviously the king, but excluding them, who else is even in the competition. GOEVS EV design set them apart.

Friday we closed at 325 with sentiment strong as fuck and then all of a sudden on Monday, over a weekend where we saw people put up billboards spreading awareness of the GME movement across the country, we suddenly drop $100 on barely any volume? That don‚Äôt seem right at all. It‚Äôs gotta be some kind of short ladder attack or some type of hedgie fuckery my retard brain can‚Äôt quite comprehend. 

But what I do understand is that this whole situation smells fishy as all fuck. If the shorts covered then they would be clear of this whole thing. What is the point of having all these bot accounts spread negative sentiment in the threads? What is the point of continuing to have robinhood/other brokerages restrict buying? 

If this was really over they would have washed their hands of this whole situation and moved on to their next scheme. 

But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over. 

I think the hedgies still have significant short positions that need to be covered and us üíéüôå apes of the retard alliance won‚Äôt sell them our shares. Remember, as long as the shorts have shares they need to buy back and our autistic asses keep buying and holding the available shares, at some point they will need to pay our asking price, no matter how retarded it is.

What I have left is sitting there waiting to see. I'm not worried, it's been fun, it's been exciting, hell probably the most excitement I've had since this whole lockdown crap. 

I've learned a lot, not so much about stocks but about people. I've learned that theres people on both sides of things that just want to rag on someone who's worse off than they are. I guess it makes them feel superior. I don't let them get to me. In fact I feel bad for them. It must suck to be that unhappy.

I learned that a common enemy really does bring people together. In hopes of fighting the dishonesty wall street. I saw people or all races, ethnicities, orientations, and political & social views come together. It was an American thing in the start but when it seemed the shorters were winning I saw people from Austria, Germany, Canada, Korea Japan, New Zeland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and more not only give words of support but their money to keep things going.

I saw good things happen, I saw a 15 year old kid take his 3k and make 250k and pull his profit to pay for college. I saw a 10 year old kid get rich from a gift his mom gave him years ago. I saw a man find out his dog needed life saving surgery and because of his profit he could do it. I saw a guy donate nintindo switches (a lot of them) to St Judes. I saw someone buy tendie lunches for all the workers at Gillette childrens healthcare.  I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I saw so many reports of good things! People helping people with their winnings.

Was it worth it even if I never recoup my money? Hell yes! It's great to see so many people come together despite their differences. To see so many good things come out of it. Were there greedy people involved, sure. Were there some who stepped on others, sure. Happens everywhere, but it's not always balanced with the good. It's nice to be reminded of the good.

Oh and I'm holding! Diamond Hands till death!!

and because most of us never knew that could happen, we lost track of whether the squeeze had happened yet or not. they engineered the perfect condition for them to cover their shorts, even if they were already starting to cover on the way up to $500 (which is partly why it went to 500), they would've had to cover even higher (up to $1000 probably) **if buying wasn't shut off for everyone (majority of retail, the ones squeezing them) except for them.**",2021-02-05 13:28:13

First of all, if you are going to downvote me because I am not saying ""buy GME and Hold"" you can eat my ass. I could give a shit about karma. That said, here is my advice, take it or leave it.

First of all, I like trading stocks, and I like making easy money even more, but I also know that people that make money in the stock market are shrewd and pragmatic (think Cuban and Burry). But PLEASE FFS DO NOT DUMP your tuition money, life savings, rent, insulin money or whatever important thing you are jeopardizing by buying into this stock now. Treat it like Vegas, only play with money you are okay losing.

NOW:A wise man once said of the money you can invest, keep 40% in cash and never put more than 15% in one single trade, that's how you keep from blowing up your account.

Lastly fuck Robinhood, stop using them, switch to a broker that won't fuck you. Otherwise, I hope everyone reading this gets filthy rich and as Zach says ""fuck the g-ride, I want the machines that are making them!""

P.S. let me save many of you posts: I will certainly try hard to NOT cut Melvins dick with my paper hands because I am undoubtedly sucking it.",2021-02-05 13:28:09

How to Cope,6,lcybsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcybsd/how_to_cope/,8,1612524461.0,"Hello, everyone. I know it's a difficult time for you all, whether you're stressed out that your +1000% will drop in an instant to -500% or if your account is -500% to -50000%. Let's remember that there's always that prime coping mechanism we can always utilize to our advantage:

Jacking off. 

Yes, jacking off. 

Even though the house is burning all around us, our friends have left us to die, our neighbors look strangely at us as if we're delusional. **Just jack off**. 

3 times a day is not enough, sometimes. You need to take it up several notches during these dark, dark times. The refractory period? Well, during those restful refractory periods, don't even look at stock charts or trading info. Just do something productive. And when you think you're ready to nut again, pull out your phone, go to your favorite website and your favorite personal private place and give yourself the high of your life. It's not that hard and without even knowing it, some of you are already skilled at it. 

In order to maximize the pleasure of jacking off, for me, I have three rules:

1. Variation -- jack off to different things in different sessions. Just like people get bored with a game they're good at, people won't get as hard to similar things. Try new flavors, new smells.
2. Diet and exercise -- in order to maximize the volume of the nut, one must ensure that their diet supports the necessary ingredients for the nut. Boost your vitamin and mineral intake (as to which specific ones, just google it). Exercise builds testosterone, which ultimately ramps up the production of your white cream. 
3. Get some damn sleep -- I know some of you retards don't get sleep nowadays because a nuclear bomb had been dropped on your account, or your rocket ship fell back to earth. But this is important in having a good state of mind and a good nut. 

Depending on the size of your dong, you'll either have what we call a ""long squeeze"" or for most people, ""a short squeeze"". 

Regardless of the security you hold, regardless of your background, regardless of your birthrights--if any--your physiology will always be here for you. It will be with you in the hardest times, the best times. And for stock trading, nutting has helped me cope through the periods of intensity during the glory days of TSLA, SPY 0 days til' expiry, NIO, PLTR, and now GME. 

Just let it all out.",2021-02-05 13:27:41

Squeezing before Feb 9.,59,lcyb3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcyb3n/squeezing_before_feb_9/,31,1612524395.0,"Not financial advice, I'm retarded. 

Alright listen up. The squeeze is either happening on or before the 9th, or not at all. On the 9th, Nasdaq short interest data gets updated after market close. This will tell us whether all these places reporting decreases in short interest like S3 are reporting false data or not.

If they are, the plan drafted up by them and whoever paid them off probably goes like this: S3 publishes fake data to drive down retail interest while ladder attacks and share buying limits work to dump the share price. If the Nasdaq data shows there still is high short interest, at least for the days S3 reported on, it would contradict S3 and make them out to be implicit in manipulation. Considering they want to remain a business in the future, they would only agree to this if short sellers made them look right in the end. This would give us our first signal that the squeeze is coming, S3 suddenly starts reporting upticks in short interest just before the 9th. Shorts would then work to drive the price into the ground to their desired price while lining this up with S3 reporting ""gradual"" short interest increases, which is easy thanks to these daily ladder attacks. 

If they aren't, then there is no squeeze, and everyone here should take to the streets to protest the SEC for failing to protect retail investors.

At this point, the ladder is working. GME hype is six feet underground. But, considering short sellers are the greediest form of human filth on the planet, it's not impossible for them to do what I've outlined above, especially if the interest on these shorts is pennies compared to what they'll make if the price stays low. Keep an eye on how places like S3 start reporting data in the days leading up to the 9th, that'll be the signal. üíéüôå",2021-02-05 13:26:35

There is only 50.68M shares available for purchase. Last we knew short interest was over 122 percent per finviz. 

Short interest information is out 2/9. All the short interest shit you‚Äôve seen on companies such as S3 and onyx is their prediction. It could be true or as bad as throwing darts blind folded.   

One thing for sure is that the shorts are still fighting. Bots posting, DTCC still limiting shares, media still shilling how we‚Äôre defeated, etc. We should continue to fight. Hold your shares.

Dont sell for a loss. Average down if you can. You bought 100 shares at 250? Buy another 100 shares and lower your cost average to 150 per share if you bought your second batch at 50. Doing this will remove available shares from the pool. Keep averaging down and if you eventually want to get out, then it‚Äôll be easier than having to stomach 250/share cost basis.

Just getting into stocks?,12,lcy8sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcy8sy/just_getting_into_stocks/,12,1612524176.0,"OK so for those of you that are getting into stocks like I was a few weeks back or want to know trading patterns I would use Stockcharts.com. Or if you have any suggestions/improvements from what I've learned I would be happy to discuss down below.

When you are investigating whether or not a stock is a buy you want to look at two things the RSI and the MACD

The RSI is the 'Relative strength index' and is on a scale from 1-100 with horizontal lines going from the 30 and 70 mark these lines indicates whether the stock is overbought(70) and oversold(30). If you see a stock at an RSI of 77 there is a likely chance that it will go down vice verses with an RSI of 33 where the price will likely go up. Then there are instances of stocks that fluctuate in between the 30 and 70 lines, those are called floats. For the most part that is what is depicted in chart the top of the chart.

Secondly, you want to look at the MACD graph(on the bottom of the chart). This stands for 'Moving average convergence/divergence'. As this one is a bit more confusing I won't go into a lot of depth. However, you will notice 2 lines, one red and one black. The black line is the MACD line and is calculated by the 12th day exponential moving average minus the 26th day exponential moving average. It basically just tells you whether the graph is moving up, down, or sideways. The red line is the signal line which is the 9th day exponential moving average. Which makes it look like a smoothed out version of the MACD line. All you need to know is that when the black line crosses the redline in a positive trend then the stock is going to go up, and when the black line crosses the red line in a negative trend then the stock Is fixing to fall.

To sum up, if you see a low RSI with a positive trend from the MACD you should buy or hold. And if you see a high RSI with a negative trending MACD line then you should sell or test your luck on holding. Everything is finite and the graphs are not always correct but these are great indicators.",2021-02-05 13:22:56

Alright retards, let‚Äôs talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)

OP, the ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù fuck that he is, is looking for a long term hold and he thinks he found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the industry. And that fucking industry is rapidly growing. We are talking printer go fucking brrrr. Thank sleepy!

Just google ‚Äútop solar companies‚Äù and tell OP which companies have the best product and best customer ratings. Spoiler alert, Sunpower is #1.

Sunpower hit $57 dollars before crashing down to $40 where it hit hard hard resistance today. Were talkin huge buy orders for 2 mill+. And even look at who owns it - bunch Blackrock, Citedal, the likes. I agree, fuck these guys, but at the same time, why bet against them? It‚Äôs gonna go up, and keep going up.

What most people don‚Äôt know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone‚Äôs favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it‚Äôs game changing. 

Some technical analysis for you autists. Sunpower literally has a revenue of 274 million, while Sunrun (at over 2x the market cap) is at 209 million. Sunpower also cut manufacturing costs by splitting into two companies (SPWR and Maxeon Technolgies). Maxeon is manufacturing solar panels for SPWR, and they are doing it overseas. This split happened in late August and has yet to affect their profit, but will completely reshape SPWR‚Äôs profit margin in the near future.

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar sales don‚Äôt really pick up till spring. So getting in now and ride the rocket to the moon!

$ENZC is over a billion now so I‚Äôm allowed to tell you retards about it. Last year at this time it was a trips play with terrible management.

September Enzolytics initiated a merger with Bioclonetics. The Bioclonetics CEO took over as CEO for ENZC, and this man has kept his word all along. One of the best low cap CEOs to date.

Bioclonetics science combined with Enzolytics science was a maneuver into a masterful biotech company.

They moved to Texas A&M the headquarters of Operation Warp Speed. 

Essentially what they have is monoclonal antibodies that were originally developed as a treatment for HIV, and still will be used for HIV. Covid has HIV type qualities, and this turned into a Covid play pretty quickly. They also recently filed for a patent to treat MS.

The upcoming catalysts are a move from OTC Pink to most likely QB, but it‚Äôs expected that they could apply for the Nasdaq later this year when they meet the requirements.

The CEO has directly mentioned Eli Lilly and Gilead. They are currently undergoing a toxicity study, and once that‚Äôs accomplished they should get the green light from the fda, and the big pharma partnership comes into play. 

This is a super rough, typing on my phone while I‚Äôm drunk version of the DD. But seriously look into it. I‚Äôve been in since sub penny, it got up to .56 today before settling at .47. This is one of the most explosive stocks of the year and should be multi dollar.

5 year outlook it has the potential to be a $25-$50 stock. 3 billion authorized shares with a heavy insider ownership stake. Once this hits national news it will really blow up.

Again do more DD, this is the tip of the ice berg and very sloppily written.

Yeah, with where we are right now I wish I would have sold last Wednesday when my $1200 was worth $13000 and gotten back in today.  Hindsight is a bitch. But how does it make sense if someone bought at 300 to sell at 50? A lot of these dumbasses came for the movement and have been saying they don't care if they lose anyway. At this point I feel like it makes more sense to just ride it out. Maybe it goes back up, maybe it goes back down to $2. But shaming people for still holding right now is just plain mean.

Edit: People questioning my credibility, fuck off why would I rat out my own source and put him on the spotlight??? You fucken dumb?

So a friend of mine personally knows a guy that works at a Hedgefund. He said the hedges unfortunately have already found a way to cover their shorts (illegally). We might not see a change the short percentages because all they have to do create new shorts that are profitable to cover the old shorts.

 For example, if I have a short that's -$5, I just invest in a new short that's +$5 to cover for it. That's why the hedges have been doubling down over and over again. They also used these short ladder tactics to cover their shorts. They can do this over and over and over and over again. They're basically just recycling shorts in and out of the market.

I fucken hate to say it, but I think this is the end. They strategically and illegally found a new way to win. Unless someone else can refute this, I will hear you out with an open mind.

Keep in mind, I do want to fucken go to moon, but logistically and logically it doesn't seem possible right now when the odds are against us.

Hi! I'm new here and I plan on holding GME for at least 12 months, to be exact December 27, 2021 Or beyond. The reason for this is I liquidated gains to go into GME.I KNOW PEOPLE DON""T WANT TO HEAR TAX SHIT BUT... this is also strategy from my perspective. Eventually one has to cut losses and If I do cut losses than I would want to maximize my loss. I plan on investing for the rest of my life and eventually those gains will net against those losses. I can already use them but why would I? I have at least December. If I like GME maybe I will keep it, If I really don't want to pay tax or I want a nice loss carry forward (as in the loss is like balance on your return to net gains against) then I will do that. That gives me a time frame. I am a complete noob to this however I came in made a business/investment decision and I need to own that. It showed me I need to manage my emotions (still) and there is a lot I need to learn.

I am Canadian so technically if you have gains in prior years you can carry back. I am not sure who it impacts people from other nations but I am sure with some google fu you can figure that out. 

I am still optimistic, at the same time life goes on and I have a ton of shit to do, like dropping of my wife's boyfriend to his guitar lessons. Till then folks.

It's a decent amount of money (full month's wages) and losing it would suck, but I knew it when I got into it.

Now I hold because I'm not going to sell at a loss. I either sell with a profit or not at all. The trick is to only put as much money in as you can afford to lose, then you won't get panicky paper hands when thoughts like ""how am I gonna make rent this month???"" jump to your head.

If I lose everything I put in, I shrug and move on. It's not even 1% of my total savings.

But I am definitely going to bite myself in the ass if I sell now, and then it jumps back up later. What I lose if the stock stays down is just money. What I lose if I panic-sell now is a great potential opportunity.

15 Facts About the Diamond [Hands],5,ld7c6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld7c6e/15_facts_about_the_diamond_hands/,1,1612561278.0,"First of all, obligatory üíéüëêüöÄ. 
Second of all, I am one of the ""little guys"" in on GME at $260 and AMC at $13. Holding with my measly -$1000ish loss. 

Now that I got that out of the way, let's learn about diamonds, shall we?

These 15 facts about diamonds was pulled from [here](https://www.brilliantearth.com/news/15-amazing-facts-about-diamonds/).  I'd like to just post this as a very ""I come in peace"" post. Yes, I am biased towards those of us holding out prices. I also feel very proud that we helped pull AMC out of bankruptcy.

Anyways.

1

The ancient Romans and Greeks believed that diamonds were tears cried by the gods or splinters from falling stars, and Romans believed that Cupid‚Äôs arrows were tipped with diamonds (perhaps the earliest association between diamonds and romantic love).

We can imagine these tears of the hedge funds that were trying to create 20% more stock than is available, to then make a profit off of. Some (seeming) ""gods"" are mortal too.

2

Diamonds are billions of years old‚Äîin some cases more than three billion years old.

How about 3.73B? The same as the market cap for $GME... Interesting.

3

Diamonds form about 100 miles below ground and have been carried to the earth‚Äôs surface by deep volcanic eruptions.

Months ago, something surfaced from the extreme deep. u/deepfuckingvalue that is.  This volcano is about to erupt.

4

Diamonds are made of a single element‚Äîthey‚Äôre nearly 100% carbon. Under the immense heat and pressure far below the earth‚Äôs surface, the carbon atoms bond in a unique way that results in diamonds‚Äô beautiful and rare crystalline structure.

The farther down this goes, the more pressure is being exerted, both on us, the holders and on the ones who have outrageous shorts. Your carbon hands will either burn up like paper or solidify and harden into beautiful diamonds.

5

The word diamond derives from the Greek word ‚Äúadamas,‚Äù which means invincible or indestructible. Which makes sense because‚Ä¶

Together: adamas, divided we fall.

6

Diamonds are the very hardest natural substance. The only thing that can scratch a diamond is another diamond.

No high fives please.

7

Diamonds have been valued and coveted for thousands of years. There is evidence that diamonds were being collected and traded in India as early as the fourth century BC. In the first century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny is quoted as having said, ‚ÄúDiamond is the most valuable, not only of precious stones, but of all things in this world.‚Äù

Those of us still holding, being formed by pressure. We are precious and we hold the value.

8

Ancient Hindus used diamonds in the eyes of devotional statues, and believed that a diamond could protect its wearer from danger.

Holding leads to pressure, pressure leads to diamonds, diamonds lead to protection. More diamonds, more protection. 

9

Many ancient cultures believed that diamonds gave the wearer strength and courage during battle, and some kings wore diamonds on their armor as they rode into battle.

This is the highest medal one can give themselves. The üíé is a self-appointed badge of honor here.

10

During the Middle Ages diamonds were thought to have healing properties able to cure ailments ranging from fatigue to mental illness.

I don't think it's working on the mental illness front. And I believe most of us are fatigued, so as we all knew, the middle ages we're full of shit. (And trebuchets)

11

The countries that are the main sources of diamonds have changed over time. India was the world‚Äôs original source of diamonds, beginning in the 1400s when Indian diamonds began to be sold in Venice and other European trade centers. Then in the 1700s India‚Äôs diamond supplies declined and Brazil became the world‚Äôs major source of diamonds, until the late 1800s when a huge diamond reserve was discovered in South Africa.¬† Today, diamonds are mined in many parts of the world. Brilliant Earth goes above and beyond the current industry standards to offer¬†Beyond Conflict Free Diamonds‚Ñ¢¬†with a listed origin of Canada, Botswana Sort, or Russia.

Hands all over the world are now in this diamond trade with us. Just look at the posts a few days ago. Plenty of countries trying to make this movement work.

12

The largest diamond ever discovered was called the¬†Cullinan¬†diamond, and weighed in at an amazing 3106 carats, or 1.33 pounds. Discovered in 1905 in South Africa, the mine‚Äôs owner and the South African leaders gave the diamond to King Edward. The Cullinan was eventually cut into 9 large diamonds and 100 smaller ones, and the three largest of these are on display in the Tower of London as part of the crown jewels.

I'm not sure who has the largest overall loss right now, but I'm sure we can have a top 10 losses list somewhere at this point. (Loss from origin, not height).  Whomever holds that right now is definitely the largest diamond here.

13

The first known use of a¬†diamond engagement ring¬†took place in 1477, when Archduke Maxmillian of Austria gave Mary of Burgundy a gold ring featuring an M spelled out in diamonds.

When shit takes off, I will buy my wife's boyfriend a ring to ask her to marry him. 

14

Lab diamonds have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds. They¬†are sustainable diamonds that have minimal environmental impact. Discover Brilliant Earth‚Äôs collection of¬†lab diamonds.

All of our diamonds are the same. No matter the cost of production.

15

The most mind-blowing diamond facts of all: Scientists have discovered a planet that they believe is composed mostly of carbon, and is one-third pure diamond!¬† Discovered in 2004, the planet orbits a nearby star in the Milky Way, and is named ‚Äú55 Cancri e‚Äù (which, in our opinion, is not a sufficiently glamorous name for such an extraordinary planet). Perhaps even more amazing, scientists have discovered a star that is essentially a diamond of ten billion trillion trillion carats.¬† They named the star Lucy after the Beatles song ‚ÄúLucy in the Sky with Diamonds.‚Äù (We approve.)
While diamonds have clearly created a lot of joy for people throughout history, they have too often resulted in suffering in the communities where they‚Äôre mined. At Brilliant Earth we believe diamonds shine brighter when they‚Äôre sourced in an ethical, environmentally friendly way.¬†Learn more¬†about the issues surrounding diamond mining, and what we‚Äôre doing to bring about change.

We're all on this rocket. It's still primed. Fuck the moon, to Lucy we go! 

There may be a lot of suffering. But as many here say, do not put your life's saving into this.

My two pieces of advice, If you can _bull_ with me;
1. only use money that you're willing to throw in a literal trash can. If you can do that and feel ok with it, then by all means, throw it away.  _MAYBE_ the trash collector will knock on your door and give you back your money as well as all the other money they found in the trash.

2.  NEVER. LOOK. BACK.

My thoughts on AMC,5,ld79iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld79iw/my_thoughts_on_amc/,1,1612561023.0,"Think about the competition of AMC: -Netflix, Amazon, Hulu etc. Online streaming services are the most threatening competitors of the cinema industry... But the thing we need to focus on is the delivery of the product (the shows). The range of content on online streaming services is far wider, however, they are increasingly tending towards in house productions. Online streaming services have their content catalogues diversified and increasingly produced in-house. This way, they own the rights to the media and can stream it without paying enormous leasing fees. That's why Netflix keeps taking Friends off of their service, because another online service outbids them for the rights to the lease of that media. For this reason, and trust me on this I have studied this for a while, online streaming services will continue to vigorously upscale in-house media production (Netflix originals, prime originals etc) to lower operating fees. 

Netflix has a ridiculous amount of long term debt (not necessarily bad, but important to consider) from fees to lease the rights to TV shows/movies. 

**NOW**. **HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO AMC?**

AMC will host the showing of big movies, like the Avengers etc. Movies that will ONLY be in cinemas and NOT on Netflix. They have priority in massive budget movies which means that they will always have a source of customers, as long as the media industry continues to produce blockbuster movies. 

AS SUCH: AMC can capitalize and sell merchandise, sell a show, an experience, and make money from many other sources instead of just the product (the media) itself (UNLIKE Netflix). That's why, in the long term, assuming the management of AMC doesn't completely go retard mode and COVID does actually go away one day, there will be a large customer base for the business.

Of course, I regretted not keeping them but then I took another ride based on the hype and bought at $324 another 45 shares which I am holding as I am around -85%.

Now, I know that my decision of buying at $324 was solely based on what I read/hoped but I do not know how much of that is factual.

[investorrelations@gamestop.com](mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com)This is the investor relations email for GameStop, email them telling them your full name, the country you're based in, and the number of shares you own and request an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split. An Emergency Shareholder Vote would mean eliminating all synthetic stock and taking leverage away from short-sales and a Reverse Stock Split would cause Citadel and any other phantom shares creators to be stuck holding their losses on their shorts position. This is the quickest way to help end this situation once and for all.

Subject : Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is ----- -----, I am located in ----- and I currently own ----- shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

""The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.""

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://imgur.com/WPLBZGp) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let‚Äôs go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://imgur.com/AgJQqMp) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.üöÄ

The company [reported](https://imgur.com/blojVXA) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.

The [company](https://imgur.com/yhnZZSo) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YouTube Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://imgur.com/ZRQtD3X), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on [R&D](https://imgur.com/5DK8IPa) in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the discounted free cash flow it‚Äôs important to [NOTE](https://imgur.com/m5R4niH) that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the projections to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://imgur.com/jy9opVV) also managed to increase their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://imgur.com/wJ8x2BD) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://imgur.com/z2YDQhh) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YouTube will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of [cohorts](https://imgur.com/SumQGc9).

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad‚Äôs world

But this isn‚Äôt the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://imgur.com/OcOg89t) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://imgur.com/ypuUDWt) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on‚Ä¶

So, let‚Äôs start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/0JTwpv2) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price üöÄ

Guys, next let‚Äôs move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/ZcwoWyP) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate

For the Google Services (which include Search, YouTube & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YouTube keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don‚Äôt really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://imgur.com/2MTh00j) the same capex as in the cash flow projections while for the interest income & other incomes which stood at [almost](https://imgur.com/ru1SwIX) $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://imgur.com/78E0QSN) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://imgur.com/eSnDXEP) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://imgur.com/Bz3AiJx) are my actual price targets‚Ä¶ I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price.

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. üöÄ

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://imgur.com/ZZ9i4sP) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE‚Äôs with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YouTube platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn‚Äôt forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://imgur.com/l6B9Qi0), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://imgur.com/Yjf1Cnh) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://imgur.com/JKn4LIJ) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it‚Äôs safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let‚Äôs start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://imgur.com/1qXT9uv), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven‚Äôt seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock

But, let‚Äôs also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://imgur.com/AVfkNAo). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://imgur.com/T6YxgoP), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://imgur.com/CaBNOHd), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://imgur.com/aCYlMkK) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://imgur.com/Pc53mtL) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://imgur.com/lcKbD0T) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

I have had many bags in my hands throughout my life. Of many types, shapes and colors. The vast majority of them were empty. Others I filled over the years with things I grew fond of, and ended up loving even the bag that contained them. But as a poor person, my bags usually have a pretty basic use: they serve to carry things and in the end they end up empty and forgotten, given their ridiculous price and the huge amount of them that exist.

During the last few days I am living a curious situation: I got a pack of recyled bags that I like. I've been using them for a few days and I'm happy. But people around me keep telling me that my bags are empty and worthless. The pack cost me 3 dollars. But they want me to sell the bags to them for a few cents, because they insist that they are worthless, and that if I keep them my personal economy will lose out. They say they are only looking out for my best interest. And, honestly, if I analyze my new bags... those criticisms seem to be right... after all, they are just colorful bags, like any other. Maybe I should sell those bags.

But what I find so strange about all this... is that no one has ever, ever in my life, been interested in an empty bag in my hands.",2021-02-05 23:25:30

Why silver is the play of a lifetime (Satire),0,ld70u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld70u7/why_silver_is_the_play_of_a_lifetime_satire/,5,1612560187.0,"
Since silver is a tradable commodity you can take deliveries of it. This is important because you need to physically have it to make bullets. 

Why do you need silver bullets? Because werewolf‚Äôs. I think the market hasn‚Äôt priced in the full scale of werewolf penetration into our population. 

Working with basic numbers according to Herodotus there was a large population of werewolf‚Äôs beyond Thrace and across the Ister. Working with some rough estimations for the size of the population in the region the village was maybe around 2,000 people. If we subdivided this excluding non werewolf‚Äôs, there were maybe 400 werewolf‚Äôs present at the time. 

Using some quick calculations, the world population at the time was 150,000 and it is now 7.8 billion that gives us a growth factor of around  52,000%(even bigger than your GME gains) if we add that to the estimated 400 werewolf‚Äôs present. We come to the conclusion of 20,800,00 werewolf‚Äôs alive right now. 

Based on extensive field research from Bubba I have concluded the average werewolf takes 7 bullets to kill completely. If we need to coat each bullet in an ounce of silver. That‚Äôs 145,600,000 million ounces of silver which converts to 9,100,000 million pounds of silver. 

Silver currently trades at 206.51$ per pound. This means 1,879,000,000$  of silver need to be purchased . This is a massive in priced in demand of silver currently.

They currently have approx 5M sq ft green house in TX and 5M in BC Canada as well as several partners in CAD/US/Mex (approx 12M sq ft of growing space).  On top of that, they've been selling to all the major grocery chain (Loblaw, Safeway, Trader Joes, Walmart, Wholefoods, etc. for years).  On top of that, they have decades of experience navigating the regulatory obstacles that is the USDA.

Why is all this relevant you ask?  Why should you give a shit about a vegetable grower who was able survive for 30yrs on razor thin margins (\~3-5%)?  Because they are pivoting to Cannabis and making a splash.  They operate their cannabis division in Canada under the name Pure Sunfarms and have curretly dedicated 2 of the 5M sq ft space to it and able to grow more as necessary.

All numbers in USD

Low 2.07, High 15.05

Q4/FY20 ER expected - My service say 2/16 but they've traditionally released it mid March

&#x200B;

TLDR;

\- Only profitable Public LP in Canada (not squint real hard adjusted ebitda profitable, but actual fcf/net income profitable)

\- Grossly undervalued compared to their peers (by marketcap)

\- Recently came in 4th for retail sales in Ontario only after 1yr of receiving their sales license compared with other LP's having years head start.  They hold the pole position for flower sales (by brand) at OCS online

\- Lowest cost producer (can grow at \~.45/g and all in cost around .60/g)

\- CEO/founder owns about 13%+ of all the shares

\- Large LPs (like ACB) have pretty much given up on growing in bulk and buying from them wholesale b/c it's cheaper

\- Already have US presence

Profitability

Check any LP on ycharts and you can see most LPs have been losing money since day 1 compared with VFF.  It's patently absurd how poorly these companies are run.

Given all the money losing companies, we have (from YHOO finance):

Sales Performance

\#1 dried flower on ocs online[ https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication](https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication)

Again, all this only after 1yr of receiving their sales licenses.

Lowest cost producers

As noted, they had to survive for years on razor thing vegetable margins so they've learned a thing or two about growing things cheaply.  While other LP's were spending millions/billions building/acquiring space, VFF quietly and efficiently converted their existing greenhouses for growing cannabis with the single goal in mind of producing it as cheaply as possible realizing that cannabis is just another commodity.  They've since stopped publishing their costs to produce for competitive reasons but left it last year in the .4-.5/g range and recently said they feel they could do it much cheaper based on tech advancements and picking out strains.  To punctuate their commitment to low cost operation, they have their own power plant recycling methane from a nearby dump site and converting it into power.  A recent comment by the CEO said that the nearest competitor spends roughly 2x more to produce 1g of cannabis.  That is huge!

CEO owns about 10M shares of the 75M shares outstanding.  First, 75M shares outstanding (about 65M float) is peanuts compare to the to others (maybe a little off given some <cough> ACB <cough> like to dilute every other week)

APHA - 317M

CGC - 374M

ACB - 160M (after a 12:1 reverse split else they'd be 2B+)

TLRY - 160M

So CEO owns about 13% of the company and is therefore majorly aligned with shareholders.  The management is top notch only diluting when absolutely necessary and aren't writing down 10's of millions/billions of assets like these other guys.

Wholesaler

As it turns out, being able to grow at low cost not only gives you the ability to dictate market prices in the retail channels (their products are generally the lowest prices around and they're still able to make a profit), but it affords them the opportunity to uniquely dominate the wholesale channel.  In fact, wholesale made up roughly 50% of their revs last Quarter!  As noted, ACB has all but given up on growing their own weed favoring buying it on the wholesale market (from VFF) b/c it's actually cheaper for them?  Huh?

US Presence

Let's face it, the US market will be YUGE.  If Canada, with it's 35M inhabitants, is projected to be a 5-10B market, you can multiply that by at least a factor of 10 for the US with its 350M peeps.  Everyone and their brother is vying for a spot there.  VFF already has a 5M sq ft greenhouse in TX and has said that they can enter the market once the States Act is passed.  Guess what?  Congress is currently working on that to make it a reality:[ https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/)

On top of which, they have a small investment in a company working the ASIA market.  I actually think this will be another dominant market consider how much these guys smoke (where do you think all the cigarette revs are coming from these days now that the it's no longer hip to smoke in the US?)

That's too bad but its not over. The classic saying ""you only lose if you sell"" is 100% correct here.

First off, I'm not advocating to hold for the squeeze as at this point, who know if it will ever be squoze. Until the report comes out next week, its guess work at this point and will only be an educated guess as they'll be old figures when they are released.

I'm holding and I'll be buying more (averaging down) for a longer term investment.

GME 15 @ $240
AMC 40 @ $13

So, what do we know is true?

There's a report coming that will release figures of shorts potentially covered next week.

Everyone's reporting ""Game over for GME"". Why would that be reported if it were over?

GME have hired Amazon Execs to up its E commerce.

The people have backed GME and AMC. This is massive, you can buy reputational advertising for the billions the hedge funds lost and people will want a piece of the action once this is over. It only increases how viable it is for investment long term.

There memes for this whole escapade were worth the giant red figure thats keeping eye contact with while it takes a massive wank all over my profits.


So please don't be defeatist. It's demoralising seeing a big red in the account but everyone can come back from this.

Grab your bootstraps and average down as much as you can and maybe it will pop, if not, it's looking more and more a viable investment after all this exposure,  so average down keep! And keep investing over the next year and earn those long term tendies!!

Hold, buy more on the dips and see what happens!

God speed you beautiful apes.

Diamond hands baby!

Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.

There‚Äôs an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out‚Ä¶ Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further ‚Äúbreaking the squeeze.‚Äù

\*\*

To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can¬†[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

*‚ÄúTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*‚Äù

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks¬†‚Äúhelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because the shares were never properly located‚Äù, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry‚Äôs (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren‚Äôt really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to ‚Äúcover‚Äù short positions that they shouldn‚Äôt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.

For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

\*\*

Excerpt:

The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

\*\*

Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be $122 ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don‚Äôt have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.

With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

This stock was over $300 and everyone was standing strong and ""HOLDING THE LINE üöÄüöÄ"" waiting for the moon with no actual exit strategy or real definitive concept of where the moon actually is. You guys took a stock of a company in a dying industry with a market cap of under $1bil, inflated it to $40b, and still were waiting for the moon. What would happen if it hit $1,000? I doubt everyone would post ""WE HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON, EVERYONE GET OFF NOW!"" Everyone would still be saying DIAMOND HANDS MOOOON HERE WE COME like puppets while the millionaires are silently cashing out.

Why can't people accept the simple fact that a 5,000+ percent increase in a borderline worthless stock IS LITERALLY MILES BEYOND THE MOON? A lot of people got in at $300 so maybe they didn't get to experience the take off from Earth, but you need to realize how cheap the stock was just weeks ago. I saw some people say that the stock could go up to $5,000 which is literally impossible. How can anybody even think that a subreddit can drive a company up from $1 billion to $500 billion? That would make it a top 10-15 company in the world... a company with a dying future. That is not even remotely possible.

The reality is that most of the big boys will always be selling the stock at the top while you all hold the line. You all work together to drive the stock price up, but also ignore the fact that if it takes all of you to drive the stock up to $400, it's going to crash once everyone decides to cash out and MANY of you will be left without your retirement funds. In order for the stock to even go from $350 to 400, people have to keep buying at those high prices. But if even 10% of you start selling off, all of those people who bought in late will get fucked. You guys cannot all profit no matter how hard you work together.

Please do some real due diligence and understand what you are investing in for the future, and ALWAYS have an exit strategy.

# Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze (Feedback requested)

I  know you guys are probably sick of hearing GME related stuff but I  really wanted to post this here to get some additional thoughts/feedback  from experienced investors.

Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.

TLDR:  Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if  they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version  below.

There‚Äôs an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First  way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby  driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the  float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively  lower levels.

\*\*

Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:

Plummeting  short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words,  could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the  longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the  longs got out‚Ä¶ Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares  did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for  the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the  same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling  into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have  nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

However  the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short  interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate but instead they played a trick  to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further  ‚Äúbreaking the squeeze.‚Äù

\*\*

To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:

The  way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they  covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery  in the options market.

The tactics  involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk  alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.

The  SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and  Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out  Obligations.‚Äù You can¬†[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

* If  short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or  scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an  appearance of having closed their short position through the use of  deceptive options trades.
* A  hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî  meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call  options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously  buy shares against the call options.
* The  shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as  sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of  the options trade.
* This  works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer,  the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked  shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under  the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect  themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As  a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls  was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic  share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but  wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the  other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker,  so the market maker can hedge.
* The  hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought  back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they  actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out  against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the  maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they  bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But  the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like  they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and  can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes that  exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked  shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation  (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

*‚ÄúTrader  A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling  deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call  sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the  broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that  resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the  circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering  shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*‚Äù

\*\*

In  short (no pun intended) these tricks¬†‚Äúhelp hedge funds maintain short  positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because  the shares were never properly located‚Äù, which triggers alarm bells when  we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver  Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry‚Äôs (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en))  about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to  actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These  factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren‚Äôt really covered  but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using  options, in order to ‚Äúcover‚Äù short positions that they shouldn‚Äôt have  had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

Separately  but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday  reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a  day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed  therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated  113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this  new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122%  short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding  synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against  standard practice.

For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

\*\*

Excerpt:

The  real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure  is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain  everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So,  by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares  (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100,  short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs  whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short %  would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing  this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short %  of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short  of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side  of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45  as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the  normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

\*\*

Many  have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs  interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated  most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved  much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be $122 ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755))  of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the  calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement  tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)),  which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short  percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated  by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that  is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of  55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on  Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I  cannot conclusively say as I don‚Äôt have the evidence to conclusively  make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all  other data points.

With the  possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if  you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would  recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an  emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as  calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all  synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds  participating in fraudulent activity

Freedom is the highest good. In dark times of history, it was ALWAYS about freedom. Freedom of the masses. Over the last 100 years, it was our freedom - the freedom of the people - that was harmed by greedy fat cats of wall street.

The internet is a tool for free speech and for information flow. In theory, the internet is a network that enables a change from information control to a free flow of information. Because of fake and controlled media, however, the internet is still a place where our freedom is violated - constantly.

The last couple of months, weeks, and especially days showed one thing:

**THE FAT CATS ARE SCARED**

If entitled fat cats are cornered, they become dangerous. They will try everything to maintain their entitled status quo and keep the ""wind of change"" from blowing - even if that means BREAKING THE LAW.

This, however, does not change the fact, that they are cornered! The sweet smell of a revolution hangs in the air. And there is NO PLACE where they can go. We got them!

We can do this! We can democratize investing. Power to the people.

The only thing we need to know now:

**TIME IS ON OUR SIDE**

The second only thing we need to know:

**WE GET BIGGER AND THIS IS BIGGER THAN US**

We will build a prosperous future for all of our children. We will change the world for good.

So enjoy your day - do something nice. Drink a cup of tea and do not get nervous.

Subsequently, as intended or not a large change in volume on that stock has occurred.


Legality

What legal implications exist for the individual, moderators and/or the platform (WSB) participating in such activity?


Ethics

Inherently, I do not think what occurred here is unethical behavior.  However, I do think that we should closely examine the intentions of those proliferating sentiment on an exponential scale.  If they're doing it because they want to profit off of manipulating the masses (evil) then they might perform the same exact actions as someone who genuinely just likes GameStop (good) and doesn't want to see them ruined by hedgehogs.


Do hedge funds do the same things though?  What are their intentions?  

What are you apes thinking?

A Sobering Reflection On The GME Saga,27,ld5zp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5zp1/a_sobering_reflection_on_the_gme_saga/,23,1612556310.0,"A Sobering Reflection As The GME Saga Settles

With last week‚Äôs craze of GME is starting to settle, I wanted to write down some of my thoughts and learnings as someone relatively new to this. I initially intended for this to be a way for myself to reflect, but at the end of writing I thought why not share it if it means it could help someone in a similar situation. This post may be quite long so get comfortable, but first, a little background‚Ä¶

I‚Äôd like to think of myself as your average newbie investor, a recent newcomer to the game with no previous experience of investing since it was never taught to us at school. Being 24 years old with a steady job I manage my day to day finances closely ensuring a good amount of disposable income that I can use as I see fit with a good chunk of it split to ensure a comfortable future. Over the past couple of years I‚Äôve racked up a decent amount of savings and even had a savings pot for some ‚Äúon the whim‚Äù purchases, but amongst lockdowns and towards the end of last year my need for spending was at it‚Äôs lowest, which is exactly the point where I was targeted with advertising for all sorts of investing apps that made it out how easy it is to make my money work for me.

So I thought, why don‚Äôt I make my money work for me?

I was cautious setting off at first, only putting in a small chunk of my ‚Äúon the whim‚Äù savings to buy some stocks in companies that I was familiar with; British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, and a Vanguard S&P500 ETF. While they might not have been the most optimal picks, they were ones that I was at ease with knowing that my money would be relatively safe with potential to rebound from the lows of the pandemic. I committed to putting in a set amount each month into my investment account and slowly growing my portfolio.

I did want to educate myself more though, was I doing the right thing? Were these stocks ones that were going to make my money work for me?

Of course, I hit up Reddit and quickly found subs like r/Stocks, r/Investing and r/UKPersonalFinance. This is the point where I was truly overwhelmed with information and how to set up my investment portfolio to suit my goals. It was welcoming to see how many people there were willing to help, but it seemed like for every suggestion made there was a contradiction to it, after all I wanted to have the best portfolio that would guarantee me a millionaires retirement‚Ä¶ A feat I quickly found out was not as easy as some made it out to be.

From that point on I was glued to my trading app and Reddit, my screen on time during the day went from a couple of hours to a distressing 10 hours at its peaks. I was changing my portfolio every couple of days and I will admit that I was addicted to seeing green across all my stocks. The moment a stock started dipping into the red I would sell it and look for the next ‚ÄúHot‚Äù opportunity, sometimes changing stocks multiple times in one day. I was day trading without knowing what that even was yet.

This is where r/WallStreetBets comes into play, a sub that I stumbled across when it spilled over into conversations on the other investing forums, it so happened that I joined just at the time when Palantir was getting all the hype and was still under $20. So many people liked this stock and after reading some of the posted DD I thought to myself, hey this seems like a good thing to put into my portfolio and balance it out with a high risk high reward investment. So I bought a few shares at around $18 and after only a couple of days I saw it grow rapidly like I haven‚Äôt seen from any of my stocks before, I was hooked! Before I knew it my ‚Äúon the whim‚Äù savings pot read $0, and I tripped down on my stocks in Palantir. After all, the stock was going to $300 right?

For the next couple of days I felt like I was the next warren buffet, my first 50% gain in only a few days was an exhilarating feeling‚Ä¶ Which was quickly followed by a week of the stock going downwards. This was the side of investing that I had not experienced yet, I saw my gains vanishing every day but was reassured by the fact most considered this a healthy pullback. I thought to myself, what if this is the start of the bursting bubble everyone is talking about? So I sold my positions right at the $22 dollar mark which was exactly the point it started to make a recovery. I can‚Äôt lie, I was pretty annoyed with myself but nonetheless I took my profits and promised myself to do better next time.

The next few weeks throughout December I took time to research companies, do my due diligence, and invest in businesses I would be comfortable holding when those red days come. So I assembled my first portfolio which I was genuinely proud of consisting of; Etsy, Pintrest, Curiosity Stream, Romeo Power, Arrival and Apple - collectively these stocks took a 75% share of my portfolio with none taking more than a 15% stake on their own - I split the remaining 25% into two ETF‚Äôs; ICLN, and VWRL. 

This is the point where I left my portfolio as it was for the longest period without any day trading - I repurposed the time I used to use staring at my trading app into reading ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù which made apparent to me the mistakes that I made in the past with entering and exiting positions. I got about half way through the book when I started to notice the Gamestop trend coming along with people saying that this is the next hot thing‚Ä¶

Sure I believed that there was money to be made, but after getting burned with Palantir I was cautious of investing into a very high risk but high reward stock until I was much more knowledgeable. Besides, the money pot of expendable savings has run dry so I couldn‚Äôt fund my journey to the moon anyway. That was until I got tipsy one night and saw that the stock had gone up 200%, I thought to myself, why don‚Äôt I take a chunk of my house savings and put them into the stock? If it was to go up, say, another 200% we could be in such a better position to buy our first house soon and we would even have some money spare to treat ourselves to something nice! 

I woke up the next morning, realising how stupid that idea would have been and dismissed the thought as I watched the stock climb to almost $500 a share over the next couple of days - that could have been my house deposit I thought to myself again. Then came the first pitfall of a dip and I thought to myself that it was for the best that I gave it a miss, could I have trusted myself to get out anywhere near the top? Or would I have crashed out again right at the bottom. Similarly to Palantir, I did not see the hype dying down at all - is this a pullback just like what happened when I crashed out of my first risky investment? Surely the stock will go to $5000 next right?

I drew up on my house savings and decided to put a chunk into Gamestop on the way up from the $190 dip, ultimately, I could put that money straight back after I make my gains so what‚Äôs the worst that could happen, I thought to myself. I got in at around $300 and felt amazingly confident at close with the stock rising to $330, onwards and upwards from here boys! 

I was again glued to my trading app, researching the short % and the pre/after market price fluctuations. Monday was where it started to go wrong but I was feeling confident that it was another dip and it was time to load up before take off. Fuck it, let's sell my ETF‚Äôs, who wants a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù portfolio anyway, so off they went and straight into Gamestop. Tuesday took me by surprise but ‚Äúlook at the way the VW short squeeze happened‚Äù - god I wish I could have told myself to shut up here, but no, that was my mentality and I went ahead and sold some of my core positions to further average down into GME.

Wednesday was just a game of watching my investment tumble off of a cliff, and today came the sobering thoughts after realising what I gave into, which stood against everything that I built up since beginning my journey with investing. This has lead me to spill my words out here, with my Gamestop shares at $247 average. I take this as quite an expensive lesson, but I am very thankful that it is one that will only set me back some months on my savings, and not completely ruin me financially for the foreseeable future. 

My plan? Well I either take my losses here which I really see no point in being -80% down on my investment. So I plan to go back to my original method; leave the shares as they are for now, do some due diligence of my own on Gamestop, see what the company has planned for in the future and if it is worth averaging down in for a very long term investment. Remind me in 5 years I guess?

The hardest part of coming to terms with what has happened was definitely the amount of people labelling others in a similar situation as being holders, and the constant mocking of GME shareholders from some people on this sub. I certainly don‚Äôt like to take things personally but it did get to that point, I wanted to prove everybody wrong and in believing that the stock would skyrocket I was only lying to myself. So the next time you see someone in a similar state to where I was blindly chasing a dream, offer them some words of advice, don‚Äôt shit on their dreams just because they can‚Äôt see a way out at the moment. Some people have gambled away much more than I have here but that is no reason for them or their intelligence to be made fun of, we‚Äôre all here for the same reason and we should all have each others backs both when it comes to gains or losses.

Hopefully I was able to put across how quickly things can fall apart just because of our desire to improve our current lifestyle as quickly as possible and I don‚Äôt think that any one can be blamed for wanting to do this when GME was so widely hyped. For those of you who are still reading, thank you for taking the time to do so, my inbox is open if any of you would like to reach out, I am not a financial advisor nor a therapist but I am always happy to chat with anyone who just needs to get something off their chest.

P.S. I apologise for any spelling errors, it is quite late as I am writing this and I wanted to get it all of while it is still fresh on my mind.

Remember to be kind,

Peace,

They put their millions and billions in the trust of HFs.  Then certain people realized some HFs made a miscalculated bet.  Then the rest of us normies piled in, seeing the same problem.  I forget who mentioned it, but when we were usually playing with their crumbs, they knocked over the whole fucking loaf two weeks ago when GMC closed north of 60 and every call was ITM.

Three days of green dildos, love of a stock, and hurting billionaires was not going to last forever, so the CEO of NASDAQ suggests a need for HFs to ""recalibrate"" for this environment.  The next day, normies are recalibrated to not even have additional access to the product (all while the upper levels could still ~~trade~~ recalibrate.)  The following day, we're slowly reintroduced to the product with limited access.  We get to 325 at close on Friday and celebrate, all the whole shares get worked back to 313.

A week removed and we look around with those restrictions gone.  The hands are still diamond, the apes are still strong, we still like the stock, but we must be punished in the meantime.  Say this sub caused all this chaos and upheaval.  Say we're chasing other short candidates that are short less than 100%.  Say we're chasing some digital dog.  Say we're pumping silver.  Say we need SEC investigation.  Say we need disbanding (makes for a good story line, book version may be better than the movie.)  Enough noise from thousand dollar suits on camera deemed to be reputable, mixed with a few targeted ads, SM campaigns, and reposting of articles, and now we don't control the narrative.

We were winning at a game they accidentally let us play for longer and deeper than intended.  WSB must be sacrificed to the üåàüêª alter.  We know our brethren are stuck at a higher price or may be sitting on a deeper loss, but we remain resolved in purpose.  Perhaps one day, Alpha Centauri, but for now, we're trying to escape the gravity of our situation.  There will be little to no justice for the true bad actors, for they are part of the cogs that turn our economic wheel.  And again, we fucked with *their* money, so why should *they* care?  A business decision was made to be fined millions at a later date than lose a couple more billion in one bad trade, of which we will see little of that settlement.

The upside?  This will happen again.  So long as someone is trying to eek out a little more alpha, there will be another chance to jump on a billion dollar mistake (in your favor.)  They're won't be any new regulations because, face it, those HFs have some congressional bucks in them and enough clout on K Street to keep their system going.  Can't say where and when, but if you find it early, you're looking at some deep fucking value.  Should someone else point it out to you, chances are you're late to the party and should dial back your expectations a little.  And, perhaps next time, we take a little off the table when we're up, or maybe just step back when everyone else offline sounds like an expert on the subject.

It's been a helluva a ride and bumpy as shit, but that's the market.  But you're above terra firma, and that next opening bell for the world's largest casino is just around the corner.  Perhaps Melvin & company is still short or even reshorted, or a whale could come in and acquire a bulk of the outstanding shares.  We can dream big while grounded in our reality.

Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze,296,ld5rd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/,24,1612555365.0,"Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. (This is a re-post, if you previously saw this I would appreciate an upvote for visibility. The previous post got a lot of traction but was removed a mod. I spoke to mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve it.)

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.

There‚Äôs an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out‚Ä¶ Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further ‚Äúbreaking the squeeze.‚Äù

\*\*

To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can¬†[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

*‚ÄúTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*‚Äù

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks¬†‚Äúhelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because the shares were never properly located‚Äù, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry‚Äôs (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren‚Äôt really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to ‚Äúcover‚Äù short positions that they shouldn‚Äôt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.

For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

\*\*

Excerpt:

The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

\*\*

Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be $122 ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don‚Äôt have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.

With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

I know this is very hard to digest guys, but please remember that in the markets, you are in for yourself, not for wallstreetbets, not for anybody. There is a saying: there are no friends in wall street.

Holding now, thinking that it will be just like VW in 2008 is insane, the VW dip was caused by shorts! This is why the squeeze in VW even happened. 

Short interest in GME is at about 50%, which is not bad, but most of the shorts now are probably shorts that shorted after the original shorters bought back, meaning that these shorts are in the money right now.

Also, GME is recovering a bit as a company, going into ecommerce, getting Ryan on board, but even the current price 60$ is not justifiable for a company such as gamestop.

If you need the money, I would highly suggest you sell, but if you want to be a retard and let your 30%, 40%, 50% loss get into a 90% loss, you might as well do it.

I personally didn't invest in GME, and I am not shorting it right now, but beware of people shaming you for selling ""paper hands"", ""weak hands"", don't be shamed into losing your money.

Then we strike. We can buy way more at a cheaper rate. Just like Mark Cuban said. We need Volume. We will obtain that by buying cheap. This is exactly what we needed. Also more interest from the avg buyer at a cheaper rate. Nuff said. Shhhhhhh,2021-02-05 21:54:15

What if the broker restrictions backfire on the shorts?,71,ld5hct,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5hct/what_if_the_broker_restrictions_backfire_on_the/,23,1612554234.0,"So, I am a long-time WSB lurker and low-functioning autist with an idea I wanted to share.

&#x200B;

In my understanding, a squeeze started on 26 JAN and the hedge funds started to hemorrhage cash at an alarming rate. They had no choice but to pull out all their dirty (read: illegal) tricks to avoid the full squeeze so they got RH (and all the shitty brokers) to limit buys so they could get price down and do some covering.

At that time a lot of the üßªü§ö who bought in late folded as they were going to anyways (no hard feelings to them, to each their own), leaving them with the realized loss and only leaving the üíéü§ö standing. Although some shorts were covered, it seems like there were other short sellers waiting to jump in. So, in theory, maybe Melvin did bail (at a multi-billion loss) and the next hedgie asshole stepped in to short.

Here's the thing though, the **broker restrictions actually did block a lot of us from buying in more at the peak thus leaving us with more ammo to buy in now**. I was late to the game, and a very small fish in the pond, but most of my position was purchased after restrictions were lifted.

It seems like the hedge funds planned on playing the long game assuming they can scare us into selling but I think **we're in for the longer game**. The way I see it:

&#x200B;

* I am happy to hold an unrealized loss if it's still costing some asshole who's still shorting
* Even if üßªü§ö did hand some of the money back, it's very clear hedge funds did eat big losses already and that feels good
* Who knows what the real short interest really is, but I've got all the time in the world to wait and see if there is still a squeeze to be squoze
* We protected the company from bankruptcy and retail employees from Wall St. predators
* Happy to give the new CEO a chance to turn around the company of my childhood
* Feels good to be a part of a populist uprising of sorts against these assholes
* Hoping we get something out of this, like more decentralized financial infrastructure

&#x200B;

For those of you who bet your retirement on this, I wish you luck! I will be among the many holding strong for the long-long game, you can count on us.

Hi,
My name is xxxxxx. I live in xxxxxxx and I currently own approximately ####### shares of GameStop. I also am a recent PowerUp Member who joined to show my support of Ryan Cohen. I am very excited by his vision of the company as well as the three recent additions to GameStop. My family are also long time, loyal Chewy customers.

I am concerned by the recent market activities to restrict the rights of current and potential GameStop investors. It is quite apparent that brokerage firms and clearinghouses have taken actions that are damaging to shareholders. I request that an emergency shareholder vote be held to accelerate the changes to the board and nominate Ryan Cohen as the chairman of the board.

I would also ask the Board to address the potential fraud occuring in the market and identify legal strategies in consultation with the SEC to eliminate potential naked short selling and synthetic long shares. It is unacceptable that companies are trying to bankrupt GameStop. I believe it is the Board's responsibility to protect GameStop shareholders.

Thank you.",2021-02-05 21:42:24

GME is still an incredibly shorted stock and with the buying power we have we can somewhat mimic what we originally did with GME. 

If the hedge funds knew they were in the clear and that the squeeze had already happened there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for so much market manipulation this week. They are not in the clear yet. They still haven‚Äôt covered most of their short positions because some of us aren‚Äôt selling. They are trying to drive down the price as much as possible before the 9th when the shots reports are released, so before then we should take this as an opportunity to buy shares at a discount price (only if you can). I reckon the price will go up after the 9th but it‚Äôs more likely to do so if we buy up the shares now.

Hedgies are screwed if they can‚Äôt buy their positions back before the 9th. Lets make sure it stays that way.

There is 8 million of us. Let that sink in.

One Thing Billionaires Don't Have: An Ear to the Ground of the American Public- A GME Bull Thesis.,166,ld5edv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5edv/one_thing_billionaires_dont_have_an_ear_to_the/,25,1612553885.0,"One thing that  billionaires don't have that has been proven time and time again. And that is an ear to the ground of the general public.  This is winded, but worth a read as it's a minority thesis.

I am not a financial advisor, I am not a finance person.  I am nothing more than a low stakes poker player with a mere BA in Economics.  And this is not financial advice.  It's simply my thesis and my play.

I was aware of the theory of GME when it was around $11.  I had no clue if it was real or not. I saw the 140% short.  I honestly thought it was a mistake or something.  After, GME dipped from $20 to $16, I was about to throw a few bucks in and see where the Cohen theory went, and if a squeeze happened great. But, then the capital attack happened and I was concerned and was sitting on 90% cash.  So I pulled to my bank till after Jan 20th.  Then, after I re-deposited and behold, GME is at like $50-60. Well damn, so I felt I had missed the boat.

Then something happened, GME rocketed to $120, and all the talking heads on TV started to squirm, billionaires were on TV comparing reddit to cop killers from the capital attack.  The gears of the elite machine started to turn and I called my buddy and said, you know what, it's real, this mfer is going to moon, their borrowed to the fucking gills, maybe even more than we realize. So I looked at my financial situation and chose an amount to put to work on this and decided to dollar cost avg in.  The next day we got a $73 dip. I was in.   We rebound off $73, and then Elon tweets on a move up when GME was $149, it opens the next morning at $260.  That really sucked Mr. Musk, thanks.   So I have skin in the game and am not prepared to make any more moves after that kind of move up. So I wait and watch.  We get a few small dips and I dip a few more dollars in before this thing moves to the stratosphere.  Still only approx  15% in at this point.

Que GME moving into $400 range.  All the news outlets are starting to talk now, it's on a bunch of stuff, CNBC is trying to ignore it, talking about MSFT moving 3%, trying to ignore the elephant in the room.  Boomers around town start talking about, they are asking me questions about what's going on. But they all say the same thing.....if that gets back to around $50, I'm going to buy some.  GME moves toward $500.  The talking heads can't ignore it anymore, the stock market starts bleeding, their pleading with people to stop, the president is getting asked about it, congress is getting in, my dog is fucking watching the TV to see whats about to happen, the super bowl isn't even being talked about amongst gamblers, the whole world is looking at GME, and boomers are asking if they should buy at $500.  And that is when it hit me.  This could crash the economy.

During this move from $260 to $500, I started to notice trends setting in at $360, $330, and $283. It was really struggling to get over the $360 hump, checked the market cap, $22 billion I think.  I told my friend, I don't think the retail guy has enough money.  A guy on CNBC said maybe friday morning, (ok, so they are going to try to crash the entire market, what price do we have to get to?  40 billion?)  So I looked at what GME is at 40 billion, It's $573 if I remember correctly.   So when we were at 22 billion, I asked myself, where is the other half going to come from, it has to be people with cash, and they are terrified of these prices.  Why would they put the majority stake in at $30k for maybe a 100% return, when a guy with $1000 in takes 11,000%.  The avg joe isn't buying this here, it's going to have to crash before it squeezes, if this isn't the squeeze, and these people up big are going to start taking profits.

To my suprise, it breaks into the $500 range, the markets are literally fucking tanking on positive vaccine news as this thing moves toward that $571 number.  I tell my buddy, this is exactly what I said would happen at these prices. So did I sell, hell no, this thing was about to pop.  Then RH happened.

At first, I went conspiracy level shit and thought did they just fucking stop the economy from crashing by doing something illegal, what is this, communist China?  But then it made more sense, people had borrowed on the margin to push it this high that fast, and RH literally wouldn't have the cash to pay these fucking people, which reinforced everything I am thinking at this point.  Friday closes at $320.  The boomers are all talking GME now as a deal at these prices, but their scared, their old, they have to retire soon.  Que Monday morning Silver.

Monday morning Silver squeeze was not ""put out there"" to divert attention of young people from GME.  It was to divert the boomer to the thing they love most, good old metals.  They pushed an ad campaign to get boomers to think, we havn't missed out, these youngsters are about to push silver to the moon and even if they don't, metals are safe, metals are good for the boomer retirement. So now all the boomers are talking Silver. And that is when I made adjustments to my dollar cost avg'ng. This thing was going to crash, there wasn't enough money to push it over the top without getting cash holders and boomers in. I am a cash holder they needed, I wasn't coming in at $300, the boomer was not with you, and the profit takers were up huge and the pressure was on them.   So I sold at $325, with the plan to double down on the way down to $60, double again at $60,  and then double again at $50, with hopes that the boomer would see $50 as a chance to get in and we would see a bounce off $50.   They moved the silver market nearly 10% Monday, over a 1 trillion dollar market.

Well now it's today.  And guess what.  Boomers are not talking Silver in the streets, their talking GME at $50, cash holders are not talking AAPL, their talking GME, and gamblers are still not talking about the Super Bowl, their talking GME.  Their talking about feeling like they were lied to by the media about Silver.  They heard Cramer tell Reddit to not go for the grandslam, go for the homerun instead, take your profits.  They know the establishment squirmed and they don't squirm over a lame 20 billion loss.  A curtain was almost pulled back, and a lot of people are sure curious about what was behind that curtain at $573.

And what is wall street doing.  Celebrating.  Enjoying it.  Doubling down on puts.  It's Atlanta 28-NE 7 with 3 minutes to go in the 3rd QT in the Super Bowl.  It's over. The billionaire owner is on the sideline waiting for his trophy.

But what if there is a spark.  A tiny bounce off $50.  A dropped pass that gives the ball back to save a glimmer of hope.

Boomer sees price going back up, gambler sees price moving back up, cash holder sees price moving.  Downside, probably 50%, upside huge.  A buy, then another, momentum maybe?  Probably not, some holders see a new opportunity to bail, price falls, and yet another buying opportunity to open the curtain.  Another buy, another buy, no sellers at these levels, they have had 5 opportunities to bail.  Momentum builds. The news starts talking again, rolling their eyes, people start to think, it's happening.  More come in, process repeats, until there is enough momentum, some profit takers start thinking, what if I am wrong, if I put in 50% profits, I've still got 50%.  And to the moon we go to open a magic curtain with something behind it that makes everyone nervous for some reason.

Or, maybe we just crash to $5.

So what I have been betting on is simple.  Wall Street is amazing at this game. But they are not on the street, they don't have their ear to ground. I believe that they played this perfect, just like I expected them to.  And I am betting they have underestimated this and have doubled down again without the knowledge of the talk on the streets, being around regular people, thinking this forum was their biggest threat, and have in the process overextended themselves in the process again.

Do I think they are still heavily shorted.  HELL YES.  Do I think the economy is at risk.  No.  They likely deleveraged enough to remove that option by reducing some of their own risk.  But another $?bn loss is a lot of tendies to go around.

Updated Short Interest Numbers for GameStop (GME) as of Feb 1,17,ld5b8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/,41,1612553505.0,"The 121% short interest that people keep mentioning is from Jan. 15.




Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme, date is seen next to the short interest volume.






According to Bloomberg from Feb 1:






>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering





>Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop‚Äôs short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.








Obviously those are numbers from 2 different market analytics firms so they are not official. NYSE will report official numbers on Feb 9. These Feb. 9 numbers will be the short interest as of Jan. 29 so they won't be as low as the Bloomberg numbers since they're 3 days older (Source: https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf)






**So, as a summary:**








Officially: 121% on Jan 15, new numbers come out feb 9 (but will be the short interest from Jan 29)








S3: 140% mid Jan, 50% as of Feb. 1







IHS Markit: 114% mid Jan, 39% as of Feb. 1









As much as WSB likes to cast doubt on any information against a potential second squeeze, these firms' whole business depends on providing accurate estimates. There is a very good chance the official short interest will be around 39-50%. But note that it may be slightly higher since the data is 3 days older than those estimates. 






**What does this mean?**




Based on the estimates, there is a 60+% decrease in the number of shorts from Jan 15 to Feb 1. This means short-sellers have covered most of their shorts and the chance of another short squeeze occurring is basically 0. If I had to guess, Melvin covered most of their shorts around Jan 26th (which is when it was reported that they covered). This caused the price to go from $88 to $150. The majority of other short positions were covered between Jan 27-29 which explains the drastic price increase to $300+. 






According to Reuters: 








>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets-idUSKBN29X1SW?taid=6012f37e9ac87d000147d4e3






>Short-sellers are sitting on estimated losses of $70.87 billion from their short positions in U.S. 









>Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms.





My prediction makes sense with these numbers. Melvin lost $6 billion and were spared from heavier losses due to how quickly they bought to cover. This demand drove the price up and caused most of the remaining losses.













**EDIT:**





**Here is my response to /u/OverlordHippo's comment about the S3 numbers:**





>Except the S3 data was only 54% because they added synthetic longs into their equation this time for (some) no reason. Using the common practice equation it's still well over 100%. If you think Bloomberg is reporting with integrity, well I can't help you there lol






Let's look at the S3 report for Feb 1: https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509




You will see 2 different values for the short interest: 




53.15% SI % Float








34.1% S3 SI % Float





The 53% number is calculated how short interest is typically calculated. S3 did NOT add synthetic longs into this equation. 




The 34.1% number is the number which includes synthetic longs. The managing director of S3 explains the difference between this two numbers and why this is done back in September 2020: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/






**The confusion about S3 stems from this Tweet from Jan 29:** 
https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755





From Jan 29 to Feb 1, traditional short interest went from 113.31% to 53.15%.






And, S3 short interest (the calculation which included synthetic longs) went from 53.12% to 34.71%. 








**People confused the** traditional short interest **of** 53.15% **from Feb. 1 with the** S3 short interest **of** 53.12% **from Jan 29. They thought the traditional short interest used a new calculation when it did not. S3 did NOT change the calculation randomly.**",2021-02-05 21:31:45

I‚Äôm just an ape.**

So this has been going on in the sub, Robinhood and other brokers make money selling data of what their users are going to do, before it‚Äôs available to the users. Aka, preparing for what the retail investors are going to do after the market opens. But how do they know it? Do they read our smooth brains? Nope, not yet, let me explain.

Basically mind reading isn‚Äôt available, yet, so the next best thing is big data. My guess is each time you create sell limits, stop losses, buy orders etc that are not done while the market is open, it sends all the stats to these big players, so their algorithms create what the general consensus is, to prepare their tactics or to fuck over the little guys, like us ape brothers.

In the privacy world some people, like me, love protecting ourselves making that big data useless. But how do you make it useless? Spam the premarket, market or after hours with limits and buy orders that you can cancel (please check this before), so basically you are creating random untrue data that it‚Äôs not really what you‚Äôre going to do kind of data. So they have false information for their predictions.

For example: Wanna buy? Set to sell 2 shares at 600$ with limit orders, but when the market opens cancel that bitch and buy GME like a true ape.

TLDR: If you wanna confuse big data algorithms create orders for things you don‚Äôt intend to do and then cancel them.

- Using buzzwords to try to tie (digital currency) to the Superbowl and Elon Musk



- Massive push on Silver on multiple platforms



- Multiple sponsored articles on sites such as Yahoo saying the ""Reddit Mob"" is now moving into Silver, Nokia, (digital currency) etc



- Implying there is organization and insider trading going on in Reddit



To be clear, I don't actually think most of these are 'bots' per se, as that's overly complex and easy to catch by Reddit servers. I think this is a coordinated [Astroturf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing) campaign by people who are getting paid to post propaganda.

There are some clues in this campaign as to who it was paid for by, as it comments on random articles related to Citadel and their ties to the SEC. All of this is current and ongoing as of the morning of 2/5.

What other evidence have you guys found of this type of Astroturfing? What are their objectives? Can we post evidence?

Being on the wrong end of shorts has a much larger loss potential than just buying a stock. It's why the Hedge Funds frantically spent so much money to try bringing the stock prices down again.

Apologies if this is the 2nd time you've read this. My first post was mysteriously deleted...Big money getting the real info removed?

After having meticulously researched  this sub as to when the shorts expire I have discovered that all of you mostly think it's Friday, so I have a strong feeling it will definitely be Friday like you all said and I trust you. (Putting 74k on GME today)

However, I do feel there's a caveat as I've read it might be next week too so...

If it's not Friday it'll definitely be next Monday or Tuesday...or Wednesday...Thursday? Maybe Friday after next then? If not by then it will definitely be within the week after that, or the month after. Or at the very least within 6 months possibly 12 but could be 10 years...definitely within 25 years though. Conservatively you could stretch that to 50 as a safe bet but to err on the safe side of caution I'll say, by this time in the year 2146, they'll have started covering. 

I'm certain of it.

Who remembers the ending? The despair. 


Everyone had come together, fought their hardest fight, with all their emotion and might. Yet still they lost. Thanos had won, and we witnessed half of the world diminish into a fine dust in the blink of an eye. All hope had been lost and it hit the world hard. It hit deep, it hurts us still. Maybe we are just a bunch of weebs after all, with nothing to our name.


Well, FUCK THAT.


This was only the first fight ladies and gentlemen. Autists and retards - you must understand.  

We took a big loss and beating this week and it has - like the film - seen half of us vanish into the void as if we never believed in the cause. 

And yet, I sit here now - typing with a smile on my face - with hope. 

Because I know that on this day we still stand strong. Sure there may only be half of us left - but we now have our resolve. We are calm, we have clarity. We now know what we're up against. 

It's time to get back on the horse. 

Dr Strange is DeepFuckingValue - he may have foresaw this - but he couldn't tell us all. 

1 in 14,000,000 chance we win this - but we're autistic, so it might as well be 1 in 1 because we can't do math. 

We might lose him too - like the Avengers lost Dr Strange. But in his memory is where we prevail and march forward unto victory. And in memory of the half we have lost - we march forward for them. 

Our lowest point is our defining moment and we now realize that now. The strength that comes from our realization is unmatched and will be fiercer and bloodier than anything the world has seen before. Because when 8 million autists come together and march as one - who wouldn't run from that? 

I come to you now - at the turn of the tide - to remind you all that today is where we pick ourselves up with a new identity.

We will not go quietly into the night. 

We will not vanish, without a fight. We're going to live on, we're going to survive. 

Today - we celebrate our autism day.

Imagine Gamestop has their own set top box CONSOLE and controllers where you can stream 1000s of games for a monthly subscription as well as mobile version and it's all integrated for massive multiplayer online.

Then they could start their own studio like netflix does with movies. With their strategic alliance with Microsoft, hmmm!?

Then they wouldn't need to be symbiotic with all the other platforms. They could make revenue with their own hardware.. it could also have netflix app.. netflix+gamestop.

So with Microsoft alliance they collab on the Xbox games.  With their in-store pc building the get into pc niche.  With esports they'd be locked..  what does that leave for playstation?  Scraps.  Steam?  IDK

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

u/Precocious_Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. ""In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!‚Äù",2021-02-05 20:30:03

Let's have rational approach on GME,100,ld4dbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld4dbt/lets_have_rational_approach_on_gme/,20,1612549380.0,"First, i'm still in 455 shares. Sold some calls during pumps so I already locked in $25k in gains.

So, let's address this. The ""Squeeze"" we've been having IMO is not a short squeeze but a mix of a FOMO rally and *some* shorts covering and shorts opened at the top. We can't deny that. It's not comparable to the dot com bubble because many of those companies really didn't have any value and was purely on speculation. GME's point is to rally so hard to margin call the shorts but RH capped us and screwed us over. Is there still hope? Who knows.

Next, GME has to be a profitable company or show good signs of a turnaround for shorts to realize they've had enough gains/losses and should start exiting in an attempt maybe to short at higher PT. Read the actual DD‚Äîit has always been a value play.

From Chewy wiki:

*Chewy was founded under the name ""Mr. Chewy"" in June 2011 by* [*Ryan Cohen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen) *and Michael Da.The company hired former employees and executives from* [*Amazon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com)*,* [*PetSmart*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetSmart)*,* [*Whole Foods Market*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market)*, and* [*Wayfair*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfair)*. In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year.From 2014 to 2015, sales grew from $205 million to $423 million.*

It's not exactly bananas to bananas but you see a pattern here? Ryan hiring people with experience then building with his team to make a company better? The reason GameStop has been on a decline has **always** been because of bad decisions at the executive levels. If you've ever had the pleasure of working under people with actually good management skills, you'd know they'd mostly succeed wherever they go. You can move, change your job, or enter a different circle of people but you'll **always** bring yourself. A person who can successfully turn around a company after getting rid of the old problems? Bullish.

I'm not telling you to buy or sell, i'm not a financial adviser but jezuz, ya'll acting like everything about this company depends in 24 hours or a week. It will depend on **GameStop** to drive another rally whether with a squeeze or not. Give more attention to the earnings and GameStop's road map rather than SI %. If not a short squeeze play, consider it a boring long investment, your 401ks probably have gone up and down throughout the years but you didn't shit yourself each time right? Relax and let go of the price action.

You will be tempted to sell at lows, you will be tempted to sell highs just to ""break even"". It's your choice whether you can stomach loss, potential gains, or opportunity costs harder, but please, consider the actual company instead of just the price. I got in because I believed the price was just bad sentiment and artificially driven down by over shorting.

Lastly, unless you're not meeting bills, financial obligations, or paying your monthly dues for the backdoor brojob Wendy's, relax. Nothing has changed, the outside world hasn't changed, the ground that you're stepping on hasn't changed, only your perception has changed. Stop day dreaming about massive gains or dreading about massive losses. Have a more stoic approach and a plan.

That being said, I'm glad to have held and cried with you all. Even if it was for just a moment I actually saw a solidarity that didn't care about politics, race, or gender‚Äîonly tendies and each other. You lose, you gain, that's life but life is not only about gains and losses.

TL;DR: Look at other things aside from price action. It's been quite a ride, it's an honor to have been in it. Don't worry so much, your wife's BF will take care of her while you do other things. I'm riding this ship til GameStop develops a cure for cancer.

We are complete idiots wrt to this and do not know how to proceed.

I'm also unsure what the best brokerage (app) is to proceed with, I know RH doesn't let non-americans sign up.

I read somewhere about another Asian who funded his **capital.com** account and lost everything because he was actually trading umm.. CFDs and didn't change the.. leverage settings or something. If this is the case indeed then aren't these brokerages actually making money hand over fist due noobs wanting to get in the GME frenzy?

I feel if there was proper guidance on how international noobs can get started and setup their apps or whatever to hold long then WSB can actually have more people backing them. I for one will make a wiki-style post if I figure how its done.

My main questions are

1. What brokerages are good for Non-Americans?
2. Should we go with CFDs or Options?
3. Can a non-American actually legally even own a stock of an American company listed on NYSE?
4. Is there a basic guidance on account setup so as to not let brokerages dupe us into losing our money?

I'm sorry if asking all this is against the rules, I've searched all morning on reddit and YouTube but I found nothing that clearly explains. Any help will be much appreciated.

I also feel that this battle of GME Vs. Hedge Funds may go on for a little longer than people think and with each passing day many many international folks are going to want to join in with WSB.

It May Be OK If You Bought GME Too High,64,ld49op,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld49op/it_may_be_ok_if_you_bought_gme_too_high/,41,1612548901.0,"Disclosure: 8 shares @ 105.24

While I am a new investor (less than a year), I feel it is important to inform those of you who may not know that the average cost of your shares * your share count is exactly how much you have spent on the stock.

So, if you ended up buying too high, you can buy more at lower and lower prices to drive that average cost down. This is important because it allows you to not lose as much money. It sounds weird but it's true and moves from a YOLO play to a long term hold.

We have to remember that the current real value of GameStop is $33 according to macroaxis. If the shorts continue to bully us down, we'll see prices below that before too long and you can buy the dip.

Consider my position. If the stock falls to $15 for example, then I can buy 100 shares to get an average cost of (8 * 105.24 + 100 * 15.00) / 108 = $21.68 which is below it's real value and so in time I will have recovered my losses.

So, the very worst thing to do is panic sell at a loss. Time has an opportunity to recoup your losses but selling off removes that possibility.

Do you believe GameStop will survive? Maybe even thrive under new business decisions? Then consider averaging down instead of exiting.

I do understand that my position is not that high compared to what some of you others are doing and maybe averaging down is not financially possible at this point, but for those of you who can - don't lose hope so quickly. 

And hey, we might see another epic squeeze soon. History repeats itself and if the bad guys aren't caught, do you think they learned anything?

The phone was still switched on, and had been forgotten about for 20 years.

Incredibly the phone still had just over 70% battery remaining. Kevin remarked how he didn‚Äôt ever remember charging the mobile, or even owning a charger.

Today‚Äôs mobile phones, such as iPhones, have an average battery life of around 17 minutes and require plugging in throughout the day in order to have enough power for the bus or train ride home. The Nokia 3310, however, never required charging. Ever.

Scientists believe that Nokia, rather than make a mobile phone, had instead created renewable energy.

Doctor *Ivor Bignob*, currently teaching at Cheshire College, commented:

>*THE NOKIA 3310 BATTERY IS LIKE PERPETUAL MOTION. IT SHOULDN‚ÄôT EXIST, BUT IT DOES. ONE NOKIA 3310 CAN POWER A CITY FOR ALL TIME.*

Conspiracy theorists believe the Nokia 3310 disappeared because of threats and underhand tactics from fossil fuels, as a battery that never ran out would cripple the fossil fuel industry.

Mr Moody‚Äôs phone is currently serving him well as both a texting device and a spare hammer for when he drops his at work.

I read a post on here that said someone wanted to buy a shirt from the store and they had nothing. It's time for us to change this.

At $25 a shirt, which will cost around $5-6 to produce and fulfill, the company will net close to $20,000,000. And in their last quarterly report GME reported a net income of -$18,800,000, so if you add $20,000,000 doesn't that give you +$1,200,000? 

All it takes is 1 shirt, and of course you see where I'm going with this. What stops GME from becoming the largest merch company for gaming apparel?

We can all make this a reality by emailing George Sherman this post:

george@gamestop.com
george.sherman@gamestop.com
gsherman@gamestop.com

Gap is an 8Bn dollar company. Trust me, I can build this apparel division out to eclipse Gap so we all get quality products with some kick ass designs. 

What has unfolded these past few weeks will be enshrined in history. Some made money, some lost. But the fact is the brand equity is stronger than ever, probably the strongest brand on Earth right now, so if we all mobilize our energy and email George Sherman to make this happen we'll be on our way to increasing the share price.

(Just a reminder there are brokers like Fidelity who have long positions in GME) Over the whole week ladder attacks have taken place to drive the stock price down...could it be the hedge funds setting themselves up to cover for cheaper? There is almost no way mathematically that hedge funds have covered and short interest report on 2/9 could be the final catalyst to trigger the squeeze. However with GME at the low price it is now, it is possible the hedge funds planned for this and bought way OTM calls as a hedge for squeeze. (that way they profit too)

Again I could be completely wrong, and if this doesn‚Äôt happen that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the shorts have not covered and will still be in danger even after 2/9.

Basically in every post the comments explained that the stock would dip for a number of reasons, including RH restrictions and hedge funds pulling sneaky shit to artificially lower the prices. It seemed so obvious that this was going to happen and the plan was to HOLD no matter what (for those who like the stock). It really frustrated me to see everyone panic selling their stock to reduce their loss and actually lower the stock price. 

I am still a believer that the squeeze has yet to come and the hedge funds will get screwed in the end. I am really hoping y'all can pull this off and make some money while you're at it.

Seeing the sub go downhill and making a complete 180¬∞ turn from optimism into chaos and corruption injected a lot of anger and stress into me and a lot of others in the hopes of panic selling. If Robinhood never restricted GME and AMC, those stocks would‚Äôve never bombed, but even with those restrictions everyone was still wearing their losses as a badge of honor and buying billboards, supporting these stocks unconditionally. 


February 3rd comes along and there‚Äôs dozens if not hundreds of bots spreading fear and negativity and encouraging traders to panic sell. The most trusted and most active mods get booted, auto mod gets removed and the whole thing turns into a shit show (and not in a good poop flinging at each other way). The worst part to me is that I know some people actually got convinced into panic selling at a big loss, and I can‚Äôt imagine how devastating that must be some people during a pandemic. Knowing how things were going the day before, people would‚Äôve have been as terrified as they were before the turmoil the bots and MSM caused within this sub. We were motivating each other. We were all memes and emojis and happy to share our loss porn, the community bond was some real shit. Motherfuckers tried to ruin that and scare newcomers into not buying even at such a discount, and scaring others to sell at catastrophic losses (sus as fuck).


Seeing sellouts being called out and seeing loss porn and camaraderie again in this sub fills me with joy.

its pysch tactic...  reciprocity so now that they shown how they can get the price down-here is your escape pod.  they even opened up the flood gates a bit, buy all you want... make you believe that you are in this la la awesome land- but it comes with a catch - they made it known they will do everything plus some to drop the price!

they assume we dont know how pricing works... they assume you dont know what volume means... all they want you to believe is that this is your last chance to get out...

so im bag-holding... if i am right then much of what i made on this position will benefit many

im holding.... not fooled by this tactic...

do as you will... my confirmation bias will be affirmed at market open... again math is a friend..... if they are shorting they need it to get to 5 not 30.... furthermore 140% at one point of float.... DAMN   im impressed they could get it to 120% this quick....

As long as the popular opinion is that the stock will fall further, it is hard to assume that the shorts have covered.

Now that is over, I‚Äôd like you to remind what to do in case this repeats itself. 

Yes, it‚Äôs over, the short squeeze was from 40 to 500, get over it. 


Lesson 1:  Don‚Äôt trust other people regarding to investing, do your own DD before going balls in on a stock. Even if they say it can go 500$ more.  Nobody knows that. 

Lesson 2: Diversify, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. 

Lesson 3: take profits along the way, at least the initial investment. No one has gone broke by taking profits. 

Lesson 4: set up an stoploss to the maximum you can afford to lose, I got in at 340, sold half at 400, then sold the other half at 290. This saved me from bankruptcy.

Lesson 5: This ain‚Äôt the fucking titanic, if the ship is sinking, you jump out, look at the bigger picture, if it‚Äôs starting to float again, go for it, but be ready to jump out again.

Lesson 6: Don‚Äôt take out loans or use other peoples money to gamble in the internet.

Lesson 7: there‚Äôs a loss flair in this reddit for a reason, enjoy being part of it. Learn from it.

Lesson 8: don‚Äôt use $ROPE, start investing in other companies long term. Do hours of DD and you‚Äôll come out as a winner:

Lesson 9: suck a sick.

The Drop in GameStop Short Interest Could be Real ‚Äî Or Deceptive Market Manipulation (breakdown of how this is possible),43,ld3i7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld3i7d/the_drop_in_gamestop_short_interest_could_be_real/,7,1612545450.0,"Hey everyone. Happened across this article today and want to know if there is any veracity to it. Thoughts?  

&nbsp;

[https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/)  

&nbsp;

Here is the real meat of the article:  
 
&nbsp;
   
""But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate.  
 
&nbsp;
   
If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.  
 
&nbsp;
       
That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.  
  
&nbsp;
   
In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short ‚Äî with tens of billions of dollars on the line ‚Äî could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.  
 
&nbsp;
   
The trick would be: ‚ÄúMake it look like we‚Äôve covered our shorts when we really haven‚Äôt (because we can‚Äôt), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.‚Äù  
 
&nbsp;
   
The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.
The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.  
 
&nbsp;
   
The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù [You can read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).""  

&nbsp;
    
And this part:  

&nbsp;

""The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:  
 
&nbsp;
   
- If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.  
 
&nbsp;
   
- A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.  
 
&nbsp;
   
- The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.  
 
&nbsp;
   
- This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.  
 
&nbsp;
   
- As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.  
 
&nbsp;
   
- The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.  
 
&nbsp;
   
It gets very complicated, very fast.""",2021-02-05 19:17:30

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y‚Äôall ask the same god damn questions

- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it‚Äôs my biggest holding. It‚Äôs the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world‚Äôs most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don‚Äôt give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I‚Äôm buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

Sell out or not? Remember what is real!,20,ld3gs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld3gs4/sell_out_or_not_remember_what_is_real/,10,1612545255.0,"This isn't financial advice. I'm way below dumb ape understanding. If you read to the second paragraph, then please read to the end.

If you don't spend more than you are willing to lose, then you don't feel the pressure to cut your losses. But maybe you did.

Maybe any potential loss isn't something you need to overly worry about. ask yourself:

* How long would it take to earn at my day job the money that I could get from selling out? 

* Could I earn that even before this all ends?

* Will selling out even nearly cover my cost? Enough to make a difference?

* How does losing 90% instead of 100% compare with my reason for buying?

* If I lose my investment, what practical difference will it make?

If you did spend more than you can afford, then get help, talk to someone you trust. Maybe have a backup person. Start with: ""I've been silly"". Many people make such mistakes. It doesn't have to define you. Start from where you are now, and remember that most of what you do is OK. It's going to be fine.

Don't do anything rash, don't do anything illegal. If you are in trouble because of hasty action then you do need advice. Don't compound any mistakes you may have made. 

I hope no-one has spent the days takings on GME instead of depositing it in the company account, but if you have - it can be put right (it may be hard) but don't make things worse.

Remember that the balls are still in the air, and that there are people who love you more than money, and more than revenge. Maybe you need to go out and find those people - so then do that.

Maybe you need to take a break, even a few hours, to get in touch with things that are or have been more real to you for a while, to find your bearings. Maybe you need to do that every day.

And if it all fades away, maybe in a year or two you could receive delivery of the share certificates and frame them as token gifts, or mementos of today.

With any luck and a favorable wind, these heady days won't be the major days of your life.

And we don't yet know how the balls will land. 

Apes stronger together applies all over life, not just for GME. Do good. Be men. Be steady on what is real. 

Peace, guys!

I mentioned a few of these points in the daily once or twice but I think they need to be pointed out again. 

Ryan Cohen isn't going to buy another 7% of his stake when the share price is $400. He might however top up with the share price under $50. That is probably the most bullish thesis for a low share price. If he locks up another 7% of the float you would almost have to be more retarded than WSB to hold a short position.

I dont have Twitter but someone mentioned that Cohen also just starting following DFV of Twitter so you know damn well he is keeping a close eye on what's going on. 
If I'm Cohen (and the rest of the board tbh) watching what is happening, I've got a shit eating grinn on my face the size of your wifes after her boyfriend is done with her. 
Why? 
Because us smooth-brained retailers (customers)  just served up an opportunity on a s_lv_r (fill in the vowels, I don't want to hear CNBC shilling the fucking commodity for another week) fucking platter.

Be another good squeeze potential and b.) Solidify their business among retailers (customers) for years to come (sort of like Elon did with Tesla).  
Win for investors by straightening out this shorting bullshit, and win for them by gaining life long, loyal customers. 

Too many people get caught up in the PRICE of the stock, and not at the MARKET CAP of the company. I would argue right now that with expectations high for the quarter, a new console super cycle, Cohen and his posse on the board, the new C.T.O (ex AWS engineer), and pending transition into digital, that the stock is definitely UNDERVALUED at a current Market Cap of 3.7bil. Check out GMEDD.COM for more info!

It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers,9602,ld2zlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld2zlq/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/,716,1612543033.0,"Posting again because last one got removed for some bullshit about a ticker name I wasn‚Äôt even referring to. 

Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen? 

It‚Äôs simple. Let‚Äôs use the worst possible numbers here. 

Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let‚Äôs say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short. 

Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let‚Äôs say they covered at 300. You‚Äôre telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we‚Äôre still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would‚Äôve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover. 

Hold your fucking shares.

Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.

Edit 2: I know I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised you retards don‚Äôt understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking **ZERO**. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= *-$45* Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I‚Äôm getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money. 

Please get your head out of your ass. **if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.**",2021-02-05 18:37:13

They cancelled buy orders and added stop loss orders that were quickly gutted. This resulted in prices collapsing, and ultimately was market manipulation. This isn't just lost unrealized and realized gains, this also destroyed the value of calls I could have sold against my position once it hit my price target, so the losses go beyond just the stock value. I also suspect they were tipped off that shares were going to be sold, and I think people traded based on this inside information.

The call was brilliant by DFV but the momentum is killed long ago, the squeeze happened (5 to 500, 10.000%), once the hedgies figured out what we wanna do couple weeks ago - as we literally made all our steps public - they got one step ahead of us. We tried to defeat them on their own domain, with much lower capita. Melvin probably exited their shorts with a huge loss around 80-150 usd on 27/1, that drove the price up, and around the 350+ range where other investors with long positions could surely exit with big gains. Then the hype peaks causing more retail buys, also people looking at the short interest data from 15/1 which is long outdated... The only shorts there are is the ones entered on a high (200+) price point and they sure as hell fine there with the current pricing. 

If they don't do their broad range of trickery (shutting retail brokers, media narrative manipulation, etc.) it probably would have gone up more but they wanted to shut it down, and guess what, they probably even made some nice money on it.

Fintel updated the way Short Volume is calculated,32,ld2n56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld2n56/fintel_updated_the_way_short_volume_is_calculated/,8,1612541398.0,"Hello fellow retards,

I will start off with saying none of this is financial advice, I can't even afford Excel.

That said, yesterday I copied the data from both Quandl(Data from Finra) and Fintel, just to see if they correlate and what percentage of trades are done through Finra registered traders. In the end it didn't seem to be relevant, or was prone to confirmation bias.
The only thing I noticed was that the % of trades through Finra increased steadily after the initial rush last week.
Here's the full graph:  
https://i.imgur.com/rCfv3Pw.jpg

So an hour ago I decided to update the graph with 04.02.21 values, and apparently Fintel just updated the way they calculate their Short Volume. Here are all the relevant links for the numbers:  
https://www.quandl.com/data/FINRA/FNYX_GME-FINRA-NYSE-TRF-Short-Interest-GME  
https://www.quandl.com/data/FINRA/FNSQ_GME-FINRA-NASDAQ-TRF-Short-Interest-GME  
https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

This is where it gets interesting:  
https://i.imgur.com/ATe9Tyl.jpg

As you can see, the Short Volume Ratio increased massively over the last few days according to the new info, up to 69% (nice) on 04.02.21.  Notice also how big the difference gets with each day: from 20% last monday to 45% this tuesday.  
(Don't have old numbers from Fintel for 02.04, but they would be around 13-14 million as the Finra data)

Now I am just a smooth-brained ape, but I thought this was pretty big considering how much their updated short volume changed. The way Fintel got their Short Volume numbers before correlates to Short Volume from Finra, but now the total volume they show is much higher.

A bit of a PSA before I proceed.

Do you know what YOLO means? Not the word but the intent behind the word? It means taking that 20K your old man left you when he died and putting it all on GME. It does not mean draining your life savings and ruining your marriage, your financial future, and so much more. You can absolutely be a retard with your money and not be a giant fucking idiot. You're not an investor if you do this. You're a gambling addict.

Now if you did this, and you're really that much of an idiot, all may not be lost. The best thing to do is to hold and pray for a squeeze. If not maybe you can hold onto it for a year or two and recoup a large portion of your losses if the stock goes up. But either way you need to acknowledge that you're a fucking idiot and shouldn't be anywhere near large sums of money and the stock market.




Now out of all the posts here giving non advice, one thing they all fail to mention. At the end of the day, it comes down to speculation. They speculate the stock is going down. They speculate it's going to go up. They speculate these are ladder attacks.

Nobody knows for sure what is going to happen, when, and how much it's going to drop/rise. 



Final Stretch.

As we have seen, since the initial squeeze, the price has been steadily declining. So did we already get the big squeeze and it's all over or are we looking at another? The original jump to $400 I believe was a combination of short covers and reddit mania/retail buying. But not all the shorts were covered. These HFs can say they took billions in losses. But they don't tell you that they actually haven't cashed out those losses. They are waiting. Most of them have way smarter people than you and I(and likely don't mind breaking the law). What appears to be happening according to every ape on WSB that can screenshot a graph, is that they are applying a combination of selling shorts and ladder attacks. They are doing this to drive down the price while also making money in the process. With the amount of interest from reddit and every other retail investor, there is no way these HFs are not throwing in every penny they can to get that price down. Getting normies to paper hand is just a bonus.

And what happens when they get that price down? They are going to cover their shorts for minimal losses. MAYBE even come out with a profit. The legality of what is going on is beside the point. And what happens when they stop the ladder attacks and stop shorting, AND cover their shorts? Another huge jump in stock price. But when? The day before we find out how much short the stock really is. Why? Well, if everyone finds out they still have billions of shorts to cover, it's going to be a mad dash to buy as many of the stocks as people can before they cover. Then we will definitely know we are in a squeeze. They don't want that, so they are going to keep driving down the price and making money on more shorting before they cover their asses. And, in their mind, hope that the losses will be minimal. This would also explain the bailout by Citadel. They needed money to keep trading with to make their money back.

First of all, we're all retarded here so that doesn't need to be pointed out

Second of all, I feel like a lot of the üíéüëê posts are just being fueled by bullish speculation while the posts callin out the dumbass üíéüëê are fueled by speculation in the other direction (imagine being üåàüêª lmao)

While I am still holding, and probably gonna buy more when it dips below 40, I do think that there is merit to both arguments. Just not when it's being backed up with speculation

Speculation:
+ price is gonna go up cuz of feb 9 short report!!
+ price is gonna go up cuz restrictions are gone!!
+ price is gonna go up cuz maybe papa elon or mama chamath will drop money on it!!

- price is going down cuz the squeeze already happened at 400!!
- price is gonna go down cuz the shorts have already covered!!
- price is going down cuz all the üßªüëê fucked it for everyone!!

The point is all of these arguments are based on speculation and completely useless

Nobody knows how the short float report or the lifted restrictions is gonna affect the stock

Nobody knows whether the squeeze really did happen at 400 because the brokers fucked the momentum for the stock

Nobodt knows if the shorts have covered because the report hasn't even been posted yet and the last one was recorded up until Jan 15

All we know is that there was clear manipulation that completely fucked the stock while it was on its way up

The silver shilling and the news calling Reddit for market manipulation and painting this subreddit as the culprit

The brokers shutting down buying right as it was about to hit $500 before completely tanking it to $120

The SEC ""investigation"" that looked into this subreddit instead of Robinhood or Citadel or literally any other institution that was partially responsible for closing half of the trading system

All we know is that the trade restrictions have been halted and that the price is hitting (or about to hit) a very low and appealling price to people who were bullish on it anyway just based on its long-term fundamentals (Cohen and friends)

We know is that on Feb 9 a short report is coming out that could potentially change traders' opinions on the stock (or 15 idk ive seen that date being thrown around on this subreddit but I can't find a source on it anywhere for the life of me)

And we know that the shares are still FOR SURE being shorted

Whether you guys are bullish or bearish on the stock doesn't change the fact that things are happening behind the scenes and both sides have merit to their argument AS LONG AS IT ISN'T PURELY BASED ON SPECULATION (lookin at you retards tellin ppl to hold the stock cuz feb 9 is gonna be ""the squeeze"")

So next time you guys are about to call someone a retard remind yourself that maybe the autist on the other side of the special needs door might be on to something

Basically if we hold what are there still enough of us to make this work?

     First off, sorry for the poor structure I‚Äôm on mobile. 
Second disclaimer, I‚Äôm an idiot, full blown ape holding onto 1/4 of my hard earned 100% return in 8 long months of investing. 

     I‚Äôm going to hold until Cohen takes game stop to the levels we know it can reach. 

     Also because these üíéü§åüèª won‚Äôt let go of this baby rocket, papa Elon hasn‚Äôt even installed the electric jets to the rocket yet.

     Think, right now majority of games are sold/downloaded through Microsoft and Sony. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong and there‚Äôs actually a 3rd party distributor (other than the publisher of course). 

Now imagine these following possibilities 

1) Downloaded games on hard drives can be saved and redistributed.
                A)You trade in your old Xbox or old play station. You can wipe the hard drives of personal data while saving game data... set new serial numbers to the data so it can be redownloaded and distributed to hard drives for future play/backwards comparability.
               B) this comes with the possibility of game stop exclusive releases of new consoles with pre loaded hard drives that contain used games they‚Äôve purchased off older hard drives. 

2) game stop takes a more aggressive stance on the  competitive game scene with in person tournaments.
                A) possible partnership with twitch/other streaming services. This could happen sooner rather than later because multiple game stop locations could have large tournaments with retail locations around the world.
                B) with possible twitch partnerships this could bring revenue for more twitch steamer merchandise being moved in retail locations. 
 
3) Sec finds shares of GME are in none existence and they fuck us over and claim x amount of ‚Äúfake‚Äù stock will be reclaimed (maybe at face value) from the most recent x purchases.
                A) I‚Äôm holding onto what I got until the end, because a funny feeling tells me as this all plays out we might see some wild shit to say the least. 
                B) until everything settles with the suits and the many lawsuits I‚Äôll be holding my shares. Although if it drops below $30 I am eating it up, no crumbs left behind. 

                                       Summary

               I‚Äôm in no way a financial advisor, this is not investment advice. I truly like the stock and I believe with the growing possibilities for future e-game distribution and multiple innovative minds at the helm of GameStop, this train can turn around and bring us back to the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

My fellow investors! These past few days have been challenging, we all know that! We have lost both brothers and sisters through the plague that is the hedgefunds scaretacticts via bots, trying to separate us. 

We have come to a fork in the road, and while I know that following the advice on keeping it all going is hard. We all just need to stay put and have FAITH! All the right numbers are in place and it is a fact that the squeeze is coming sooner than later. We just need to see this through, not just for ourselfes, but for eachother!

We all have a dream! Not just to buy that Lamborghini... But to pay off medicalbills, help a parent, a significant other, be free!

I am 19 years old and studying
I earn around 450‚Ç¨ (which I complete Safe for future rn) a month and my savings are around 5k‚Ç¨. I am specualating with stocks around 6 months now and I wouldn‚Äôt say I am a complete noob. I invested 1k+ of my money and was doing okay. Then gamestop come up I just observed it in the first weeks to understand the situation. Last weeks Monday I started with daytrading GME since it was so volatile. I bought at 240‚Ç¨ and sold at 300‚Ç¨. (I did this 2 times and made a solid profit of 100‚Ç¨) Last Thursday before the robinhood event I got greedy and gone all in (bought 3@330‚Ç¨) since it was only raising each day. For my bad it was only going down from then on.
Every hour I checked this reddit for news. Almost everyone of you is saying hold but still nothing changed. Today I decided to sell 3@50. I lost 850‚Ç¨ which is a punch in my face. 
I sold bc of 2 reasons. Reason 1 is to don‚Äôt loose all(I probably could sell at a better price maybe 60-80‚Ç¨ but at this point I don‚Äôt care about 50-100‚Ç¨ more)
Reason 2 is the big punch. My family is relatively poor and 1k is much for us. We will not die or anything without this money but still it was hard to convince my parents to get myself into stocks(even if it is my money) . From now on they  want me to stop with stocks(which i did only for my future so I can learn until I earn a big amount of money and invest 500‚Ç¨+ a month) And it is going to be much harder to convince them to let me spend money to start a business (or whatever things there are which requires you to spend money on before you can start making some)(for example I did reselling shoes or building website and so on) 

My advice for you is do whatever you want lol.",2021-02-05 17:20:07

Some of you are learning adult shit currently. you are learning you are impulsive and scared. You see green dildos and get happy and red dildos makes you panic sale.

Why do you feel that way? Because you didn't write down when to get in or when to get out. How much are you willing to set on fire or try and save.  you just saw dollar signs and acted like a child.  

What is occurring is separating the children from the adults. 

Not on who is üíéüôå or üìúüôå.  

It is those that accept the outcome and those that are bargaining on this is how we can still win or bitch that you lost x. 

Adults accept the decisions they make. They make adjustments and learn from their mistakes. They don't keep coming up with excuses  or finding further justification for a decision they already made.  

You bet your X and lost it all because you saw a meme? Accept that you are an idiot and don't do that next time. Expensive mistake but one i hope you don't repeat.  Take some time off and then come back with a plan. 

Know what you can lose and accept the outcome. be it rocket ships or lent in your wallet. 

old saying hope for the best plan for the worst. 

you will sleep a lot better once you do.

what do you think they were doing when they restricted BUYING? how did it go from $100-400 when no one could actually buy? maybe because they were the only ones BUYING and covering their shorts, then shorting it all the way down to $50 now (meaning they doubled down)

you don't need to see the reports when you understand the mechanics and the obvious reason they restricted buying for EVERYONE BUT THEM (fraudulent covering technique)

so some of you may be asking then, how does this work?

let me break it down for you

it's quite simple, basically, you are allowed to sell shares (short sell), without even having the borrowed shares in your possession (which ends up being a failure-to-deliver)

meanwhile, if there's too much buying, the very same people (DTCC) that allow *infinite shorting,* turns off buying, by increasing ""capital requirements"", preventing infinite squeezing. basically, one side is capped, but not the other. and the cap, just so happens to give the **shorters, the** ***perfect opportunity to cover, and double down.***

 1. The media is used to manipulate market sentiment and build counter factual narratives.
 2. Retail investors have power in numbers, but (for now) cannot control the narrative.
 3. It's easier to spread pessimism than hope. Shorts have the easiest narrative. ""If it bleeds it leads.""
 4. Brokers, Prime Brokers, and Clearing Houses need much more scrutiny, these are the true whales.
 5. Retail fighting against Prime Brokers and Clearing Houses is like picking up pennies in front of an invisible steam roller. Be careful.
 6. Order flow is more important the capital flow.
 7. Short interest reports are essentially meaningless due to time delay.
 8. Something very strange went on with all of the BANG stocks and several other stocks. Forensic accountants will be all over these two weeks. Expect at least one book explaining what happened.
 9. The SEC only gets involved after the fact, not during an event.
 10. The meme economy is real. We blew up Robinhood using nothing but memes.
 11. Citadel is named appropriately.
 12. Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry is himself a black swan.

Story Time from pits of the CBOT,5,ld1p7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1p7c/story_time_from_pits_of_the_cbot/,0,1612537264.0,"I interned at a proprietary trading firm for a couple of summers. I basically got paid to smuggle lunch onto the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade. They made markets in the Spoos, which are big S&P 500 futures contracts, 250x mutiplier (instead of the normal 100).\* They also made markets in the E-minis, SPX, and the OEX (S&P 100 contacts). 

\**A single Spoo future today has a notional value of around $950,000.¬†These guys traded fucking size.*

The head trader, Ben (not his real name), was trying to sell a shitload of way out-of-the-money puts, which would‚Äôve made hundreds of thousands in premium, which is a lot of money for a 12 person operation. This was also during the 2017-2018 low vol markets, which was brutal for index market makers. At the time, the firm was doing a lot of business through a guy named Mike (fake name), who was a show broker (a guy who works with big clients and sends potential orders to market makers). Ben was trying to do a not held order, which is giving the broker time and price discretion; basically trusting Mike to get the best fill possible. We just got a message on the order, and Mike filled it at a shit price and a far lower quantity than we wanted. Ben got fucking angry and blurted out this absolute gem:

**""Tell him to fucking suck it, tell him to fucking blow me. He won‚Äôt do it and then he‚Äôll laugh in our face about it like the cunt that he is. He‚Äôs got a pool of guys allergic to water.‚Äù**

But if you sold it, show some damned respect to the holders that held through the highs. Stop with the sarcastic ""told you so"" or ""I saw it coming, why couldn't you"" comments. This was never about logic or smart decision-making. It was about values. The holders stood for something greater than themselves. 

Trading's a zero sum game. Many of us were bound to be left behind in this game. To those that held and lost money, great respect to you. If this were a physical war, you'd've won the Purple Heart. Whether you own one share or many thousands of shares, you've been partaking in something that will not be replicated again until many decades later. That has to count for something. Money isn't everything. Even on WSB. The faster you realize this, the better you will trade, not that it's a 1:1 relationship, but somehow it holds true all the time. 

They can take away your money, but your dignity and honor, that, no one can ever take, other than yourself. 

**Positions:** I never Yolo'd into GME/AMC/NOK, but I'm bag holding enough shares and calls to feel uncomfortable. The Hf's probably covered most of their shorts at this point (definitely not all). 

**So what's the play?** Well Robinhood lifted restrictions. We're at an ath in terms of new retail money flowing into the markets, and hf's are literally looking to rotate from the ath qqq and s&p stonks to try out one of the stonks we like. I mean, Blackrock increased their positions in AMC and Nok for crying out loud. 

Thus, experience tells me that it's better to hold, because there'll be some kind of mean reversion.

Beloved icons of our youth.. next they expose it being shorted by hedge funds, not to screw the hedge funds that yes, actually lost money up front, but convinced every average Joe, or retard, to invest heavily in the stock. Hedge funds lost and they made that public to fuel more cash from everyone. Once it hit high, the hedge funds stopped buying ability and once again shorted the stock with huge returns. If they shorted it at $40, imagine shorting at $400 so more value. All the while they tell people to keep investing and hold. So they basically convinced everyone to invest their money, lose their ass, and hedge funds still win. I bet they are laughing because people literally call themselves retards now. They orchestrated the entire thing. Reddit and hedge funds biggest conspiracy ever! Nobody will go to jail. Same shit different scenario.

Hello, my name is hollywood_harpoon

I have a verified 10 year account, but you will never hear from me because I have no karma. I‚Äôve never needed it before before this moment. You all have dug deep, and if you are going to fight legendary battles you are going to wake legendary beasts. Ive broke radio silence to stand with you. You think Balrogs give fuks about Karma? Im awake and want nothing more than to stand beside you in this moment, all I hope is that my voice can make it to you.

I have never cried harder in my life than today, but I want you to know what I am about to tell you is no sob story, because of you all, these tears are diamonds running down my face!

I am a 15 year veteran of filmmaking in Hollywood. I have been in the trenches with the best of them: Malick, Speilberg, P.T.A and at least 100 other directors. I know the moderators are looking for a film maker and I want to tell you I am your guy.

Right now the moderators are looking at a lot of director‚Äôs high light reels, I know exactly the type of people submitting, it‚Äôs the same people who have been passing me by in promotions all my life, just because their parents can afford them all the money in the world to make their reels, I know these people inside out and I can hear their nervous jabbering from here and it greatly annoys me.

I don‚Äôt have a flashy reel to show you, all I have is the most retarded website with the most retarded film on it. Please take a look. http://iamthewalrus.com/ . What you are looking at is legitimately dumb, it‚Äôs a website that I put all my money into 8 years ago, trying to sell one shirt that reads, ‚ÄúProperty of The U.S. Banking System‚Äù. The still is from a short I directed, predicting the Caveman rioting at the capitol 8 years before it happened. People thought I was dumb then, and I haven‚Äôt done a damn thing to change their mind since.

I only sold 1 shirt in 8 years, to my mom, because she is the only one that believed in me. Today, I found out she might have Covid on the same day she was due to get her first shot of the vaccine, and she is very high risk. I‚Äôm stuck in Australia and wont be able to make it back in time to make sure she will be ok.

Why would I ever keep a website up for 8 years when it has only sold 1 shirt? Because, when I believe in something I hold onto it!

Why am I holding GME?

Because, I remember when I was 19 years old driving an ambulance for Rural Metro in Arizona. We were making minimum wage and 2 weeks before we were to unionize we were all laid off. At that moment there was only two things I knew. 1. There was nothing I could do. 2. One day, I would be back for ALL of these mother fuckers!

I remember working as a security guard at a hospital when a lot of us were about to get our 1 year raise, they told us they didn‚Äôt have it in the budget. That same week they unveiled a very flashy, very expensive and big, plasma TV in the lobby showing nothing but a digital fish tank. I still think about that fish tank sometimes before I go to sleep. Remember this: Sometimes the biggest regrets you make; are of all the things you didn‚Äôt break!

I remember working 90 hour weeks for Inarritu on, The Revenant. I loved the work and still love the film, but I lost my health insurance working for him.

Ive spent the last 3 years homeless, staying in the seediest parts of the world, but for me, they have been castles because I get to do something I believe in. I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way, Im retarded like that!

Im so retarded, after 15 years of hard work, my greatest achievement is a stupid little article written here, read to the end and see if you can guess who I am. https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/paying-the-price-for-a-trip-to-the-cinema-20130530-2ne3d.html?fbclid=IwAR2rkyPyqZcO46Nv1CcAk6ik9XdzQu-xMZF0c5VwQ9OsfuknDYikRVWCkn0

So, Im sure whoever the mods find for their filmmaker will be just fine. But, if I ever meet that filmmaker in person, Im going to crush them with my balls just because I can. I made you a dumb little video but I don‚Äôt think I can ever get it on here, I don‚Äôt know if you will ever hear me. These mods are a little dumb, even for my taste, and I eat dog shit for living.

My name is Hollywood_harpoon, because my people are whale-hunters, Inupiat Eskimo from the arctic circle. I was born a whale-hunter, I am sure as fuck going to die a whale-hunter.

I was born for this moment and been working hard for it and I brought the receipts, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3680307/

I don‚Äôt have much, but everything I have is with you. If I have to go back to the streets and eat dog shit tomorrow, I want you to know, it will be the greatest meal I‚Äôve ever had, because for the first time in my life, I will be eating at the table of Kings and Queens.

Fuck Covid. Fuck homelessness. Fuck poverty. Fuck Inarritu. Most of all, fuck these Hedge Funds!

They say there are no atheists in fox holes. Fuck that! The only gods I need are the ones standing beside me in this battle. Im a whale hunter and will always be a whale hunter.

It takes a lot of losses, some wins, smart position sizing and plenty of frustration to be successful at trading.

Emotions have no place in trading, never get emotional about a stock, it doesn't care about your sorry ass one bit. 

Most people trade on emotion, they get FOMO and buy near the high. Then get scared and sell at the low

*The market is designed to take advantage of your fear and greed.*

Gamestop holders won the battle, but failed to take advantage of it ....by selling the stock at $300 to $400. 

The stock is worth maybe $20, but you guys pushed it to over $400 because of the crazy high short interest,  your buying and online marketing. ....Amazing.

You guys should have been selling GME at $400, the stock was insanely overvalued at that price, that was your win. Then you should have joined the sellers and bought puts and/ or short it back to $100.

Then you might have had enough money to make a real statement for the next target.

The system will not let you destroy it to make a statement, so you should not be surprised that it changed the rules when it was threatened (this has happened many times in history)

If you really want to change wall street, it will take massive amounts of capital transferred from them to you to use against them next time.

does literally everything hinge on this USPS contract? After doing some more reading, one one hand the Biden announcement/hype about converting the govt fleet to EVs makes this feel like it can shoot up more over next month or so. But I can‚Äôt shake that Biden‚Äôs endorsement is more for show vs. a dictation of what the USPS will actually do. 

WKHS is a startup with production limitations, their largest order ~7K. There is no shot they would be the sole winner of this contract with that lack of experience and resources. 

The USPS is also not federally funded and they will have to pay for the vehicles. I can see this becoming very bureaucratic, with the USPS cheaping out opting for short term cheaper costs vs. long term savings. EVs tend to be higher upfront cost but save you $ on maintenance blah blah blah. 

So idk, ultimately I‚Äôd guess WKHS gets a portion of the contract to save face for Biden and the govt ‚Äúgoing green‚Äù but with Ford in the mix and their production infrastructure/deep roots in American culture and prob the govt, I can totally see them getting the lions share of the contract...it being spun  as ‚Äúcreating American jobs for one of the greatest American car companies etc.‚Äù

Idk, might throw a call in it. I like the company and that they‚Äôre kind of an underdog in some ways, since this was a penny stock less than almost half a year ago. but not sure if the money boat has already been missed and gains ahead are limited.

One day a company disrupted the market and shock the masses: Apple and the Iphone.
It changed the way we use phones, remember those Palm Treo? I had a 680, was cool but the iphone? omg!
then Google partner with HTC to bring their phones to the market, the rest we all know what happened to each company üíÄ, we lived the race and the battle, it was a OS battle: iOS  vs Android, who won? both, both are still alive, BB, NOK, HTC are gone, now the new battle forming is on the EV space and now is time to make ""SmartCars"" Tesla slipped under both Google and Apple and now they both can see the potential of the upcoming events AKA üíµ,.
-Apple + Hyundai +Canoo
VS
-Google + Ford
VS
-Tesla

The rest players are the ones who will pick up the crumbles.
Whatever side you pick is a win, for me I'll be investing... INVESTING... Long term, 10 years, NO pump and dump, no BS üöÄ and moon dumb shit fake bull runs, this is like buying apple before the iphone and the same to the rest of the companies.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

You need a certain number of people to pull this off.  I can see doing it to cause a short squeeze, but telling everyone to hold as it's dropped 75%+ is raising alarm bells in my head. 

Perhaps someone with a good working knowledge of stock trading is counting on leading a group of less-than-sophisiticated investors who know just enough to get themselves in trouble.

Every day I wake up hoping GME drops in value so I can buy more. This, combined with the amount of shares you greedy fucks shorted makes this a glorious investment. 

You know it, we know it. We knew this would happen from the start, which is why we're here. I'm currently laughing my ass off while eating popcorn seeing you desperately trying to unfuck the situation you fucked yourselves into, knowing there's no way out.

You're counting so heavily on your belief that you're smarter than us, but I'm sure by now you'll have realized this is not the case. Both greed and arrogance contribute to your downfall, so you'll excuse me if I exhibit signs of Schadenfreude.

All I had to do was buy and hold, but your futile attempts at manipulation actually made it possible for me to invest more money. We might be autistic, but you're fucking stupid. 

By trying to unfuck the situation, you're digging your grave deeper, trying to bluff yourself out of the situation. I'm sorry, but it won't work. We know how the stock market works and we know that you've infiltrated this sub.

How this sub fucked newbies. TL;DR: We need to call out the difference between retarded DD and desperate denying reality DD,282,ld15ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld15ve/how_this_sub_fucked_newbies_tldr_we_need_to_call/,57,1612534956.0,"Hey there. So... I have been in this sub for years upon years mostly lurking but occasionally commenting. I witnessed when the one million subs cherry was popped and I was here through SLV gang and jarred tech the big gay. I have seen a lot, and I have seen what this subreddit is and what it means to be an autist.

I am going to be honest, at first I was completely on board with GME. I thought it was a beautiful thing, all of us getting together to fuck a hedge fund, David vs. Goliath, the little guy versus the giant. To be fair, to a point it was.

But there is a certain point where you realize that shit has gone south. It‚Äôs the point where people start utterly denying reality, or arguing with eachother over what is or isn‚Äôt reality. That‚Äôs what I saw happen with GME.

Post after post, day after day, that is all this sub was. GME, GME, and more GME. Millions flooded in. GME. A Twitter account was made. GME. Did it ever occur to you guys that caution might have been necessary? It didn‚Äôt occur to me for too long, and I feel incredibly guilty about it

We are experienced here. A lot of us will joke about being retarded because we are, but we know how the market works. I don‚Äôt wanna fucking hear the whole ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt‚Äù, because you know what? Compared to the millions of **brand new** traders that joined this sub, we are.

These people had no clue what this place was, or what they were doing, but they saw post after post of DD saying ‚Äúlook! It‚Äôs going to go back up! It‚Äôs fine! $1,000!‚Äù. They saw big walls of texts with words they understood fuck all about, and took it as fact because they trusted us

Instead of questioning the DD, we went along with it. Even as it got more and more desperate. There is a point where the same people doing the DD are just trying to convince themselves, and the cult like mentality GME caused made any questioning of this be chalked up to ‚Äúbots‚Äù and ‚Äúshills‚Äù

Fuck that. We need to be better than this. **There is a difference between autistic DD and something that is just plain stupid, and this community should have been more willing to tell people that the desperate as fuck DD was just that, desperate as fuck**

I‚Äôm guilty of this to. Like it or not fuckers, we are at the big boys table now. It‚Äôs up to us to try and make sure that we don‚Äôt get into the mentality where we convince ourselves that the tendies need a little more time in the oven while they are fucking burning

So, because of that, I would like to ask the mods *to please sticky a post for new traders that basically tells them to be really fucking careful*, and for us as a community to pull ourselves together and not become a cult when a meme stock of this magnitude comes around.

I love you retards, I really do. It‚Äôs up to us to keep wallstreetbets full of loss porn that people are expecting instead of new idiots to the game who throw their student loans on shit because this is how they‚Äôll be rich

Why exactly is GME going to jump up? It seems like the going theory is that the Hedgey Boys are going to have to cover their positions and it's going to bump the market, but I also think I see that the main reason is that they are going to have to cover at a high if not higher price than they initially shorted for. But will they? It seems like they already did the market fuckery while we were all holding our dicks in bed so that they can cover at a reasonable price. And we already know they did the Short 2 Electric Boogaloo right around when Robin hood was corporate shilling, while prices were high. So wouldnt it be true that although they lost money hand over fist in the beginning, they are covering the stocks sold when it was 300 beans, now during a time when its just 90 bone?

Listen I'm dumb as rocks, but how are they not fucking us up the ass right now? The way I see it they will just short this stock all the way to the floor and the only one that loses is all of us idiots who bought a meme stock at the absolute peak.

There is a lot going around that there must be a plot to undercut the market because if not why are they pulling such underhand fuckery with the false Silver story and the online boxing us out of the trading floor. We think that they are afraid of us holding, but what if we don't matter any more to them than the hundred dollar bills they wipe with. What if there isn't any plot to make us sell because they NEED us to sell, what if they would just LIKE us to sell so they get the hookers and blow earlier than next week. 

I honestly want someone to explain why this isn't a rigged game. I feel a little like a guy stealing the fresh fruit from the porno set.

GME,48,ld12ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld12ew/gme/,11,1612534556.0,Hedgefunds are like sharks. They shorted the company 140 percent because they want to bankrupt it so they dont have to buy the shares back after it goes out of business. The fundimentals of gamestop have not changed and there would be no reason to double down. Go back and look at the volkswagon squeeze. It didnt happen in 2 days like that spike that happened last week. It actually did the same exact thing and then sunk to low lows and then you need a catalyst like someone buying a ton of shares. There needs to be momentum right now of a lot of retail buying forcing the price up to make the shorts suffer. This is why hf have been so scared and trying to scare people off driving the price down. There has not been a lot of volume so the reason the stock is going down is because they are shorting it heavily thus bringing the price down. Do you actually think they would spend so much money or have spies enter this reddit or try to get you to sell or spend a fortune in ladder attacks or try to get you to buy silver then tank it the next day or limit your buying power? They are trying to make you doubt yourselves and sell. The volkswagon spike happened over months. Infact it hit prices if 450 and 500 before going back down. This was before the squeeze happened. I urge you to pull up the stock prices daily for that whole year and see for yourself. We are literally in the middle of the squeeze. We need a lot more volume to cause an upwards momentum.,2021-02-05 16:15:56

I know some of you weirdos out there certainly believe in this shit, but we're going to get our tin-foil hats on here.

Drastic times call for drastic measures.

We'll need a few things:

- Candles
- 3 Chickens
- Natenberg's Option Volatility & Pricing
- Powerball/Mega Millions tickets (optional)

We're going to talk about chicken sacrifices to the market gawds in dedication to Papa Jerome Powell (peace be upon him) and hope some of this QE flows your way.

I read once in a great investing book, this is what the glowies at rival hedge funds do to generate phaat (yes with ph) gainz.
 
First, we need a copy of our options trading bible, yes natenberg - ah you've never heard of it? that's why you might find yourself in this position old sport!

Second, we need some candles for ambience. Can't make money if your vibe isn't right. Ok. 

Third, now this isn't where its very clear - but this is my takeaway - I've read that for every 2 chickens, you can exchange your newly minted paper bag for 25% refund. With a 3rd, we unlock a tier which has only been seen by a few.

Fourth we have to chant ""GME AMC APE TOGETHER DUMB, SPCE AMD BETTER TRADES, x100.

Then from there it just works. Maybe even pick up some Powerball & Mega Millions tickets as an insurance policy

‚ÄúSomething critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,‚Äù - Ryan Cohen ([King Cohen](https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/chewy-s-ryan-cohen-lays-out-warren-buffett-lessons-explains-apple-bet-76ff53c22e74c719f59c810aaad0618355fc8835) )

RIGHT NOW THE HERD ARE THE SHORTS, and KING COHEN WILL SILENCE THE NAY SAYERS. KING Cohen knows that ""GameStop is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market"" ([letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf))

We are just getting started and I ain't hear no bell yet. Hold the line with DIAMOND HANDS. If KING Cohen is in I'm still in, If DFV is in, I'm still in. HOLD and BTFD. 

This current market situation is so similar to TSLA back in the days with all the bears and all (ie: BAML thinking this is worth 1.50$, and we got shorts thinking this stock is the next blockbuster and going to 0$ since it will never turn around from a brick & mortar store). Well, If that is the case, then why do you think Cohen invested in the company and loaded up on more shares after it became $15 ? This is because it ain‚Äôt over and WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄ so be patient my fellow apes.

P.S: this is not financial advice and I am NOT comparing GameStop to TESLA, I‚Äôm just saying the market conditions are similar.

YOLO trade strategy for Investors who kept getting FCKed this week.,9,ld0tio,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0tio/yolo_trade_strategy_for_investors_who_kept/,33,1612533602.0,"As a financial analyst with 2 weeks in Wall Street Bets. I believe that I can share this view with you since I have the same experience as any Harvard or Yale grad has when they join a wall street hedge fund. 

Instead the media and hedge funds taking WSB investors for dead. It would be a good strategy to make a very public statement that WSB is here to stay. The top two stocks that the media connects WSB with is GME and AMC. While it would be awesome it where GME, its just too expensive. 

Any investor who has the ability and wants to believe that WSB can be a hedge fund for the masses the best way to do so is by converting GME stock to AMC. Right now roughly 1 GME = 5 AMC stocks. Anybody who would follow this strategy that owns GME would increase their leverage 5X against the AMC shorts. This strategy is not just about those that own GME if there are autists who don't own GME they would still benefit buying the stock as it is cheaper than pre pandemic levels. The timing of this strategy is good. This is at the end of the week which means that whoever is managing their shorts are going to rebalance for the next week. (research pending) This is a perfect time to force the short squeeze. 

Full Disclosure: own 1000 AMC stock at $7.14 this is not financial advice

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.‚Äú

My post in the WSB today gathered lots of attention to my surprise 

28k it shows me liked my post and with that came a flood of messages from our fellow tards one who wants to stay unknown and one who wasnt permitted to post on WSB yet. 


The first message is as follows 

I have a point that needs to be heard. But can't post as i'm new here.

I work in finance sector. I am a PI on etoro, don't tell anyone as I want to remain anonymous.

People are losing hope. But the squeeze is nearly here. Holding the line is not enough & may not activate the squeeze.

Looking at the data, the price dropping do to supply and demand issues. People are not buying enough. This means price drops = fear, more people sell.

120% are still short with more contracts set to expire on Friday. If the price increase to $150-200 I belie the squeeze would be hit as the new contracts would cause this.

As it stands, the margins are not being called and they appear to be winning. ALL YOU NEED IS TO HOLD & PUSH ONCE MORE FOR THE SHORT SQUEEZE.

This is just my personal view. But maybe it should be heard.


Second message is from

A lot of grave dancing on this sub recently. Important to remember a few things though,230,ld0p92,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0p92/a_lot_of_grave_dancing_on_this_sub_recently/,81,1612533119.0,"There is a lot of schadenfreude going on and talking about how idiotic people were for not selling their GME at $300+


But it's important to remember that none of the bag holders here made a dumb decision to hold.  Not actually.  They got giga-fucked by the brokers when they restricted buying, something nobody saw coming and was basically a totally unprecedented move, and completely cratered momentum.  And it gave the hedge funds and shorters critical time to cover their most toxic positions to prevent complete destruction.  That stock really was about to üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, then they pulled the rug right out from under everyone.


Everyone who bought at $300+ saw the evidence and jumped on the momentum.  They made the right choice.  The choice was so right in fact that they got a media, wall street & politicians scrambling for how to deal with it.  They got Citadel to bail out Melvin Capital, and they got the clearing houses and market makers to restrict selling.  


The DD was right.  We were fucking the hedge funds and beating them at their own game.  They were caught with their pants down.



The main issue is that traders didn't know how long the buy-restriction would be in effect.  Would it be restricted 1 hour? 4 hours?  By the time they undid the restriction to an acceptable level (basically today), it was already too late.



So now the situation has turned from a get rich quick & fuck the hedge funds scheme to a more traditional long play.  With a small chance of a short term spike if something major happens.



Gamestop has all the attention it could have ever asked for.  And most of their new shareholders are likely their PRIME demographic that they would love to have back, and now have every reason in the world to help them succeed.




If Cohen plays his cards right and knows what he's doing, he can turn Gamestop into a legitimate competitor to Steam a la the Epic Games Store, as well as compete with NewEgg if they can pivot into PC hardware & culture, which is a huge market that is basically totally untapped for them right now.



There is still money to be made in GME stock.  However it will more likely take a year or two (or more) instead of a week or two.



But I don't think it's fair to call people idiots for getting in late and/or not selling.  We should be sympathizing with them for getting fucked by the system so hard with blatant corruption.  Not making fun of them.   It's not your fault if you get cheated on, even if the signs may have been there in retrospect.


Anyway, let the retards have their fun.   It's nice to have some hope in this fucked up world every once in a while.


So I'm gonna go to Gamestop first for all my gaming needs from now on, and I'm gonna hold some GME stock.  Not worth it to sell at this point anyway.",2021-02-05 15:51:59

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.‚Äú",2021-02-05 15:40:03

&#x200B;

This community is all over the place. And for good reason. With millions joining the sub in a matter of weeks and the single greatest meme event in Wall Street history, there‚Äôs a lot of misinformation and clouded sentiment. Compounded by internal politics and manipulation.

Turn all of that off for a second and hear some real wisdom.

Here‚Äôs the DD for y‚Äôall that haven‚Äôt been around for more than a month. For credibility and backstory: I‚Äôve been following u/DeepFuckingValue (our Lord and Savior) since July. We all knew who Roaring Kitty was on YouTube and his DD and streams were the shit! Go checkout his channel and you‚Äôll understand where you‚Äôre actually sitting at on charts (hint: probably holding the bag currently) but don‚Äôt get discouraged yet!

Back when GME was a pitiful $4, DFV was sharing fundamentals as well as speculation that the stock was worth $50-80. That‚Äôs likely what the price will reflect long term. However, the case for a short squeeze was a bonus and really memed hard in December. That‚Äôs what probably lead a lot of you noobs to this sub.

So what does that mean for the future? Shorts are still high. 20% short interest is considered extreme. Conservative (and likely manipulated) estimates still show interest above 50%. Fuck the float hype and short squeeze. The reality is you don‚Äôt need the hype for the obviously bullish moves coming throughout 2021 on GME. Most of you retards have probably lost 70% or more, so there‚Äôs no real reason to fret or stress about losing more anyways, right?! Instead, here‚Äôs what you do:

Cost average at this current dip. Meaning buy more with whatever disposable income you‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs going to have support based on the 50 day moving average and fundamentals. The stock should be trading at $80-100 in my opinion and based on (mostly) fundamentals. GME earnings in March are likely to make a case for positive outlook for the company to $100 and beyond through 2021. You may not see it rise to $300+ this year if you bought the top, but you may realize some conservative gains that net you some profits or at least break even. Optimistically, there‚Äôs still a really good chance the squeeze has a round 2, but don‚Äôt count on it. Make the long term play if you like the company and stock and just hold. Learn your lessons and get better at due diligence.

Do what makes sense for you, and always do your own research. Yea, we‚Äôre degenerates/retards/autists but many of us in this sub are also ridiculously smart and wear those labels ironically. We just like to have fun and make stupid bets with our tendies. That‚Äôs the whole premise here, and I don't think anyone expected the surge of idiots that just follow along blindly. This is never meant to be financial advice. Just a place to laugh, learn, and love; while eating shit or tendies depending on the day!",2021-02-05 15:31:35

I feel like this attitude is due to people investing what they couldn't lose on a BET (hence, wallstreet**bets**).

I will not tell you guys what to do because I am not a financial advisor. I can only say that we have made history and can continue to do so. In the end, it seems like if we go to 0 or $1000+ we have become divided and that's exactly what they want from us.

An In Depth Look Into Aphria (APHA.TO) And Why This Stock Should Be A 4x Bagger At Least,39,lcvy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvy7b/an_in_depth_look_into_aphria_aphato_and_why_this/,15,1612517396.0,"\*\*\**This is a slightly edited verison of my post in* r/stocks\*. I tried posting the DD here before but it got removed by Auto-mod and I got temporarily banned. \*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

**The play**: Long stocks and ATM leap calls

Summary: Aphria is trading at a hefty discount when comparing price multiples to its largest viable competitor Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO). As of the release of the company‚Äôs recent Q2 2021 financial statement, Aphria now has more revenue and a much lower net loss than Canopy Growth; however, despite all that, Canopy still has a market cap that is 4 times larger than Aphria. This I believe is a major pricing inefficiency created by the market because both companies are showing significant growth in their revenue while capturing additional market share in a growing industry while only Aphria has shown investors that is the only dominant marijuana company that can cut down costs and increase profit margins. Because of this, the premium in Canopy‚Äôs market cap is not justifiable and Aphria should be valued at least as much or even more than Canopy Growth.

&#x200B;

**Industry Background Info**

Ever since the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2018, Canadian weed companies have risen to become the dominant players on the global stage. As of right now, the four largest weed companies by market cap are Canopy Growth (WEED.TO), Cronos (CRON.TO), Aphria (APHA.TO), and Aurora (ACB.TO).

Of this grouping, only Aphria has consistently shown investors that it can grow its business from both the top and bottom lines all the while making mergers and acquisitions that will allow it to capitalize on the growing recreational market in the U.S. Here let me show you why Aphria has the strongest fundamentals.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hguojmpiakf61.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=72e816543fa581371895f42aa6ce940e9ab392ca

If you pull up Canopy‚Äôs recent quarterly report and look at their income statement, you will find that even though cost of goods sold (COGS) has a slightly decreased ratio to revenue from 76% for the first 3 quarters in 2019 (145,162 / 189,012) to 78% in 2020 (213,107 / 269,916), its total operating expenses excluding COGS, is still **LARGER** than its revenue (operating expenses are 489,216 for 2021). What‚Äôs more is that over half of this comes from SGA (Selling, General, and Admin). What this shows is that even though the company is growing, it is not becoming more efficient, rather it is becoming more inefficient.

[link](https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf)

As for the other two companies Cronos and Aurora, their fundamentals are even more atrocious than Canopy‚Äôs. Cronos has revenue roughly 29million for first three quarters of 2020 which is peanuts compared to Aphria and Canopy. What‚Äôs more is that the company is showing earnings that are HIGHER than their total revenue. I suspect this is a result of their revaluation of their marijuana inventory which is complete bullshit because it assumes company can sell it all at the current fair market price and no auditor can accurately assess the true value of a living and growing agricultural product (trust me my background is in accounting). Why this company is worth over 5bil is beyond me. Aurora is similar with tiny amounts of revenue while operating at massive losses. The company didn‚Äôt even sell anything in 20q2 so I‚Äôm not going to go into great depth with either of them.

***Tl;Dr:*** *The only viable competitor with Aphria is Canopy and right now Canopy is making less money than Aphria both in the top and bottom lines. The other two companies are essentially the weird kid in the class sitting in a corner eating chalk. Bless their hearts.*

&#x200B;

**Aphria Fundamentals**

Alright let‚Äôs get to the good stuff. Here is a pic of part of their income statement for you to follow:

[link](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xjdudb3kakf61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=d73b5cbc5ee704f1295fb04f46593e67993f19bf

Right now, COGS ratio for Aphria is comparable with Canopy. By Nov 2020, ratio is 71% (219,136 / 306,221) and 74% (188,670 / 246,712) in 2019. But if you go down the statement you will find out that in the breakdown of their operating expenses, the company actually manages to keep expenses relatively stable as revenue grows. The only line that really stands out for me is the transaction cost expense of 25.6m which relates to business acquisitions. I think most of the 25.6m is related to their Tilray acquisition that I will discuss later on. Other than that, the company manages to stabilize its expenses and its total operating cost is far less than their revenue, which is something Canopy cannot say.

[link](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

***Tl;dr:*** *Aphria is a lean machine while Canopy is like a toddler that took one too many steroids and suddenly grew to the size of a NFL linebacker all the while having an IQ of 4. What this means is that Canopy‚Äôs growth is by no means sustainable and the only way for the company to continue operations is if it manages to grow revenue fast enough it outpaces expenses, but right now that is not the case.*

T**ilray Merger Implications**

Recently in 2020 Aphria announced an all-stock merger that will be carried out by a reverse stock split **(meaning Aphria will exchange 0.8 APHA shares per TLRY share**). After the merger is finalized, Aphria will control 63% of Tilray. One of the key advantages of the reverse split is that it decreases the amount of total shares outstanding, making the shares more valuable.

This is something I feel like retail investors need to look at more closely. The reason why is that the merger will give Aphria a strategic advantage of breaking into the US and EU markets.

On a final point, the merger with Tilray will also let Aphria directly compete with Canopy Growth Corp in the marijuana beverage industry.

For those of you that don't know, Constellation Brands own a 38% stake in CGC. This investment is pivotal to the company's ability to produce cannabis-infused beverages at their plant in Smith Falls Ontario. What people often overlook with the Aphria-Tilray merger though is that Tilray has an agreement with AB InBev, the world's largest brewer [link](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/10/10/tilray-ab-inbev-to-launch-cbd-drinks-in-late-2019-thc-drinks-to-come-later.html). This agreement has allowed Tilray to launch their own drinks in late 2019, thus allowing them to be competitive with Canopy in the drinks market as well.

The advantage comes from the fact that even though Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. What‚Äôs more is that Tilray also has agreements with EU countries that allow it to expand its position in the EU cannabis market. Tilray has announced it has been selected by the French national Agency for the Safety of medicines and Health Products to supply Good Manufacturing Processes certified medical cannabis products in France. In addition, the company also has agreements with other EU nations like Portugal that you can examine at your own free time.

***Tl;Dr****: Aphria buy Tilray. Tilray in U.S and deal with E.U. This let Aphria go to U.S and E.U. This let Aphria bring in big mooneee.*

**U.S Marijuana Legalization**

The Democrats taking control of the White House, Senate, and Congress is the equivalent of the second coming of Christ for the marijuana industry, and no this is not an understatement. Right now, marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational uses in 15 states but is still illegal on the federal level. What this means is that companies need to wait for states to legalize individually and even when they do so, there are still significant red tapes abound that will greatly hinder industry growth. One of the most prevalent examples of red tape is the fact that marijuana dispensaries do not have access to proper banking so they operate exclusively as a cash-based business. This is because if a bank provides services to a weed dispensary, it can be charged on the federal level for money laundering.

That is all about to change because the Dems in the Senate announced that one of their main goals with their majority is to end the federal criminalization of marijuana use. In addition, Chuck Schumer already announced that a draft of the bill will be introduced in the first half of 2021.

What‚Äôs more is that when weed is legalized on the federal level, it is actually legalized on the state level as well. This is because of something called the Supremacy Clause in the constitution that established that federal law controls when state and federal law are in conflict.

*‚Äúbut* u/gushingranny1\*, if that‚Äôs the case, how come I can smoke pot in California huuuuh?‚Äù\*

Well listen here you little turd, granny going to explain to ya.

You see the constitution, though the Tenth Amendment delegates police powers to the states. This means that even though states cannot prevent federal prosecution of their citizens, they can still eliminate state prosecutions.

**Tl;Dr**: Once weed is legalized on federal level, floodgates will open. You think marijuana stocks got crazy in 2017? Just wait for this one.
